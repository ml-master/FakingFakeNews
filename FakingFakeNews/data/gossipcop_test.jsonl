In October 2016, she was held at gunpoint and bound and gagged by five burglars. The thieves stole two cellphones and approximately $10 million worth of jewelry, including a $4 million dollar ring.\n\n\"I went back to Paris to witness Kanye's BFF, Virgil Abloh, make history with his first collection and runway show for Louis Vuitton during Mens Fashion Week,\" she wrote on her website. \"It was such an emotional trip!\"\n\n\"For me, it was the perfect time to come back to a place where I fell in love, but also a place where I suffered great trauma,\" she continued. \"The trip was actually only 12 hours because right after the show, we had to fly home for Teyana Taylor\u2019s listening party the same night!\"\n\n\"Emotionally, I feel calm. I've truly put the experience behind me, and have learned and grown from it. Because of this, mentally coming back to Paris wasn't difficult for me. It feels refreshing to face my fears and overcome them. For me, there's no point in staying in a fucked-up state of mind. 'Feel it, go through it and move on' has always been how I try to live my life. I would never suggest to anyone how to grieve, I can simply say what has worked for me.\"\n\n\"I'm so happy I went back,\" Kim said. \"It was the perfect experience coming back to a city I love so much.\"\n\nAt Abloh's runway show, Kim and Kanye were also joined by Kylie Jenner and Stormy's dad Travis Scott. Kanye and Abloh have been close friends for a long time, which was shown when the rapper broke down in proud tears, as he hugged Abloh after his show.\n\nAbloh, who was appointed as artistic director of Louis Vuitton's menswear collections last March, is also the founder and CEO of Milan-based luxury brand Off-White. In other words, Abloh has many celebrity friends and fans, such as Bella Hadid, Rihanna, and Naomi Campbell, who were all also in attendance at the runway show.\n\nView Photos Instagram"}

Turns out the bevy of sexual misconduct allegations plaguing Hollywood allowed Parker to put the SATC 3 allegations into perspective.\n\n\u201cThe world shifted,\u201d she said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh this is ridiculous.\u2019 I was afraid to talk about these allegations, and now there are real allegations in the world.

The couple will celebrate their 21st anniversary in May \u2014 and all those years together, plus the years and years of split rumors, have created a deep bond between the two.\n\n\u201cRelationships are hard. I always felt that I wanted to invest more. I love him and I think he\u2019s brilliant. And I\u2019m sure I annoy him. He annoys me sometimes, but I\u2019m enormously proud of the person he is,\u201d she revealed during a candid interview with the Girlboss Radio podcast. \u201cI think the longer you can last, the more invested you just are. And so their triumphs are yours, their disappointments are yours. And the more you feel those things and experience them, the more it\u2019s hard to imagine not being part of their life.\u201d\n\nThe secret to the pair\u2019s long union? Time apart.\n\n\u201cWe have lives that allow us to be away and come back together,\u201d said Parker, who shares son James Wilkie, 15, and twin daughters, Loretta and Tabitha, 8, with Broderick. \u201cHis work life takes him here, and mine takes me there. In some ways, I think that that\u2019s been enormously beneficial because we have so much to share, in a way.\u201d\n\nWatch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen airs Sunday-Thursday (11 p.m. ET) on Bravo."}

I [had] really small lips,' the daughter of Kris and Caitlyn Jenner revealed to a therapist on the show, noting that a boy she had smooched with made an offhand remark that did damage to her psyche.\n\nOpening up: On Sunday's Life of Kylie, Kylie Jenner, 20, said that a remark a boy made to her five years ago damaged her self-esteem, leading her to eventually undergo surgical enhancement on her lips\n\n'It was like one of my first kisses and a guy was like, \"I didn\u2019t think you would be a good kisser because you have such small lips,\"' she said, adding that she 'took that really hard.'\n\nShe continued, 'Just when a guy you like says that, I don\u2019t know, it just really affected me - I just didn\u2019t feel desirable or pretty.'\n\nKylie that she 'really wanted bigger lips' and was compelled to try and use makeup to compensate for what she felt she was lacking in: 'I would overline my lips with lip liner just to create the illusion of bigger lips.'\n\nBut eventually she nixed that fix, opting to undergo cosmetic surgery to enhance her lips. She said, 'Finally I was like, \"This lip liner isn\u2019t doing it,\"' adding that she 'ended up getting [her] lips done.'\n\nThen and now: Kylie said that poor self-esteem about her lips during her teens (L) compelled her to undergo cosmetic surgery\n\nTemporary fix: The candid TV personality admitted that she tried to cover up her perceived shortcoming with makeup, but eventually turned to surgery\n\nThe therapist asked her, 'Isn't it amazing how people can just say a couple things and it's just like gets right in there?' to which she answered, 'It sticks with you.'\n\nElsewhere in the episode, the reality star blamed the stars for differences with her 'Momager' Kris and some of her other family members.\n\nKylie, during a philanthropic trip to Peru, was asked if she was more like Kris, 61, or Caitlyn Jenner, 67.\n\n'I'm not like either of them,' Kylie said during a confessional on the show.\n\nOpening up: The reality star held little back as she talked of her self-esteem issues on the show\n\nPenultimate episode: Kylie Jenner blamed differences with her family members on the stars during Sunday's episode of Life Of Kylie\n\nThe Keeping Up With The Kardashians star cited astrological reasons for contrasts with Kris, Caitlyn and even older sister Kendall Jenner, 21.\n\n'I butt heads with my parents and Kendall. It's three Scorpios against one Leo in the house. We're the worst signs to be together. We're not like compatible,' said fire sign Kylie of her water sign parents and sister. She added, 'We all have strong personalities. It's always them against me.'\n\nKylie, during the half-hour episode, traveled to Peru with her best friend Jordyn Woods and Kris to visit the Smile Train organization that helps children with clefts.\n\nWater sign: Kris, Caitlyn Jenner and Kendall Jenner are all water sign Scorpios and fire sign Kylie said 'it's always them against me'\n\nFire sign: Kylie was born under the fire sign Leo unlike her parents and sister Kendall\n\nLip size: Kylie said she didn't feel 'desirable or pretty' after being told she had small lips\n\nKylie admitted to not having 'the best confidence' when she was younger and her first kiss experience in part prompted her support for Smile Train since children with clefts deal with self-confidence issues on a 'whole other level'.\n\nKylie last year launched a special edition of her Kylie Cosmetics lip kits, donating 100 percent of sales from her Smile lipstick to Smile Train. They visited the Delgado Clinic in Lima where a baby girl named Mia was about to undergo surgery to fix a cleft.\n\n'I can't even imagine what Mia's mom is feeling right now. I couldn't fathom having a baby going under and doing this surgery,' Kylie said.\n\nPhilanthropic mission: Kylie supports Smile Train and watched baby girl Mia undergo surgery to fix a cleft in Lima, Peru\n\nChildren's charity: The reality star last year launched a special lipstick called Smile with 100 percent of proceeds going to Smile Train\n\nKris cried while the surgery was underway as she and Kylie watched through a window.\n\n'This is changing her entire life,' Kris told Kylie about Mia's surgery. 'It makes you think twice about what our problems are, know what I mean?'\n\nKris told Kylie that she was worried about her and the 'real crazy pace' of the teenager's life.\n\nMaking a difference: Kylie has donated nearly half a million dollars to Smile Train and helped more than 1,800 children with clefts get new smiles\n\nCrazy pace: Kris told Kylie that she was worried about the 'crazy pace' of her daughter's life\n\n'It's hard to balance being a teenager and also running my business. I'm trying to laugh and make memories. I'm 19 and want to live for myself,' Kylie said.\n\nKris told her youngest daughter that she felt like she had it together when she was 19.\n\n'I wanna make mistakes. I want to make bad decisions and learn from them,' Kylie replied.\n\nTeenage mogul: Kylie talked about balancing being a teenager with running a business\n\nSeeking growth: The reality star admitted that she wanted to make mistakes to learn from them\n\n'You are remarkable, I'm so proud of you,' Kris told her.\n\n'I can't think of another 19-year-old who had their s*** together enough. You are the perfect spokesperson for your generation, an amazing role model. You really are,' Kris told her.\n\nKris and Kylie the next day visited Mia after her surgery.\n\nProud mom: Kris told Kylie that she was a 'perfect spokesperson for [her] generation'\n\nLife-changer: The caring duo of Kylie and Kris later visited Mia after her surgery\n\n'She looks perfect. I love Mia. Are you going to remember me?,' Kylie said to the girl.\n\nKylie earlier in the episode ditched Kris at a fancy Michelin-ranked restaurant after she found the menu lacking.\n\nAfer tasting potato cooked in ashes, Kylie said, 'I feel like I'm eating the earth.\n\nNew smile: Kylie told Mia that she looked perfect after her surgery to remove a cleft\n\nShe also demurred when offered crispy fish scales and cheese with alpaca's heart.\n\n'That food is not for me, that's all I'm gonna say,' Kylie said during a confessional.\n\nKylie tried to leave early, but Kris shut it down.\n\nFancy dinner: Kris was all dressed up for a fancy dinner in Peru, but Kylie and best friend Jordyn Woods not so much\n\nReal hungry: Kylie wasn't feeling the fancy dinner and wanted spaghetti after only eating chips and guacamole on the plane\n\n'We can't leave right now. Play ball, kid,' Kris told her.\n\nKylie and Jordyn then pretended to go to the restroom, but instead jumped in a vehicle and left the restaurant.\n\n'Oh, I guess she just walked outside,' Kris remarked after hearing the fan frenzy outdoors.\n\nThe season finale of Life Of Kylie will air next week on the E! Network.\n\nBailing out: The reality star turned to her best friend as they planned their escape"}

That celebrity is Aubrey O\u2019Day who used to be in the singing group, Danity Kane. She has since made headlines for reportedly having an affair with Donald Trump Jr. while he was married after meeting him on Celebrity Apprentice. So what was her relationship like with Paul DelVecchio and did their relationship end on bad terms? Here is everything you need to know.\n\nPauly D and Aubrey O\u2019Day met on Famously Single\n\nIt only makes sense that the two reality stars met on a dating reality show. The two met in the show\u2019s first season and got pretty serious. There were rumors that they were engaged by the end of the show because O\u2019Day was seen wearing an engagement ring, but it was just a prank. The two still had a good time falling in love on the show.\n\n\u201cThe show is about all of us coming together,\u201d explained O\u2019Day according to E! News \u201cdating, learning through a dating coach how to go out there and approach people that are better suited for us and kind of get over the issues that we were having. And it ended up just like becoming like this chemistry happened within the house with a few of the cast-mates and Pauly and I were one of them.\u201d\n\nHe admitted this was his first relationship\n\nThe DJ opened up about learning from dating the singer. \u201cI\u2019ve learned so much,\u201d he told E! News. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty crazy because it was my first real relationship. I\u2019ve learned so much being in it \u2014 I\u2019ve learned don\u2019t assume anything. If you have a problem with your partner, don\u2019t assume. Just ask them and tell them how you feel, because most of the time it\u2019s not really what you think.\u201d\n\nThe two reportedly broke up in 2016\n\nThe first round of their relationship lasted less than a year. According to ET, the two broke up in the summer of 2016. But they then reunited and tried to make it work on reality tv.\n\nO\u2019Day said she tried Marriage Boot Camp a second time because she wanted a fresh perspective\n\nO\u2019Day previously was on Marriage Boot Camp with ex-boyfriend Travis Garland in Season 5. The reality show didn\u2019t work for them the first time so why did she go back to work on things with DelVecchio?\n\nThe singer told HollywoodLife, \u201cI was feeling suffocated, and losing my identity, and I was really hoping for a new environment, to get some fresh perspective.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t know about her reported affair with Donald Trump Jr.\n\nThe Jersey Shore star was asked if her alleged previous affair with Donald Trump Jr. would be mentioned on Marriage Boot Camp. \u201cWe didn\u2019t address that at all. Yeah, I didn\u2019t know anything about that,\u201d he told Us Weekly. \u201cI guess [the news broke] after or something like that.\u201d\n\nThe two officially split in July 2017 reportedly because the DJ didn\u2019t want to get married\n\nThe couple officially called it quits and it was reportedly DelVecchio who ended things. \u201cAubrey was pressing Pauly for an engagement ring,\u201d a source told ET. \u201cPauly did not see marriage with Aubrey in his future.\u201d\n\nThe couple did previously talk about marriage. She told E! News, \u201cI want a ring like ASAP!\u201d He also said, \u201cShe\u2019s the one for me, so I\u2019m looking forward to the next steps and waiting for the right moment to make all that happen.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Day said \u2018it\u2019s disappointing\u2019 that the DJ has said unkind things about her\n\nNow that their relationship is over the two have talked about each other. But the singer hasn\u2019t been happy about everything her ex-boyfriend has said. \u201cLately, I\u2019ve seen some Google alerts pop up about some unkind things that he said about me, which is disappointing \u2019cause I thought he was a bigger person than that,\u201d she told Page Six. \u201cMy mistake!\u201d\n\nShe claimed there were rules in their relationship\n\nThe singer also described their relationship as being unhealthy. \u201cThere was no healthy dialogue,\u201d she told Us Weekly. \u201cThere was no progressive communication.

{"label": true, "txt": "Wisconsin is known for cheeses that get better with time, and, on The Bachelor franchise it's known for men who do the same. (Nick Viall anyone?) This season, Peter Kraus is a clear fan favorite on The Bachelorette. If social media is any indication of popularity, Peter has won the hearts of Bachelor Nation members everywhere. But, though Peter's been a frontrunner on Rachel's season since the beginning, this competition is tough. There is a chance he doesn't end up engaged to her at the end of all this. But, if that happens, all hope isn't lost. There are so many signs that Peter could be the next Bachelor.\n\nProducers love to keep fans guessing as to who the next lead is, pretty much right up until the show starts filming. Sometimes production pulls a fast one and fans end up with a surprising choice like controversial Bachelor Nick Viall. However, most recent seasons have seen The Bachelorette fan favorite become the next leading man. (Ben Higgins and Sean Lowe are great examples of this.)\n\nShow creator Mike Fleiss recently asked fans on Twitter who they want to see as the next Bachelor. Many came forward to vote for Peter. Of course, Peter could end up engaged to Rachel, or start dating someone off the show, or even be deemed not right for the role. Still, many clues point to Peter as the next Bachelor.\n\nHe's A Fan Favorite\n\nFor everyone from former Bachelor contestants to regular ole' Bachelor watchers, Peter is clearly on everyone's radar. Many of the live tweets during The Bachelorette are about how perfect Peter is. When he's on the screen, he receives a sea of supportive tweets and GIFs. While this doesn't automatically make him the next Bachelor, it certainly helps his campaign. The show wants a Bachelor who fans are excited about, someone people will root for. And, at the moment, everyone seems to be rooting for Peter.\n\nHe's Got Those Bachelor Looks\n\nI'm pretty sure abs are a requirement for being the Bachelor. Creepy shower b-roll shots are a must for any Bachelor season and abs make those shots so much better. The Bachelor needs to be able to make ladies swoon, fight with each other, and act a bit kooky for television. I'm pretty certain Peter has the ability to do just that. With a sculpted body, a chiseled face, and an adorable gap between the teeth, Peter certainly qualifies as good looking.\n\nHe's Into Wholesome Family Fun\n\nDespite being filled with steamy hot tub makeout sessions, The Bachelor airs at 8 p.m. on ABC and is family prime time viewing. So, it's no wonder that Sean Lowe was an overwhelmingly popular Bachelor, being both family oriented and down to earth. Peter is a good ole' Wisconsin boy, an involved uncle, and pretty digestible for a Bachelor Nation audience.\n\nHe's Age Appropriate\n\nThere are many things about The Bachelor that are difficult to buy into. Folks who have known each other for only a few weeks are expected to consider an engagement. While I understand you form a connection quickly, committing to spend forever takes time. It's even harder to believe a guy in his mid-twenties is about to jump into that kind of commitment after only a few months. Peter is 31, a much more believable age of a man who wants to tie the knot and start a family.\n\nHe's Seems Genuine About Finding Love\n\nPeter has been open about his hesitations on The Bachelorette. The process is fast and he won't propose unless he's ready to. This honesty is refreshing in a show that often leads to engaged couples who split not long after. Peter's honesty makes his desire to find love somehow feel more genuine. He's looking for the one and isn't going to proclaim he's in love unless he really is. A genuine lead is always preferable over a performative one.\n\nHe Has An Established Life\n\nPeter had a modeling career. He now owns and works for Worth Personal Training, a personal training and bootcamp facility. Peter isn't banking his career on making money selling tea on Instagram. He's an established business owner and has a life set up in Wisconsin. Part of why Rachel has been such a wonderful Bachelorette is that she has a fulfilling career and life outside the show. It makes her a more dynamic lead to watch \u2014 and she seems more sure of herself and the decisions she's making.\n\nIt's His Destiny\n\nAs Peter revealed on Instagram, in his high school yearbook he predicted that he would be on The Bachelor. While high school Peter had a funky goatee and an interesting fashion sense, he was also clearly a fortune teller. His life was leading to roses and televised love since he was 17.\n\nIf Rachel and Peter don't end up sporting Neil Lane bling, there is a high chance that Peter will be the next Bachelor.

{"label": true, "txt": "Eva Longoria has been a new mom for almost two months, and she says she's having a tough time going back to work after her maternity leave.\n\nThe actress sat down with ET's Brooke Anderson on Saturday to discuss her new romantic comedy, Dog Days, and then on again on Sunday for the premiere at the Westfield mall in Century City, California, and she dished on what it was like to be a working mom for the first time.\n\n\"You know what, it's been [seven] weeks, he's seven weeks old, and I've been with him day and night, not working for seven weeks and it's been the best seven weeks of my life,\" she gushed at the junket. \"I just miss him so much.\"\n\nSaturday was the first time she'd gotten ready for the press since she and her husband, Jose \"Pepe\" Baston, welcomed their adorable baby boy, Santiago, on June 19, and she felt that her baby boy noticed a change.\n\n\"[Today was] the first time I've had hair and makeup in seven weeks and I was breastfeeding him this morning and I think he was like, 'Who are you? Where's my mom?'\" Longoria joked.\n\nThe proud mom couldn't help but gush over her precious progeny, marveling, \"He's a dream, and he's such a good baby. I knock on wood. He's just been so easy, so sweet, we've been really lucky, he's super healthy. It's just been great.\"\n\nHowever, she also acknowledged that the transition back to her life and career in show business is going to be difficult in a lot of new ways.\n\n\"So now comes the part where, as I start returning back to work slowly, [I'm asking], 'How do you balance it all?'\" She said. \"Everybody used to [ask] me, 'How do you do it all? You do so many things? And I was just like, 'Because I don't have kids.' I mean every project was my baby and now I actually have a baby.\"\n\nHowever, the nuances of motherhood aren't something she's found herself struggling with. For Longoria, becoming a mother was something she'd been preparing herself for over the years.\n\n\"When people go, 'Your mother instincts kick in,' that's true. I mean you become a natural,\" Longoria said. \"But I've been a mom to so many in my life already. My nieces, my nephews, girls through my foundation. I'm very well educated in this arena. I mean. I made sure I was, I took every class you could take, I read all the books I watched all the videos, and I still continued to learn.\"\n\nAs ready as she could be, however, there were still a few things she had difficulty with -- including Santiago's nursery.\n\nSpeaking with ET at the premiere on Sunday, Longoria admitted that she and her husband got her son's room ready at the \"last minute.\"\n\n\"We had moved, and so the nursery was like the last thing to put together,\" she said. \"I think we finally got it together like three days before he was born, so it was a super tight deadline.\"\n\nAt the premiere, Longoria also reflected on her second day of work in a row, and how much more challenging it's been than she knew.\n\n\"It's been so hard to leave him,\" Longoria shared. \"I kind of had to ease back into work. I've been with him 24 hours a day since he was born, so to leave him for [even] four hours is crazy.\"\n\nIn her upcoming comedy, Dog Days, Longoria plays a woman who is gearing up to become a mom via adoption. It was an experience that Longoria said she related to in a very specific way because she'd just discovered she was expecting in real life when production began.\n\n\"When I was filming this movie I was pregnant. I just found out I was pregnant. And I was so tired,' Longoria recalled. \"So playing a mom [while] I was actually making a baby was interesting and fun.\"\n\n\"Now as I watch the movie that I was pregnant in it, it was just so special,\" she added. \"Nobody knew. And, like, my jeans wouldn\u2019t button and I was like, 'I hope the camera doesn\u2019t see this.'\"\n\nNow that she's welcomed her beloved baby boy, Longoria cannot help but marvel over all his little habits and heartwarming quirks as he grows and develops in his early months.\n\n\"Everything he does is cute,\" she said. \"His noises he makes, his smile. He's finding his voice, so he makes all these funny [baby noises], you're just like, 'What was that?' He talks a lot. I mean, he just wants to talk and talk.\"\n\nThe one thing she can't wrap her head around is just how quickly he's growing up (even though he's not even two months old just yet).\n\n\"What's amazing is seeing him grow so much from just your breast milk. And I'm like, 'This is crazy! All you're eating is what's coming out of my body and you're just like doubled in size,'\" she shared. \"And it's going way too fast already. I'm like, 'Stop growing!' He's gonna be like 18 and have a job soon.\"\n\nWhile it's clear that Longoria has embraced motherhood with open arms and is adept at navigating the difficulties of having a baby and working in show business, she hasn't put any thought yet in whether or not she and her husband are interested in expanding their family even more.\n\nWhen asked if she would want to have another baby in the future, Longoria brushes off the idea. \"Oh gosh, you know what? Let me recover from this one and I'll let you know,\" she said, adding that it's \"too soon to tell.\"\n\nLongoria's latest comedy, Dog Days, hits theaters Aug. 8.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nEva Longoria's Newborn Son Lands First Magazine Cover With His Glowing Mom\n\nEva Longoria Enjoys 'Morning Cuddles' With Her Newborn Son\n\nEva Longoria Gives Birth to Baby Boy: Find Out His Name and See the First Pic!\n\nRelated Gallery"}

{"label": true, "txt": "Emily Blunt plays the magical nanny in the film directed by 'Chicago's' Rob Marshall.\n\nFifty-four years after Disney's Mary Poppins bowed on the big screen, the \"practically perfect\" nanny is gliding back into theaters.\n\nDisney first announced plans for a sequel to the live-action/animated classic in 2015, with Rob Marshall (Chicago, Into the Woods) attached to direct. Emily Blunt and Hamilton creator Lin-Manuel Miranda joined the project in February 2016. Over the next few months, the rest of the sequel's star-studded cast took shape \u2014 Meryl Streep, Angela Lansbury, Colin Firth and original Mary Poppins star Dick Van Dyke are all set to appear in the film.\n\nMarshall and Blunt screened the first footage from Mary Poppins Returns for a crowd of Disney fans at last year's D23. And the first teaser trailer aired during this year's Oscars. A full trailer dropped Sept. 17, followed by a \"Special Look\" on Oct. 23.\n\nSet 25 years after the original, Mary Poppins Returns follows the Banks family \u2014 Michael; his sister, Jane; and his children, Annabel, John and Georgie \u2014 as they deal with the sudden death of Michael's wife. Poppins pays a visit to the grieving family and uses her special brand of whimsy to console them while also helping prevent the greedy Fidelity Fiduciary Bank from taking possession of their house.\n\nWith the film's Dec. 19 release just around the corner, here's everything you need to know about the sequel to Disney's 1964 masterpiece:\n\nWHO\n\nEmily Blunt: Plays Mary Poppins, the elegant English nanny who uses magic to teach life lessons to her employers and their children. The actress, who previously worked with director Rob Marshall on 2014's Into the Woods, was the top choice to play Poppins. During the panel for Mary Poppins Returns at D23, Blunt indicated her take on Poppins will look a bit different than Julie Andrews' iconic portrayal. \"I just had to do my version of her,\" she explained. \"We were loyal to the books. I think she's a little more acerbic and vain and weird in the books and we went that direction a little more.\"\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda: Plays Jack, a lamplighter who joins Poppins and the Banks children on their adventures. Miranda's character has been described as a spiritual successor to Bert (Dick Van Dyke), Mary Poppins' companion in the original movie. To avoid replicating Van Dyke's much maligned cockney accent, Miranda worked extensively with a dialect coach on set.\n\nBen Whishaw: Plays Michael Banks, the adult version of the precocious young child Mary Poppins looked after in the first film. Whishaw is no stranger to heartwarming family films, having previously voiced the eponymous marmalade-loving bear in Paddington and Paddington 2.\n\nEmily Mortimer: Plays Jane Banks, Michael's sister. Following in the footsteps of her activist mother, Jane has become the union organizer for SPRUCE, the Society for the Protection of the Rights of the Underpaid Citizens of England.\n\nPixie Davies: Plays Annabel Banks, Michael's daughter. Not much is currently known about Annabel or the other Banks children, except for the fact that the three of them will be tended to by Poppins. Davies previously starred in Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children and the British TV series Humans.\n\nNathanael Saleh: Plays John Banks, Michael's older son. Saleh appeared on Game of Thrones in 2016.\n\nJoel Dawson: Plays Georgie Banks, Michael's younger son. Mary Poppins Returns is Dawson's screen debut.\n\nColin Firth: Plays William Weatherall Wilkins, president of Fidelity Fiduciary Bank, where Michael's father used to work. Mary Poppins Returns is Firth's fifth film this year, joining The Happy Prince, The Mercy, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again and Kursk.\n\nDick Van Dyke: Plays Mr. Dawes Jr., the mean-spirited son of the old banker Van Dyke played in the first film (he also played jack-of-all-trades Bert). Age is just a number for the 92-year-old Van Dyke, who filmed a song-and-dance number for his cameo. In an interview with Good Morning America, Blunt called him \"a magical guy,\" adding, \"He's got a zest for life that is just infectious.\"\n\nMeryl Streep: Plays Topsy Turvy, Mary Poppins' eccentric Eastern European cousin. An amalgamation of two characters from Travers' books, Topsy lives in a repair shop that occasionally turns upside down.\n\nAngela Lansbury: Plays The Balloon Lady, a balloon saleswoman whom Poppins and the Banks children meet on an outing. Just as Miranda's Jack is intended to be a spiritual successor to Bert from the original film, Lansbury's character has been described as the sequel's version of the \"Bird Lady.\" Lansbury has had an impressive acting career spanning eight decades, but Disney fans may know her best as the voice of Mrs. Potts in 1991's Beauty and the Beast.\n\nDavid Warner: Plays Admiral Boom, a former naval officer and neighbor to the Banks who fires his cannon every 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. A noted character actor since the 1960s, Warner won an Emmy for his portrayal of Pomponius Falco in the 1981 miniseries Masada. He is also known for his regular appearances in the Star Trek franchise.\n\nJulie Walters: Plays Ellen, Michael's housekeeper. In the original film, Ellen was employed by Michael's parents. Walters was nominated for an Oscar for her performance in 2000's Billy Elliot. She also played Molly Weasley in the Harry Potter film series.\n\nJulie Andrews: The original Mary Poppins' appearance has not been confirmed, but she has given the new nanny her seal of approval. When questioned about Blunt in an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Andrews responded, \"I think she's terrific. And a perfect pick.\"\n\nWHAT\n\n1964's Mary Poppins starred Julie Andrews as the eponymous, charmingly mysterious nanny. When their babysitter abruptly quits, George and Winifred Banks (David Tomlinson and Glynis Johns) hire Poppins to take care of their two children, Michael (Matthew Garber) and Jane (Karen Dotrice). During her tenure with the Banks, Mary and her friend Bert (Dick Van Dyke) take the children on magical excursions that teach them manners and discipline. They also work their charms on the Banks' stern father, teaching him how to lower his guard and enjoy life with his children. At the end of the movie, Poppins says goodbye to the Banks and ascends into the clouds.\n\nTwenty-five years later in the films' chronology (54 years later in real time), Mary Poppins is coming back to 10 Cherry Lane. In Mary Poppins Returns, Poppins (Blunt) arrives to cheer up the Banks family after the sudden loss of Michael's wife. Joined by Jack (Miranda), a lamplighter who used to be Bert's apprentice, she takes the family on a new series of adventures.\n\nLike in the last film, the eponymous nanny will turn the mundane into the magical. Bath time with the Banks children becomes a deep-sea dive, an encounter with the Balloon Lady becomes a whimsical journey through the skies and a broken china bowl becomes the portal to a cartoon world.\n\nThat last bit of magic (dubbed the \"Royal Doulton China\" bowl sequence by the filmmakers) is an homage to the original film's groundbreaking blend of live action and animation. To mimic the look of the original film's live-action/animated sequence, Mary Poppins Returns director Rob Marshall decided to use traditional animation, a method that hasn't been used extensively by Disney in a feature film since 2011's Winnie the Pooh. \u201cEveryone agreed it felt fresh again,\" Marshall told Yahoo Movies. \"When you see them speaking to these animated characters that are drawn that way and you feel that artistry, you feel a sense of nostalgia.\"\n\nIn addition to mixing live action and animation, the original film features a beloved soundtrack, which includes such memorable songs as \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious,\" \"A Spoonful of Sugar,\" \"Chim Chim Cher-ee,\" \"Jolly Holiday\" and \"Step in Time.\" Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, the songwriting team behind Hairspray, have been dealt the task of writing new songs that live up to those. So far, fans have heard a snippet of the new song \"Can You Imagine That?\" in the Oct. 23 \"Special Look.\"\n\nWHEN\n\nThe film is set in 1935 London, 25 years after the original. Its events will unfold against the backdrop of the Great Depression.\n\nFilming began in February 2017 and wrapped in early June. Because of the film's complex visual effects, postproduction lasted a year.\n\nIt will be released on Dec. 19, 2018, 54 years and four months after the original. This will mark one of the largest gaps between the release of a film and its sequel in history. Other Disney movies that are in that ball park claim include 1940's Fantasia and 1999's Fantasia 2000 at 59 years and 1953's Peter Pan and 2002's Return to Neverland at 49 years.\n\nWHERE\n\nFilming took place at Surrey's famed Shepperton Studios, which has housed the productions of Lawrence of Arabia, Star Wars, Alien, Blade Runner, The Princess Bride, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and Marshall's own Into the Woods. Select scenes were also filmed on location in London.\n\nWHY\n\nP.L. Travers' eight-book Mary Poppins series spawned a multimedia franchise that includes the 1964 theatrical film; a 1983 Russian TV film; a 2006 Broadway musical; a 2010 BBC radio drama; and 2013's Saving Mr. Banks, a making-of biopic starring Emma Thompson as Travers and Tom Hanks as Walt Disney.\n\nOf all the adaptations of Travers' series, the 1964 film version of Mary Poppins is the best known and, arguably, the most beloved. Considered by some critics to be Walt Disney's magnum opus, the film has grossed more than $102 million at the domestic box office. It was nominated for 13 Oscars at the 37th Academy Awards and won five, including best actress for Andrews.\n\nIn 2006, the American Film Institute ranked Disney's Mary Poppins at No. 6 on its list of the greatest movie musicals. Today, it continues to be considered a classic family film.\n\nMarshall says he was drawn to Mary Poppins Returns because of the film's timely message. \u201cWhen Disney came to us with this, it was right at a point in the world where [producer] John DeLuca and myself were so desperate to do it ... in order to balance out the world in which we live in now,\" Marshall told Yahoo Movies. \"We have spent three years working on this film. To live in a world that has hope and escape and fantasy and truth and reality and emotion and all those other things, feels so important right now.\u201d\n\nTRAILERS"}

{"label": true, "txt": "Queen Elizabeth II and her family after Christmas Day service at St. Mary Magdalene Church at Sandringham, on Dec. 25, 2017. (Photo: ADRIAN DENNIS/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIt's Christmas again, the time of year when British royals generally step up their round of good work and cheery public appearances before disappearing to private celebrations, far from prying eyes. This year is no different.\n\nRoutine is built into royal life, especially for senior royals such as Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles the Prince of Wales, whose busy schedules are usually laid out for them months or years in advance.\n\nEach royal year has a certain rhythm: Easter at Windsor Castle, Trooping the Colour and Royal Ascot in June, the annual eight-week holiday at Balmoral in Scotland in late summer, Remembrance Day in November, and Christmas always at Sandringham House.\n\nSandringham:\n\nFor the past three decades, the queen has hosted her sprawling family at her private estate in Norfolk for the Christmas and New Year holidays. There they exchange cheap gag gifts and sit down to a black-tie Christmas dinner on Christmas Eve.\n\nOn Christmas morning, they have breakfast (the men go downstairs for a hearty \"fry up,\" the women have something light served in their rooms, according to former royal chef Darren McGrady), then gather before 11 a.m. local time to walk to services at nearby St. Mary Magdalene Church. They return for Christmas lunch and then gather around the TV to watch the queen's annual Christmas speech to the nation and the Commonwealth.\n\n(This is required watching for the family as it is the only speech the queen gets to write herself without involvement from the government of the day. It used to be broadcast from Sandringham, starting with her grandfather in 1936, but now she usually records it ahead of time.)\n\nA clutch of British royals, led by Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla Duchess of Cornwall, walk to attend a Christmas service in Sandringham, Dec. 25, 2016. (Photo: Kirsty Wigglesworth/ AP)\n\nWhy Christmas at Sandringham? It's a private country mansion, unlike Windsor Castle, some of which is open to the public. Unlike Windsor, it's about two hours away by train from London and the media, although there is always an organized photo shoot of the family walking to their little church, even Prince Philip, 97. But not the queen; she is usually driven to church.\n\nMost important, Sandringham is much-loved by the queen and her family, including her father and grandfather, both of whom died there.\n\nLast year, Prince Harry and his then-fiancee, Meghan Markle, were among the walkers \u2013an unprecedented honor for her since she had not yet officially joined the family, their May wedding still months away.\n\nSandringham estate is sprawling (20,000 acres) so it's suitable for the annual Boxing Day (Dec. 26) pheasant shoot that Philip used to be in charge of organizing, although now that he's finally retired from public life, he may have passed that task on to someone else.\n\nLast year, Harry skipped the shoot, reportedly to spare Meghan's animal-rights sympathies, and he may be absent again this year. Harry's mother, the late Princess Diana, also loathed blood sports but from boyhood on, her sons have joined in enthusiastically with their royal relations.\n\nPrince William and Duchess Kate and their children, baby Prince Louis, Princess Charlotte and Prince George, pose for their annual Christmas card at their country home, Anmer Hall, in Norfolk in the fall of 2018.

This year, when they are expecting their first child in the spring, they are going to be at Sandringham alongside Will and Kate, despite all the tabloid rumor-mongering about alleged tensions between the brothers and their wives.\n\nSometimes Will and Harry play in a charity soccer match on Christmas Eve, pitting Sandringham staff and estate neighbors.\n\nWill and Kate take Christmas cheer to military families:\n\nThe Cambridges went all the way to Cyprus to say Merry Christmas to Royal Air Force families. First, on Dec. 4, they hosted a holiday party at Kensington Palace for families whose loved ones are serving at a British base on the island.\n\nDuchess Kate of Cambridge meets children at Kensington Palace where she and Prince William hosted a Christmas party for families and children of Royal Air Force personnel serving on Cyprus, Dec. 4, 2018.

Every year in early December she hosts a children's lunch party at Clarence House in London where the kids help her decorate the palace Christmas tree.\n\n\u201cThe tree decorating for me is always the start of Christmas,\" she told reporters the day of the Dec. 6 party this year. \"I haven\u2019t thought about it before today, but I come in and see the tree and the children and everything and it just gets me in a Christmas mood.\"\n\nDuchess Camilla of Cornwall meets reindeer Dancer, left, and Blitzen, right, with their handlers Karen and Jason Perrins in the gardens at Clarence House in London, Dec. 6, 2018. (Photo: Kirsty Wigglesworth/AP)\n\nThis year, she took some of the kids outside to meet two reindeer, \"Dancer\" and \"Blitzen,\" and their handler elves, leading to cute pictures of them all feeding lichen to the not-so-tiny antlered critters.\n\nFor the past nine years, the kids and families invited to Camilla's party have been beneficiaries of the Helen & Douglas House hospice center and Roald Dahl's Marvellous Children's Charity, two organizations for which Camilla serves as patron. Every year the organizations help support thousands of children who suffer from chronic illnesses.\n\nThe queen's Christmas lunch:\n\nThe week before Christmas, the queen hosts a huge festive lunch for her extended family at Buckingham Palace, including those who will not be at Sandringham. This gives the monarch an opportunity to catch up with relatives she might not see regularly during the year.\n\nLast year, Meghan Markle was included, in another sign of how quickly she was accepted into the family ahead of the wedding. Tradition reportedly dictates that the lunch is attended by only relatives and spouses.\n\nOn Wednesday, Dec. 19, Meghan was photographed smiling next to Harry as the two drove onto the palace grounds for this year's luncheon. She sported large diamond studs and what appeared to be a top with a high collar.\n\nPrince Harry and Duchess Meghan arrive at the annual Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace in London on Dec. 19, 2018.

Photographers also captured Prince George peeking through the backseat.\n\nPrince William, Duchess Kate and their son Prince George arrive at the queen's Christmas lunch.

Their routine was interrupted (a rarity) in 2016 when, the day after the lunch, Buckingham Palace suddenly announced they had postponed their departure because the two had \"heavy colds.\" They were flown there by helicopter the next day.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II poses at her desk in the 1844 Room at Buckingham Palace, on Dec. 13, 2017, after recording her Christmas Day broadcast to the nation and the Commonwealth.

This year, Charles and Camilla posed on a garden bench at Clarence House, their London home. The Cambridges posed in the branches of a tree in the garden at Anmer Hall.\n\nAnd Harry and Meghan chose a previously unseen black and white photo of themselves watching the fireworks at Frogmore House after their second wedding reception to adorn their 2018 card.\n\nBut it's the card from the queen that counts. Every year, she and Prince Philip send around 750, usually featuring a family photo, to family, friends and members of the Royal Household staff, along with others such as British and Commonwealth prime ministers, governors-general and high commissioners.\n\nPrince Philip usually sends another 200 cards to different regiments and organizations with whom he's long been associated.\n\nThe Royal Christmas Gifts:\n\nAll members of the Royal Household receive presents from the queen, who personally hands them out to some members of her household staff at Buckingham Palace and at Windsor Castle.\n\nPrince Charles and Duchess Camilla pose on the grounds of Clarence House, London, for their 2018 Christmas card. (Photo: Hugo Burnand/Clarence House via AP)\n\nThe Royal Christmas Puddings:\n\nContinuing the tradition from her father, King George VI, and her grandfather, George V, the queen also gives out about 1,500 Christmas puddings to her staff in the palaces, in the Court Post Office and the palace police. Each pudding is accompanied by a greeting card from the queen and Prince Philip.\n\nAmericans are familiar with \"pudding\" as a custard treat. A British Christmas pudding, also known as a \"plum pudding\" or a \"figgy pudding,\" is nothing like that. It's a medieval soft cake-like dessert made of dried fruits held together by egg, suet, treacle or molasses, and flavored with spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves and ginger.\n\nThe Royal Christmas Trees:\n\nThe tradition of decorating trees at Christmas was popularized by British royals, specifically Queen Victoria and her German-born husband Prince Albert, both of whom had grown up with the custom. Her German ancestors introduced the idea to the English and her German mother continued it. By the 1860s it was a thing, with hundreds of trees being sold in Covent Garden.\n\nAs well as donating money to several charities in Windsor each Christmas, the queen also gives Christmas trees to Westminster Abbey, St. Paul's Cathedral, St. Giles' Cathedral and the Canongate Kirk in Edinburgh. Churches and schools in the Sandringham area will also receive a tree from Her Majesty.\n\nDecorated trees go up at the London palaces, and at Sandringham there's a large silver artificial tree in the dining room decorated by the grandchildren and great-grandchildren, according to former royal chef McGrady, who dished about the tradition in an interview with Good Housekeeping.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2018/12/19/royal-christmas-queen-harry-meghan-and-kate-celebrate-family-traditions/2281611002/"}

During the fourth season of Ellen in 1997, she came out as a lesbian in an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Her character, Ellen Morgan, also came out to a therapist played by Winfrey, and the series went on to explore various LGBT issues, including the coming-out process. In 2008, she married her longtime girlfriend Portia de Rossi.\n\nDeGeneres has hosted the Academy Awards, Grammy Awards, and the Primetime Emmys. She has authored four books and started her own record company, Eleveneleven, as well as a production company, A Very Good Production. She also launched a lifestyle brand, ED Ellen DeGeneres, which comprises a collection of apparel, accessories, home, baby, and pet items.[3] She has won 30 Emmys, 20 People's Choice Awards (more than any other person[4]), and numerous other awards for her work and charitable efforts. In 2016, she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[5]\n\nEarly life and education\n\nDeGeneres was born and raised in Metairie, Louisiana, to Elizabeth Jane (n\u00e9e Pfeffer, born May 20, 1930), a speech therapist, and Elliott Everett DeGeneres (c.1925-2018), an insurance agent.[6][1][7] She has one brother, Vance, a musician and producer. She is of French, English, German, and Irish descent. She was raised as a Christian Scientist.[8] In 1973, her parents filed for separation and were divorced the following year.[8] Shortly after, Ellen's mother married Roy Gruessendorf, a salesman. Betty Jane and Ellen moved with Gruessendorf from the New Orleans area to Atlanta, Texas. Vance stayed with his father. On a February 2011 episode of her show, she told her studio audience of a letter from the New England Historic Genealogical Society confirming she is 15th cousin to Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, via their shared common ancestor Thomas Fairfax.[9][10]\n\nDeGeneres graduated from Atlanta High School in May 1976, after completing her first years of high school at Grace King High School in Metairie, Louisiana. She moved back to New Orleans to attend the University of New Orleans, where she majored in communication studies. After one semester, she left school to do clerical work in a law firm with a cousin, Laura Gillen. Her early jobs included working at J. C. Penney,[11] and being a waitress at T.G.I. Friday's and another restaurant, a house painter, a hostess, and a bartender. She relates much of her childhood and career experiences in her comedic work.\n\nStand-up comedy\n\nDeGeneres started performing stand-up comedy at small clubs and coffee houses. By 1981, she was the emcee at Clyde's Comedy Club in New Orleans. DeGeneres cites Woody Allen and Steve Martin as her main influences at this time.[12] In the early 1980s she began to tour nationally, and in 1984 she was named Showtime's funniest person in America.[13]\n\nIn 2017, it was announced DeGeneres will appear in a brand new stand up special, Relatable, for Netflix after 15 years not performing stand-up comedy.[14][15]\n\nFilm career\n\nEllen DeGeneres at the Emmy Awards, September 1997\n\nEllen's work in the late 1980s and early 1990s included the film Coneheads. DeGeneres starred in a series of films for a show named Ellen's Energy Adventure, which is part of the Universe of Energy attraction and pavilion at Walt Disney World's Epcot. The film also featured Bill Nye, Alex Trebek, Michael Richards, and Jamie Lee Curtis. The show revolved around DeGeneres' falling asleep and finding herself in an energy-themed version of Jeopardy!, playing against an old rival, portrayed by Curtis, and Albert Einstein. The next film had DeGeneres co-hosting an educational look at energy with Nye. The ride first opened on September 15, 1996, as Ellen's Energy Crisis, but was quickly given the more positive-sounding name Ellen's Energy Adventure.\n\nTelevision career\n\nDeGeneres' first regular TV role was in a short-lived Fox sitcom called Open House. She played the role of Margo Van Meter, an office worker at the Juan Verde Real Estate company. The show co-starred Alison LaPlaca and Mary Page Keller. In 1992, producers Neal Marlens and Carol Black cast DeGeneres in their sitcom Laurie Hill, in the role of Nurse Nancy MacIntyre. The series was canceled after only four episodes, but Marlens and Black were so impressed with DeGeneres' performance that they soon cast her in their next ABC pilot, These Friends of Mine, which they co-created with David S. Rosenthal.\n\nAt the Governor's Ball after the 46th Annual Emmy Awards telecast, September 1994\n\nDeGeneres' comedy career became the basis of the successful sitcom Ellen, named These Friends of Mine during its first season. The ABC show was popular in its first few seasons due in part to DeGeneres' style of observational humor; it was often referred to as a \"female Seinfeld.\"[16]\n\nEllen reached its height of popularity in April 1997, when DeGeneres came out as a lesbian on The Oprah Winfrey Show. Her character on the sitcom also came out of the closet to her therapist, played by Oprah Winfrey.[17] The coming-out episode, titled \"The Puppy Episode\", was one of the highest-rated episodes of the show. The series returned for a fifth season but experienced falling ratings due to ABC's cutting back on promoting the show.[citation needed] It was believed that The Walt Disney Company, ABC's parent owner, had become uncomfortable with the subject matter depicted on the show now that DeGeneres' character was openly gay.[citation needed] In May 1998, Ellen was canceled. DeGeneres returned to stand-up comedy and later re-established herself as a successful talk show host.\n\nDeGeneres returned to television in 2001 with a new CBS sitcom, The Ellen Show. DeGeneres launched a daytime television talk show, The Ellen DeGeneres Show, in September 2003. One of several celebrity-hosted talk shows surfacing at the beginning of that season, including those of Sharon Osbourne and Rita Rudner, her show has consistently risen in the Nielsen ratings and received widespread critical praise. It was nominated for 11 Daytime Emmy Awards in its first season, winning four, including Best Talk Show. The show has won 25 Emmy Awards for its first three seasons on the air. DeGeneres is known for her dancing and singing with the audience at the beginning of the show and during commercial breaks. She often gives away free prizes and trips to be in her show's studio audience with the help of her sponsors.\n\nDeGeneres celebrated her thirty-year class reunion by flying her graduating class to California to be guests on her show in February 2006. She presented Atlanta High School with a surprise gift of a new electronic LED marquee sign. In May 2006, DeGeneres made a surprise appearance at the Tulane University commencement in New Orleans. Following George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton to the podium, she came out in a bathrobe and furry slippers. \"They told me everyone would be wearing robes,\" she said. Ellen then went on to make another commencement speech at Tulane in 2009.[18]\n\nThe show broadcast for a week from Universal Studios Orlando in March 2007. Skits included DeGeneres going on the Hulk Roller Coaster Ride[19] and the Jaws Boat Ride.[20] In May 2007, DeGeneres was placed on bed rest due to a torn ligament in her back. She continued hosting her show from a hospital bed, tended to by a nurse, explaining \"the show must go on, as they say.\" Guests sat in hospital beds as well.[21] On May 1, 2009, DeGeneres celebrated her 1000th episode, featuring celebrity guests such as Oprah Winfrey, Justin Timberlake, and Paris Hilton, among others.[22] Jennifer Aniston and Justin Timberlake surprised DeGeneres on her 2,000th show in December 2015.[23]\n\nOn September 9, 2009, it was confirmed that DeGeneres would replace Paula Abdul as a judge of the ninth season of American Idol. Her role started after the contestant auditions, at the beginning of \"Hollywood Week\".[24][25] It is reported that DeGeneres also signed a contract to be a judge on the show for at least five seasons.[26] She made her American Idol debut on February 9, 2010. However, on July 29, 2010, DeGeneres and Fox executives announced that the comedian would be leaving American Idol after one season. In a statement, DeGeneres said that the series \"didn't feel like the right fit for me\".[27]\n\nStarting in the 2017-2018 television season DeGeneres began hosting the game show Ellen's Game of Games on NBC which is based, and expands on games played on her talk show. The series had a preview episode on December 18, 2017 with regular episodes beginning the following January.[28]\n\nAward shows\n\nDeGeneres received wide exposure on November 4, 2001, when she hosted the televised broadcast of the Emmy Awards. Presented after two cancellations due to network concerns that a lavish ceremony following the September 11 attacks would appear insensitive, the show required a more somber tone that would also allow viewers to temporarily forget the tragedy. DeGeneres received several standing ovations for her performance that evening, which included the line: \"What would bug the Taliban more than seeing a gay woman in a suit surrounded by Jews?\"[29]\n\nIn August 2005, DeGeneres hosted the 2005 Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony held on September 18, 2005. This was three weeks after Hurricane Katrina, making it the second time she hosted the Emmys following a national tragedy. She also hosted the Grammy Awards in 1996 and in 1997.\n\nOn September 7, 2006, DeGeneres was selected to host the 79th Academy Awards ceremony, which took place on February 25, 2007.[30] This makes her the first openly gay person to have hosted the event.[31] During the Awards show, DeGeneres said, \"What a wonderful night, such diversity in the room, in a year when there's been so many negative things said about people's race, religion, and sexual orientation. And I want to put this out there: If there weren't blacks, Jews and gays, there would be no Oscars, or anyone named Oscar, when you think about that.\"[32] Reviews of her hosting gig were positive, with one saying, \"DeGeneres rocked, as she never forgot that she wasn't just there to entertain the Oscar nominees but also to tickle the audience at home.\"[33] Regis Philbin said in an interview that \"the only complaint was there's not enough Ellen.\"\n\nDeGeneres was nominated for an Emmy Award as host of the Academy Awards broadcast.[34] On August 2, 2013, it was announced that DeGeneres would host the Academy Awards on March 2, 2014, for the second time.[35]\n\nA selfie orchestrated by 86th Academy Awards host Ellen DeGeneres during the broadcast is the second-most retweeted tweet ever.[36][37] DeGeneres said she wanted to homage Meryl Streep's record 17 Oscar nominations by setting a new record with her, and invited other Oscar celebrities to join them. The resulting photo of twelve celebrities broke the previous retweet record within forty minutes and was retweeted over 1.8 million times in the first hour.[38][39][40] By the end of the ceremony it had been retweeted over 2 million times, less than 24 hours later, it had been retweeted over 2.8 million times.[37][38] As of May 2017 , it has been retweeted over 3.4 million times.[37] The group selfie effort was parodied by Lego and Matt Groening with The Simpsons.[41][42] It beat the previous record, which was held by Barack Obama, following his victory in the 2012 presidential election.[40][43][44]\n\nOther ventures\n\nED Ellen DeGeneres\n\nEllen launched her lifestyle brand under the name ED by Ellen in the summer of 2015.[45] After her initial collections, the brand name then changed to ED Ellen DeGeneres to incorporate the licensed arm of her brand.[46] The collection includes apparel, shoes, accessories, pet, baby and home items. DeGeneres' dog collection at PetSmart was launched in February 2017,[47] and a cat line was introduced later that year.[48]\n\nIn November 2017, the brand launched a collection to benefit Ellen's #BeKindToElephants campaign featuring a tee and baby one piece, donating 100% of the proceeds to the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust.[49] Then, DeGeneres created a line with her brand to benefit the newly created Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund,[50] a member of the Digit Fund, to launch a line of tees and footwear to help gorillas.[51]\n\nVoice acting\n\nDeGeneres lent her voice to the role of Dory, a friendly fish with short-term memory loss, in the 2003 animated Disney/Pixar film Finding Nemo.[52] The film's director, Andrew Stanton, said that he chose Ellen because she changed the subject five times before one sentence had finished on her show.[53] For her performance as Dory, DeGeneres won the Saturn Award from the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films for Best Supporting Actress; Favorite Voice from an Animated Movie from the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards; and the Annie Award from the International Animated Film Association, for Outstanding Voice Acting. She was also nominated for a Chicago Film Critics Association Award in the Best Supporting Actress category. She also provided the voice of the dog in the prologue of the Eddie Murphy feature film Dr. Dolittle. Her win of the Saturn Award marked the first and only time the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films has given the acting award for a voice performance.\n\nShe reprised the role of Dory from Finding Nemo in the 2016 sequel, Finding Dory.\n\nCommercial spokesperson\n\nIn November 2004, DeGeneres appeared, dancing, in an ad campaign for American Express. Her most recent American Express commercial, a two-minute black-and-white spot in which she works with animals, debuted in November 2006 and was created by Ogilvy & Mather. In 2007, the commercial won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Commercial.\n\nDeGeneres began working with CoverGirl Cosmetics in September 2008, for which she has been criticized, as her animal-friendly values clash with Procter and Gamble's (the maker of CoverGirl Cosmetics) animal testing.[54] Her face became the focus of CoverGirl advertisements starting in January 2009. The beauty campaign was DeGeneres' first.[55]\n\nOn December 3, 2011, DeGeneres headlined the third annual \"Change Begins Within\" gala for the David Lynch Foundation held at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.[56][57]\n\nIn spring 2012, DeGeneres became the spokesperson for J. C. Penney in a tour and advertising campaign.[11]\n\nDeGeneres represents a line of products on QVC, a home shopping network. Her line of home products, initialized as E.D., for Ellen DeGeneres, began being offered on QVC on October 24, 2014, under the name E.D. on Air.[58]\n\nOn September 4, 2018, TCL, announces it's extension as the Official TV of The Ellen DeGeneres Show for a fifth consecutive season.[59]\n\nEleveneleven\n\nOn May 26, 2010, DeGeneres announced on her show that she was starting her own record label entitled \"eleveneleven\". She explained her choice of name, claiming that she often sees the number 11:11 when looking at her clocks, that she found Greyson on the 11th, and that the singer's soccer jersey has the number 11.[60] She mentioned that she had been looking for videos of performances on YouTube to start her label. The first act she signed to the label is Greyson Chance.[61]\n\nInfluences\n\nDeGeneres lists among her comedic influences Woody Allen, Lucille Ball, Carol Burnett, Steve Martin, and Bob Newhart.[62]\n\nPersonal life\n\nForbes estimated DeGeneres' 2018 earnings at US$87.5 million,[63] making her the 15th highest-paid entertainer in the world.[64] In 2015, she was named the 50th most powerful woman in the world by Forbes[65] and number two on the World Pride Power list.[66] As of August 2, 2018, DeGeneres has more than 76 million followers on Twitter and 55.8 million followers on Instagram, making her the seventh most followed user on Twitter and the 28th most followed user on Instagram.\n\nShe is a fan of the National Football League and has shown particular support for the New Orleans Saints and the Green Bay Packers.[67][68] In 2011, she attended a Saints practice dressed as Packers Hall of Famer Don Hutson.[69]\n\nSexual orientation and relationships\n\nPortia de Rossi and DeGeneres in September 2012\n\nIn 1997, DeGeneres came out as lesbian. The disclosure of her sexual orientation sparked intense interest by American tabloids.[70] The contentiousness of the media coverage stunted DeGeneres' professional career and left her \"mired in depression\".[70] In her book Love, Ellen, DeGeneres' mother, Betty DeGeneres describes being initially shocked when her daughter came out, but she has since become one of her strongest supporters; she is also an active member of Parents & Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) and spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign's Coming Out Project.\n\nThe same year she came out, DeGeneres started a romantic relationship with actress Anne Heche that lasted until August 2000.[71] From 2000 to 2004, DeGeneres maintained a close affair with actress/director/photographer Alexandra Hedison.[72] The couple appeared on the cover of The Advocate after their separation had already been announced to the media.[73]\n\nSince 2004, DeGeneres has had a relationship with Portia de Rossi.[74] After the overturn of the same-sex marriage ban in California, DeGeneres and de Rossi were engaged, and married in August 2008, at their home in Beverly Hills, California, where they live with their four dogs and three cats.[75][76] The passage of Proposition 8 cast doubt on the legal status of their marriage, but a subsequent California Supreme Court judgment validated it because it occurred before November 4, 2008.[77][78][79] On August 6, 2010, de Rossi filed a petition to legally change her name to Portia Lee James DeGeneres.[80] The petition was granted on September 23, 2010.[81]\n\nAnimal rights and veganism\n\nEllen previously described herself as a vegan and \"big animal lover\".[82][83] De Rossi, too, is a vegan.[83] Ellen co-ordinated a vegan outreach website titled 'Going Vegan with Ellen'.[84] She intended to open a vegan tapas bar, Bokado, in Los Angeles, but plans fell through.[85]\n\nThe site for The Ellen DeGeneres Show contains a section called \"Going Vegan With Ellen\", in which she promotes \"Meatless Mondays\" and features vegan recipes.[86] She has several times invited Humane Society of the United States CEO Wayne Pacelle to speak on her show about the organization's efforts in animal protection legislation. In 2009, PETA named her their \"Woman of the Year.\"[87] In April 2013, she donated $25,000 to stop Ag-Gag anti-whistleblower legislation in Tennessee, which would prohibit undercover investigators from recording footage of animal abuse on farms.[88]\n\nDeGeneres served as campaign ambassador to Farm Sanctuary's Adopt-A-Turkey Project in 2010, asking people to start \"a new tradition by adopting a turkey instead of eating one\" at Thanksgiving.[89]\n\nHumanitarianism\n\nIn November 2011, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton named her a special envoy for Global AIDS Awareness.[90] On December 3, 2011, DeGeneres opened the show at the David Lynch Foundation's 3rd annual \"Change Begins Within\" gala at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art to raise funds to bring Transcendental Meditation to at-risk populations suffering from epidemic levels of chronic stress and stress-related disorders. She says: \"TM is the only time I have that stillness\u2026 it gives me this peaceful feeling, and I love it so much. I can\u2019t say enough good things about it. All the benefits that you can achieve from sitting still and going within\u2014it really is a beautiful experience. David Lynch is such a wonderful man to start this foundation to help people.\"[91][92]\n\nIn November 2017, it was announced that President Donald Trump would begin allowing the importation of elephant trophies from Africa. DeGeneres, an animal activist, created a hashtag campaign in partnership with her brand, ED Ellen DeGeneres, to donate to the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust. DeGeneres also created a T-shirt with her brand whose proceeds also go to the organization.[93]\n\nIn January 2018, for Ellen's 60th birthday, Ellen's wife, Portia de Rossi, gifted Ellen a permanent gorilla home in Rwanda built in her namesake for the Digit Fund.[94] This gift was part of a new arm of the Digit Fund now called the \"Ellen DeGeneres Wildlife Fund.\"[95]\n\nFilmography\n\nFilm\n\nTelevision\n\nAs executive producer\n\nMusic videos\n\nVideo games\n\nDiscography\n\nAlbums\n\nYear Title Formats 1996 Taste This Enhanced CD/Download\n\nAudiobooks\n\nYear Title Formats 2003 The Funny Thing Is...

In fact, Miley Cyrus is full on embracing her Hannah Montana days. Everyone, of course, is obsessed with this new era, but none of us will ever forget how she got her big break and neither will she, which she gushed about on The Howard Stern Show.\n\n\"They cast someone, besides me, first. And they even did a pilot without me and then they said it didn\u2019t work,\" Miley said. \"I love that I was f\u2014ing Hannah Montana. That\u2019s what the song 'Younger Now' on my album is about. It says, 'Even though it\u2019s not who I am, I\u2019m not afraid of who I used to be.'\"\n\nMiley also spoke on [CBS Sunday Morning](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5029947/Miley-Cyrus-says-Hannah-Montana-lot-kid.html?ito=social-twitterdailymailceleb)_ about why she thinks everyone loved the character Hannah Montana. \"I think why people loved [it] was because Hannah Montana did feel real, and that's because I was under there. And people forgot that sometimes. I loved being that character and that's what made people love her\u2026That was great music for kids to listen to. There's a song called Life's What You Make it, so Let's Make it Rock. Never forget that \u2013 wise words. That's a good thing to tell kids.\"\n\nHowever, living this sort of double life wasn't always easy. Miley said,\"It's a lot to put on a kid to have them have get their make-up done and then also balance school\u2026It got harder when I started touring as both \u2013 I toured as Hannah Montana and as myself. I think that's probably what's a little bit wrong with me now! I mark that up to doing some extreme damage in my psyche as an adult person.\"\n\nThere were subtle hints to her past in the in the \"Younger Now\" music video that fans picked up on, and as the singer recently told MTV News, none of them were actually intentional funny enough.\n\n\"Even though I wasn't intentionally trying to reenact something I had already done, it just naturally happened, because that's a part of me too,\" Miley said. One other thing fans have picked up on from the \"Younger Now\" new video is the similarities to Hannah Montana: The Movie\u2019s beloved \"Hoedown Throwdown.\" Especially in the group dance sequence, and of course social media couldn't help but make note of it.\n\n13.

I am stoked that that was a part of my life,\u201d she continued to MTV. \"I'm not afraid of who I used to be. No one stays the same.\"\n\nThis is a bit of a different tune than the one she was singing a few months ago when talking about how embarrassed she was of her \u201cWrecking Ball\u201d music video.

{"label": true, "txt": "WWE is about to get even more \"Rowdy.\"\n\nRonda Rousey made her WWE debut late Sunday night to close the 2018 Royal Rumble, and it was announced just moments after the show went off the air that the former UFC bantamweight champion has indeed signed a full-time contract with WWE.\n\n\"This is my life now. First priority on my timeline for the next several years. This is not a smash-and-grab; this is not a publicity stunt,\" Rousey told ESPN's Ramona Shelburne in a story that broke immediately after the show. \"When I first met with Triple H, I told him, 'There are other things I can do with my time that'll make way more money, but I won't enjoy nearly as much.'\n\n\"And I don't think that trying to make as much money as possible every single day is the best thing for my happiness. I want to wrestle, and I want to be part of this company, and I want the people that love this sport to accept me and respect me as being part of the sport. I know that'll take time, but I also know that I'm capable of anything.\"\n\nRousey added: \"It's funny -- it's kind of like acting, in that it was something I always wanted to do but I never thought was in the cards for me. And now that I realize I really do have this opportunity, I feel like my 6-year-old self would totally kick my ass if I didn't take it.\"\n\nAfter the first 30-Woman Royal Rumble was won by Asuka, WWE's women's champions Alexa Bliss (Raw) and Charlotte Flair (SmackDown) made their way into the ring with Asuka looking back and forth between the two as they held their championships high. At that moment, \"Bad Reputation\" hit and Rousey made her way to the ring. Rousey immediately pointed at the WrestleMania sign and went to shake Asuka's hand only for Asuka to slap it away. She again pointed at the sign and left the ring, heading to ringside to shake the hand of WWE COO (and storyline Raw commissioner) Stephanie McMahon before smiling, waving to the crowd, hitting some fans' hands and leaving.\n\nA long-time WWE fan, Rousey borrowed her \"Rowdy\" nickname from Roddy Piper with the legend's permission and formed her own mixed martial arts version of the \"Four Hoursewomen\" promoting her relationship with Shayna Baszler, Jessamyn Duke and Marina Shafir. (Baszler is now a full-time wrestler in WWE's NXT developmental program.)\n\nRousey's last in-ring moment in WWE drew a massive reaction as she crashied WrestleMania 31 to aid The Rock in a confrontation with Triple H and McMahon, hip tossing Triple H before grabbing hold of McMahon's arm. Since then, Rousey and WWE have been somewhat inseparable even as she continued working in MMA.\n\nShe has attended multiple WWE events over the years, including the recent Mae Young Classic as she sat in the crowd cheering on Baszler. Rousey, along with Duke and Shafir, egged on WWE's version of the \"Four Horsewomen\" -- Flair, Sasha Banks, Becky Lynch and Bayley -- across the entrance ramp, and WWE even released a video of a confrontation between the groups in the parking lot. (Shafir is the wife of NXT superstar Roderick Strong, so she is already somewhat involved in the world of WWE.)\n\nRousey has been visible in the WWE product as of late, but five months after that WrestleMania 31 appearance, she was still competing in MMA and defeated Bethe Correia via knockout at UFC 190. Three months after that, she suffered her first defeat to Holly Holm in stunning fashion at UFC 193, and one year later, her MMA career basically ended when Amanda Nunes embarrassed her in 48 seconds at UFC 207.\n\nRousey, who began her MMA career with a 12-0 record and defeated five consecutive women in under 66 seconds while defending her title from 2013-15, now appears to have moved on from the sport for good.\n\nIt has not been much of a secret that Rousey has spent the past few months training for a foray into professional wrestling, but now we know for sure that it is her profession of choice. While Rousey could theoretically fight before WrestleMania 34 in April, it seems as if her first match will come on WWE's biggest stage of the year.\n\nEither way, she's excited for the opportunity and to take part in something athletic where the pressure is somewhat off her shoulders with a focus more on her character.\n\n\"It's cool to be in a venue where everything is not taken so literally -- that you can say the things that are on your mind, that you would never say ... like, 'What do you mean, I was just in character!' It's freeing, because there's not so much criticism -- because people know it is all for fun, and it is entertainment,\" she told ESPN.\n\n\"They're not judging you; they're like, 'You're a great heel!' It seems like a safer place to express myself, in a weird way.\""}

The incident almost caused the patient's life.\n\nBut even if the patient survived, Shaun opted to admit his mistake to San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital's chief of surgery Dr. Marcus Andrews (Hill Harper). This will put his and his mentor Dr. Aaron Glassman's (Richard Schiff) licenses in danger.\n\nIn an interview with TVLine, showrunner David Shore talked about the Shaun and Glassman's fate in \"The Good Doctor\" season 2.\n\nAccording to Shore, they have always planned for the ending since the pilot of the show. \"It's important to me that Shaun not just be a superhero with autism, but be a real person with strengths and weaknesses,\" Shore stated.\n\nThe showrunner also mentioned that he wanted Shaun to showcase his excellent skills as a doctor with autism, but also show that he is capable of making both major and minor mistakes.\n\nThe finale also reiterated Glassman's promise in the premiere episode that he will give up his job as the president of the hospital if Shaun will not live up to the expectations. \"You know, if you show a gun in Act 1, it has to be fired in Act 4. That [promise], to me, was the equivalent of a gun, and I wanted to see Shaun make a mistake,\" he also said.\n\nShore also mentioned that fans could expect to see Shaun working back at the hospital when the series returns for its sophomore season. \"I think the focus [of Season 2] is going to be that there's a new hierarchy \u2014 a new sheriff in town,\" he also stated.\n\nOn the other hand, executive producer Daniel Day Kim also teased that there are a lot of things to look forward to in the second season during his interview with E! News before the show's panel at the PaleyFest.\n\n\"David [Shore] has some really wonderful things in store,\" Kim stated. \"Some really nice character turns. Freddie [Highmore]'s journey\u2014Shaun's journey\u2014is going to have a couple of twists and turns that I find incredibly compelling,\" he added.\n\nShore also said in the same interview that he wants to continue exploring the same things and issues where Shaun will be thrown in different situations where he will be challenged. \"Because I think the show superficially is about Dr. Murphy learning how to navigate the world, but I think on a deeper level, the show is much more of what Dr. Murphy has to teach us,\" he also stated.\n\nFans should also expect to see the series talk about Glassman's cancer in the second season of the medical drama.\n\n\"The Good Doctor\" is expected to return to ABC later this year."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Eva Longoria Wants A Desperate Housewives Revival By Nick Venable Random Article Blend Theoretically, any TV hit of the past has a relatively decent chance of returning to the airwaves in a revival format, and there are probably millions of people out there who would re-welcome the women of Wisteria Lane into their homes. They're not alone, either, as Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria recently expressed her interest her own interest in returning to Gaby's lifestyle. I wish! I love that show. I miss it every single day. I miss being Gaby. I miss being on that set. I miss everything about it. But our creator [Marc Cherry] has said many times he wouldn't bring it back. Plus, we're all so busy. Felicity [Huffman] is always off doing some Emmy award--winning show. I'm busy with my projects. I don't know if it will ever happen, but I'm all for the idea! There was nothing desperate about that response, with Eva Longoria expressing a lot of genuine enthusiasm for the idea of bringing Desperate Housewives back to TV. It sounds like it would take zero effort to get her signature on the dotted line, should a contract's dotted line ever appear in front of her. (Hint, hint, ABC and Marc Cherry and everyone else.) While lots of TV stars would counter revival questions with guarded and generic answers, Longoria gave fans exactly the answer that would be most desired. Well, I guess if her answer included a reveal that the show actually IS coming back, that would be the most desired response... Eva Longoria was speaking with NewBeauty when she said those encouraging words, though she did counteract them by reminding everyone that Marc Cherry has consistently affirmed his stance that he doesn't want to do more Desperate Housewives beyond the eight seasons that aired. But we all know that nothing is set in stone when it comes to TV, so maybe once we get a little further away from the series' 2012 finale, Cherry might arrive at a revival idea that he can't put out of his head. And thankfully, the Desperate Housewives finale didn't kill everyone off in a jaw-dropping fashion, so there wouldn't be any need to retcon story points. Anyone looking to see Eva Longoria performances in 2018 will need to first head to theaters for the Overboard remake. We'll hopefully get to see her returning to TV at some point, too. 2017 brought us her stint on Empire and the British miniseries Decline and Fall, as well as an unfortunately non-ordered Fox pilot that co-starred Ken Marino and Andy Richter. While we're not sure if we'll get to see Desperate Housewives back on TV in the future outside of repeats, there are lots of shows that are coming in the next few months, and you can find them all on our 2018 midseason premiere schedule.

{"label": true, "txt": "Google Girls Trip right now, and you'll see two major\u2014and extremely different\u2014results: First, and most importantly, are the headlines about the film's success at the box office and what that means for more films led by women of color in Hollywood (all good things, hopefully). The second? The Grapefruit Method , an oral sex technique demonstrated (hilariously) by Tiffany Haddish\u2014without question the breakout star of Girls Trip .\n\nThe Grapefruit Method isn't a new term or something invented by the film\u2013it was actually first popularized back in 2014 by viral tutorial videos from Auntie Angel of Angel's Erotic Solutions . (You can see that here .) But in a scene-stealing moment of the film, Haddish's character, Dina, demonstrates for her friends the oral sex act while using a grapefruit and a banana as props. Since then, the scene has launched many discussions about whether it's for real.\n\nThe directions, according to Dina, are simple: Cut off the top and bottom of a room-temperature grapefruit, then cut a hole in the middle of it. Place the grapefruit on your partner's member, and then...well, twist.\n\nYou can see a portion of it in the clip below:\n\n\"Grapefruiting is an act of love,\" Haddish explained to Entertainment Weekly in an interview. \"Make it mystical and magical.\" It certainly had an effect on-set: Jada Pinkett Smith told EW that Haddish started receiving love letters from the crew after filming. \"That\u2019s true,\" Haddish confirmed. \"Somebody bought me something from Jared jewelry. All the guys started coming to my comedy shows.\"\n\nAnd Auntie Angel herself thinks the movie got it right, with one exception: \"Use a condom,\" she told TooFab . \"There are chances that citrus can get into his urethra, and he can have a bad experience\u2014and, of course, they proved that in the movie.\"\n\nNow, look, I am not writing this piece to suggest you try it at home or to praise the sex act itself\u2014there's certainly enough material out there promoting sex for men's pleasure (and his pleasure alone), and this is a sex act that's limiting because it was created with only cisgender, heterosexual partners in mind (the grapefruit, as Dina graphically explains, is meant to feel like he's fucking and getting sucked off at once).\n\nBut watching the scene, it felt a bit like women were reclaiming a narrative: These characters are being open about their sex lives, having fun with that discussion, and enjoying the power they feel when trying new, creative things with their partners. Isn't that what we want out of a healthy, sex-positive scene? And on top of that, I think we can all recall at least one time in our lives when men snickered about an Urban Dictionary-discovered sex act, with the intention to shock or gross out the women in the room. In Girls Trip , we see a situation where the women have owned their sex lives fully: They're knowledgeable and confident, not squeamish about experimenting. Having seen enough gross-out sex scenes in male-driven comedies in my time, it felt refreshing to watch a woman hilariously, authentically prove that women do it, too\u2014in more ways than one.\n\nAt the very least, to quote Queen Latifah , \"I gained a whole new respect for Tiffany after that.\"\n\nRELATED: 10 Pro-Woman Porn Sites Your Clitoris Will Thank You For"}

The Riverdale stars worked with the YMCA to help teens get dolled up and prepped for prom. Luckily for us, we don\u2019t have to wait to see the ensembles the actresses put together. JCPenney\u2019s new prom collection is already here, so you can take a peek at the pieces that speak to your own personal style.\n\nCamila and Lili spoke to HelloGiggles about why it was so important for them to be part of this shoot, the one brow product they\u2019re *both* obsessed with, and the beauty tips they borrow from each other.\n\nJoe Scarnici/Getty Images for Moet Hennessy\n\nHelloGiggles: What beauty tips have you learned from each other?\n\nLili Reinhart: I specifically deal with cystic acne, whereas Camila has otherwise perfect, poreless skin. I couldn\u2019t really take too much away from her beauty routine because she and I are different when it comes to our skin. But I think Cammie and I are both very minimalistic when it comes to our makeup in the real world. We very much wear minimal makeup when we go out to dinner or when we\u2019re not working. We let our skin breathe as much as possible. I know I do. My skin breaks out a lot from wearing makeup for up to 14 hours a day, five to six days a week. I love to be bare-faced and let my skin breathe. And if anything, I just cover up any zits with concealer and then fill in my brows. Lately, I\u2019ve used my Glossier Boy Brow.\n\nCamila Mendes: I\u2019ve learned a lot. Lili\u2019s like a skin expert. So I\u2019ve learned from how much she takes care of her skin. I used to not really have an intense skin regimen. I would just wash my face and go to sleep. My skin wasn\u2019t very problematic, but now that I\u2019m constantly wearing loads and loads of makeup on a daily basis, I see how much Lili takes care of her skin and she has all these different products. She got me hooked on getting facials by Kate Somerville and the drying lotion Mario Badescu.\n\nAmanda Edwards/WireImage\n\nHG: What\u2019s the most surprising thing about your skin care routine?\n\nLR: I\u2019ve been really trying to change things up to more advanced skin care, more clinical-grade. My skin\u2019s very high maintenance. I break out at the smallest environmental change, anytime I\u2019m slightly stressed, or have lack of sleep. And it causes me to have to change up my skin care routine pretty frequently, and recycle products and see what works at the time, but I\u2019ve always been a supporter of Kate Somerville skin care products. And lately, I\u2019ve been trying ZO Skin Care. That\u2019s pretty clinical-grade for my acne, and they have a really wonderful environmental shield. That, to me, seems to really help with the fact that I live in Vancouver, and the weather is very rainy, cloudy, and dreary. I also love masks. Every night I use a different mask, and I use a lot of Renee Rouleau. She specializes in cystic acne, and I use a lot of her products as well. I\u2019m a skin care junkie and have a little bit of everything.\n\nCM: It\u2019s just gotten so complex. I never thought I would be using toner. I used to not know what toner was, and now I have to use toner before I put anything on my face. I feel like everyone I talk to who\u2019s an expert in skin, they\u2019re like, \u201cOh my god, toner is the best thing to do because it just balances your PH.\u201d I feel that brings out the most natural healing element to your skin. I have such a strict regimen now. I always wash my face before going to sleep and I do my whole routine. Put on the spot treatment and go to sleep.\n\nGary Gershoff/WireImage\n\nHG: What are some under $10 beauty products you swear by?\n\nLR: I\u2019ve talked about it before. It\u2019s the Aztec Indian Healing Clay Mask. I use Carmex chapstick for my lips. My lips get really irritated and dry, especially in this weather, so I use Carmex on set. Neutrogena\u2019s oil blotters are my favorite thing. I have combination skin, so it\u2019s oily and dry, but I\u2019m a big oil-blotter kind of girl. I use the Mario Badescu\u2019s Rose Water spray mist. I use that all the time, and I just use rose water in general for my face as a toner and that stuff\u2019s the best. I dampen my BeautyBlender on set with rose water before I apply my foundation.\n\nCM: I\u2019m a big Burt\u2019s Bees fan. I use so much Burt\u2019s Bees. I\u2019m literally looking at all my Burt\u2019s Bees products right now. I have a Burt\u2019s Bees Facial Cleanser for Sensitive Skin. I have Burt\u2019s Bees Eye Makeup Remover Pads, Burt\u2019s Bees Rosewater Toner, Burt\u2019s Bees Sensitive Daily Moisturizing Cream and then Burt\u2019s Bees Facial Cleansing Towelettes. I should sponsor Burt\u2019s Bees. It\u2019s funny, my makeup artist jokes with me. She\u2019s like, \u201cYou love Burt\u2019s Bees,\u201d but it\u2019s funny because I hate bees. I\u2019m terrified of bees. It\u2019s a pretty known thing on set, yet I use entirely bee products.\n\nHG: For Camila, let\u2019s talk brows. What brow products do you personally use?\n\nCM: I\u2019ve had arched eyebrows since forever. Even when you see pictures of me when I was a little kid, my eyebrows were so strong. I had a unibrow too. I\u2019ve always had a lot of hair on my brows. Then, I went through a phase where I was plucking them a lot in junior high because I thought that I was going to be prettier if they were thinner. But now, everyone\u2019s embracing the fuller brow and I\u2019ve just let them grow out. I like to shape them myself, I just kind of pluck around it. I mostly only pluck in the middle because I like to keep it as full as possible. I don\u2019t really touch them too often. I just brush them out and I\u2019ll fill them in a little bit. I use a Chanel brow pencil that\u2019s really nice and I use a clear mascara to keep them in place because they\u2019re wild. If I don\u2019t put gel on them, they\u2019ll go all sorts of places. I like the CoverGirl clear mascara. It\u2019s quick and it does the job. Boy Brow from Glossier is great, too. I like using it when I\u2019m not wearing much makeup and don\u2019t want to fill in my brows.\n\nHG: Why was it important to y\u2019all to team up with JCPenney on this campaign?\n\nLR: It was the charitable aspect of it. The idea that we were being involved in a program that was helping these teens, who otherwise, wouldn\u2019t have had an opportunity to have a really wonderful prom outfit. You know? And JC Penney is so affordable and this kind of gave teens an opportunity to go to a photo shoot and get glammed up. And I thought that was such a cool idea, and immediately something that I wanted to be part of. I never went to prom, I never had a chance to go to prom. I had to switch to online school when I was a junior in high school because I moved across the country and didn\u2019t want to go to a new school when I was a junior, so I didn\u2019t get to go to prom. So, it was kind of like a really nice opportunity for me to help other people in their experience because I didn\u2019t have my own. I was blown away by their aspirations and where they want to go to college and what they wanted to do.\n\nCM: What drew me to it the most was the message behind it. Me and Lili talked about it and we were like, \u201cThis is so great that we get to meet these girls who have not only watched our show but are very ambitious, young women and men, too.\u201d We got to talk to them, got to know them, and kind of made them feel empowered and tried to inspire them, even though honestly, they were already such inspiring people. Everyone had such big goals and they were all getting into great schools and it honestly inspired me and Lili more so than we inspired them probably. So that was the best feeling. Kind of helping them realize their dream prom look that they might not have been able to afford otherwise. When you\u2019re a teenager you\u2019re kind of at this critical point in your life where you\u2019re discovering yourself and experimenting with different looks and trying to figure out what works for you. So to be a part of that process for them and helping them guide themselves in a way. I was very grateful to be in that experience.\n\nCourtesy of JCPenney\n\nHG: I\u2019m sure it was nice for them to get dolled up for a day and do something they normally wouldn\u2019t.\n\nLR: Yeah, totally, it gave them a chance to do something that they otherwise never would have been able to do, and just kind of experiencing the spotlight for a second. I think a lot of them had to step out of their comfort zones for sure, but it was so fun to see them do that and to be pampered for a day.\n\nCourtesy of JCPenney\n\nHG: Camila, did you go to prom?\n\nCM: I did, and I found my dress at a thrift store. After a week of looking at department stores and not finding the right one\u2026You what\u2019s funny actually? Now, that I remember it, I did buy a dress. I bought a dress and I took it home, and then the next day, I went to the thrift store and found another dress and I ended up wearing that one. I ended up wearing the $50 dress instead of the $400 dress that I bought.\n\nHG: For Lili, would you go as dark Betty to prom?\n\nLR: My style, I\u2019m still trying to figure out what that is, but I feel like I\u2019m very into classical, Hollywood shapes and looks. I\u2019m always attracted to black dresses. They\u2019re very slimming, classic, and timeless. I probably would stick to an old Hollywood vibe for prom if I went to prom right now. That\u2019s just something I\u2019d love to do. I\u2019ve never really been a ball gown type of girl, but I\u2019m sure some people would love to go all out and do that for their prom. But I think I\u2019m more minimalistic.\n\nMaarten de Boer/Getty Images Portrait\n\nHG: Was there a prom dress in a movie or show that you always wanted?\n\nLR: When you said that, a dress from The Devil Wears Prada popped in my head. I think it\u2019s one of the dresses that Anne Hathaway wears in Paris. Maybe it\u2019s one of the black dress that she wears when she\u2019s at an event with Miranda Priestly and Emily. I can\u2019t give you anything more specific than that, but I know it\u2019s a dress that Anne Hathaway wears in Devil Wears Prada when she\u2019s at an event.\n\nCM: I don\u2019t remember any prom looks from shows that I watched. Because I really was into teen dramas as a teen. I loved the OC and Gossip Girl, but I can\u2019t remember any of the prom dresses. But they had events all the time."}
{"label": true, "txt": "If you were to mentally sort the contents of your makeup bag into the categories of products you use every day \u2014 the ones you save for special occasions and those you own but never use \u2014 lip liner would most likely fall in the last category, right? But while lip pencils are is widely seen as a gratuitous extra step, they're actually the key to creating the perfect pouty lip, according to celebrity makeup artists Ash Holm and Mary Phillips.\n\nBut it's no secret that liner is the trick to creating the illusion of fuller lips. In fact, using a lip pencil to overline your lips is a classic hack, dating back to Clara Bow in the '20s and seen again on runways (and on celebs everywhere) in the '90s. The technique is simply just hard to nail without looking dated. Thankfully, Ash and Mary both reveal their tricks for a modern take on the overdrawn lip.\n\n1. Stick with a neutral tone.\n\nBoth artists suggest sticking to a matte neutral shade when softly cheating the line to keep the look natural and current. Ash says the key is to use a nude shade with the same undertones as your skin tone that way the contrast of shades looks cohesive. For instance, if you have pink undertones, use a neutral shade with a slightly pink hue to it for your most flattering shade.\n\n2. Start by shading in the corners.\n\nUse a super-sharp lip pencil (Mary says the pointier the pencil, the more precise your application will be) to begin shading the corners of your lips versus following the lip line exactly, Ash says. This not only contours them, but also softens the line making the hack a little less noticeable.\n\n3. Don't go too far outside your natural lip line.\n\nAfter you've shaded in the corners, trace along your lip line while gradually veering outside of your mouth's natural perimeter as you move toward the center of your top and bottom lips \u2014 but only slightly! Both Ash and Mary agree that following your natural shape (and not going too far outside the natural border) will look the most natural, while also effectively enhancing your pout. Mary says for her clients whose faces can carry a lot more makeup, she'll shade over the cupids bow rather than along it, but adds that this can be tricky to pull off. If it looks silly, you've probably pushed it a bit too far.\n\n4. Blend out the edges.\n\nAsh uses a lip brush, while Mary prefers to use the warmth of her finger to pat and melt the liner into the skin. But either way, the goal is the same: to blend the edge of the liner toward the inside of the lips to soften the line.\n\n5. Fill in the center with lipstick.\n\nUse a lipstick shade similar to the liner for a subtler effect, or opt for a slightly lighter lipstick to emphasize the line. To complete the look, Ash uses a brush to apply a matte lipstick on the center of the top and bottom lips, blending it out toward the perimeter of the mouth. She also loves using a matte or liquid lipstick for the finishing touch, because the matte textures make the pouty effect stand out more. Mary starts off the look with matte pencil liner as well, but prefers to use a product with a gel-like formula or something with a subtle sheen on the center of the pout for a more satin finish.\n\nShop Ash and Mary's favorite products for nailing the overdrawn lip:"}

{"label": true, "txt": "Real Housewives of New Jersey star Teresa Giudice endured an entire year behind bars \u2013 but is she cheating on her husband while he serves out his sentence? Teresa has been visiting her husband, Joe, on a weekly basis, yet sources claim that she\u2019s already moved on to another man.\n\nAccording to Us Magazine, Teresa\u2019s prison visits have gotten less frequent over the past month. While the couple\u2019s kids continue to talk to their dad on the phone, Teresa has started dating a businessman from New Jersey and hasn\u2019t seen Joe in months. In fact, Teresa\u2019s former friend, Kim DePaola, claims that she\u2019s been dating the man for almost half a year.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been pretty cozy I\u2019m going to say in the last five months,\u201d she stated.\n\nWhile Teresa is getting a little side action while her husband is in prison, DePaola doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s doing anything wrong. After all, Joe has allegedly cheated on Teresa on multiple occasions, though they have both denied it.\n\n\u201cI think Teresa has every right to go out and find somebody else. She should leave Joe,\u201d DePaola added.\n\nIn light of the cheating rumors, The Hollywood Gossip reports that Teresa\u2019s lawyer, James J. Leonard Jr., revealed that Teresa is not having an affair while Joe is behind bars. Not only does she deny the reports, but Leonard slammed the people who started the rumors, calling them \u201cattention-seeking lowlifes.\u201d\n\nDePaola, on the other hand, is sticking by her story. In fact, she says that two different people told her about Teresa Giudice\u2019s affair. At the end of the day, DePaola, who is currently involved in a feud with Teresa, believes she should leave Joe and start a new life with somebody else.\n\nTo make matters worse, OK Magazine reports that Joe is on the list for deportation. The Italian-born business man is not a U.S. citizen and is serving a three-year sentence for fraud. Unless Teresa can get the government to wave Joe\u2019s deportation status, then it\u2019s only a matter of time before he is sent back to Italy.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BUPZe_1DH6h/?taken-by=teresagiudice&hl=en\n\nThere\u2019s no telling if Teresa can keep Joe in the U.S. Joe\u2019s fate will be determined by how he obtained a green card. If the reality star applied for a green card while in the U.S. then Teresa could win her case. If not, then Joe will likely be deported.\n\nTell us! Do you think Teresa Giudice is cheating on Joe while he is behind bars? Let us know in the comments below.\n\n[Featured Image by Bravo]"}

{"label": true, "txt": "Tamika Lamison was a 27-year-old stage actress living in New York City in June 1996 when she stepped into Hollywood manager Vincent Cirrincione's hotel suite, excited by the unexpected opportunity to audition for the man behind Halle Berry's rising stardom.\n\nLamison said she had been introduced to Cirrincione the previous night by one of his clients at the Tony Awards dinner. Soon after her arrival at the hotel, Cirrincione's phone rang. It was Berry. He put the famous actress on speaker as Lamison listened in silently, in awe \u2014 thinking that perhaps Cirrincione could steer her own acting career to Hollywood success in an industry with few leading roles for African American actresses like her.\n\nWhen the call ended, Lamison began reciting a poem she had written. Midway through her performance, she said, Cirrincione grabbed her and started kissing her, sticking his tongue in her mouth.\n\nShe said he told her that he could take her on as a client, on the condition that he would get to see her for sex whenever he wanted. She said she pushed him away and left.\n\nLamison is among nine women \u2014 eight African Americans and one Asian American \u2014 who have told The Washington Post that Cirrincione made unwanted sexual advances toward them over a period of two decades. Several said they viewed Cirrincione, who is white, as an important gatekeeper for black actresses in an industry notoriously difficult to break into \u2014 one whose path is even more narrow for minorities. They said he took advantage of that dynamic to prey upon young women of color seeking an entry into Hollywood.\n\nThree of the women say that he pushed for sex as a condition for representing them, and that he did not take them on when they refused. A fourth said he offered to help advance her career if she agreed to have sex with him monthly. A fifth actress said he masturbated in front of her in his office during the years he managed her.\n\n\n\nPeppur Chambers created, produced and acted in a burlesque group called the Brown Betties. (Courtesy of Peppur Chambers/Courtesy of Peppur Chambers)\n\nThe Post interviewed each of the women separately, multiple times over a three-month period, as well as friends, family members and others in whom the women said they confided aspects of their interactions with Cirrincione. The earliest allegation of inappropriate conduct was in 1993, and the most recent in 2011.\n\nCirrincione said in a statement that he accepts responsibility for pursuing sexual relationships but denies allegations that he sought sexual favors in exchange for representing actresses.\n\n\"We live in a time where men are being confronted with a very real opportunity to take responsibility for their actions. I support this movement wholeheartedly. I have had female clients and employees my entire career in this industry. I have built a reputation for advancing the careers of women of color,\" Cirrincione said.\n\n\"I have had affairs while in committed relationships, ones I am now ashamed to say are coming to light and shading my past and my reputation. I can say without a doubt that I have never used favors, sexual or otherwise, as a reason for managing anyone. I want to make it clear that not one of those relationships were anything but consensual.\n\n\"I take responsibility for my part in the situation and I am not here to diminish anyone's feelings or experiences. I apologize to these women, my past and present partner, my clients and employees for the pain this is bringing them. I was under the impression I was living my life as a supportive man to women. It is with a heavy heart that I see now I was wrong.\"\n\n\n\nVincent Cirrincione and Halle Berry pose at a screening of HBO\u2019s \u201cLackawanna Blues\u201d at the Directors Guild of America in 2005 in West Hollywood, California. (Kevin Winter/Getty Images)\n\nThe nine women distinguished Cirrincione's behavior from Harvey Weinstein's, which included accusations of rape that the Hollywood titan has denied. None have made criminal allegations against Cirrincione or sought legal recourse. Six did not want their names published out of concern for their families and relationships in the industry; some have friends who continue to be represented by Cirrincione.\n\n[Violence. Threats. Begging. Harvey Weinstein\u2019s 30-year pattern of abuse in Hollywood]\n\nThe women's allegations portray a pattern of sexual harassment dating back to the early 1990s, when Cirrincione, now 70, ran his fledgling management career out of a New York City apartment building. Six of the women, including an Asian American model, say they have abandoned their acting careers or took extended breaks from the business in part because of their encounters with Cirrincione, who they say shattered their confidence and sense of self-worth.\n\nAll of the women say they sought his representation because of his reputation for boosting the careers of black actresses such as Berry and in later years Taraji P. Henson, clients whose names and film achievements the women say he dangled before them as bait.\n\nOne of the actresses said that during her audition for Cirrincione in the early 2000s, he told her she reminded him of Berry when Berry was starting out.\n\n\"Of course that was like your dream to have Halle Berry's manager say, 'Oh, my God, you remind me of Halle,' \" said the woman, who is now a fashion and lifestyle blogger.\n\nShe said Cirrincione called her after the audition to tell her that she wasn't quite ready for his agency but that he would help her get new headshots and appear with her at industry events to introduce her to the right people \u2014 on the condition that she sleep with him once a month.\n\n\"He said it so matter-of-factly, like we were just going to get coffee,\" she said.\n\nHe told her to think about his offer, she recalled. When she did not follow up, she said he called a week later to apologize, told her she was a \"good girl\" and asked her to \"forget what we talked about.\" A friend in whom she confided at the time said that she had told him about the conversations with Cirrincione.\n\nAnother actress who met Cirrincione in 2005 during the Los Angeles premiere party of \"Hustle & Flow,\" featuring Henson, said the manager invited her to audition for him. She was 36 at the time, with no television or film credits. She said he told her during her audition that he was the only manager who knew what to do with black actresses.\n\nShe said he told her he could change her life if he signed her \u2014 just as he had for Berry and Henson. Then she said he propositioned her, saying that would be part of their business deal. She told him she was not interested. The woman's sister and then-boyfriend said she described the incident to them immediately after it occurred.\n\nWhat Cirrincione\n\nseemed to represent\n\nTo the women, Cirrincione had represented their best hopes of breaking in and making it in a fiercely competitive industry rife with racial discrimination. Of the top 168 U.S. films ranked by global box office performance in 2015, only 11 leading roles were played by black actors, compared with 145 by white actors, according to data analyzed by an author of UCLA's 2017 Hollywood diversity report. Black women starred in two films; white women starred in 44.\n\nCirrincione's reputation for seeking sexual relationships with aspiring stars was an open secret in Hollywood, the women said \u2014 one they learned about only after their encounters with him. One actress, upon confiding her experience to her acting teacher years later, said the teacher immediately identified Cirrincione without the actress having named him. Two women said they later heard about other actresses' experiences with Cirrincione, one from her manager and the other from her attorney.\n\nThe women interviewed by The Post said they stayed silent for years about the harassment they said they endured because they feared repercussions to their careers and reputations. Several said they had also experienced sexual harassment and assault by other men in the industry. They said they knew of no reporting mechanism at the time to hold the men accountable for their behavior.\n\n\"Any kind of sexual misconduct or harassment that's talked about from women is automatically suspect,\" said Lamison, who runs a program to cultivate more women and minority directors. \"For black women, it seems like we are even more marginalized when it comes to something like that. Historically, how we have been treated and looked at \u2014 and to some degree oversexualized \u2014 makes it difficult.\"\n\nThe women said that the national reckoning set off by the accusations against Weinstein and other powerful men in Hollywood have given them courage to publicly share their experiences and that they hoped their stories would help young minority women navigating the industry.\n\nBerry, who had joined fellow actresses in donning black gowns at the Golden Globe Awards in January as part of Hollywood's Time's Up movement against workplace sexual harassment, said in a statement that she ended her relationship with Cirrincione more than three years ago after learning of a misconduct allegation against him.\n\n\"Over three years ago, a woman was on the radio saying that Halle Berry's manager was her worst casting couch experience ever. That news literally stopped me in my tracks. I immediately confronted Vince about it, and he denied it completely. But even with his denial, something didn't feel right in my spirit, and with the possibility that it could be true, I immediately ended our over-25-year relationship,\" Berry said.\n\nBerry did not hear the woman's name and could not remember the radio program, according to her representative.\n\nCirrincione said he does not recall any confrontation with Berry over the program.\n\n\"I never heard that from Halle. We never had a discussion. I'm totally shocked. It's not like she left me abruptly,\" Cirrincione said in an interview.\n\nBerry said she was \"saddened\" to learn of more allegations of sexual harassment against her former manager.\n\n\"While Vince never made an inappropriate gesture toward me, nor did I hear about this type of behavior from any woman or man while we worked together, I have always had a no-tolerance policy when it came to such matters,\" Berry said. \"My heart goes out to any person who is subject to this type of behavior, and I stand in support of their strength and bravery.\"\n\nBerry, a Miss USA first runner-up, met Cirrincione in 1988 after one of his soap opera clients recommended her for a part calling for a young black actress.\n\nTo this day, Berry is the only black woman to have won the Academy Award for best actress in a leading role. The biracial actress has publicly credited her success to Cirrincione, calling him her \"secret weapon\" in a 2002 New York Times interview. He's even helped her land parts written for white women, in \"The Flintstones\" and \"The Last Boy Scout.\"\n\nCirrincione and Berry co-produced \"Introducing Dorothy Dandridge,\" a 1999 HBO film about the tragic life of the first African American woman to be nominated for a best actress Oscar.\n\nHenson, an Oscar-nominated actress whose career Cirrincione has managed for two decades, said in an interview that she has never heard of nor witnessed any inappropriate behavior by Cirrincione toward women.\n\n\"I've never had any issue with this on any level,\" Henson said. \"He totally respected me.\"\n\nHenson, who produced and stars in the new action film \"Proud Mary,\" said she regarded Cirrincione as a \"father figure\" who helped her rise in Hollywood. She said he would at times pay for her rent, child-care fees and, later, her son's school tuition.\n\n\"He saw a single mother trying to make her dreams come true, and he nurtured that,\" Henson said. \"He wrote checks and wouldn't ask for anything in return. It wasn't coming from a creepy place. If anything, it empowered me. Like this man believes in me. I love him for that.\"\n\nHenson said she does not view Cirrincione as an all-powerful gatekeeper for black women in the industry but, rather, that he was especially supportive of black women.\n\n\"He is always brutally honest with me about black women's space in this industry,\" Henson said, referring to him preparing her for lower pay and limited leading roles because black women were not seen as appealing in the overseas market. \"I just looked to him as a man who understood the black woman's plight in the industry. I never looked at him as a magical, mythical creature.\"\n\n\"He would say: 'I did this with Halle, because I know how the game is played. We have to carve your own lane. You have a voice out here,' \" she said. \"He didn't sugarcoat how hard it is here for us. We just have to keep fighting, and one day the doors will open.\"\n\nCirrincione has also been Henson's producing partner. Henson's publicist, Pam Sharp, is Cirrincione's longtime girlfriend.\n\n[The rise and fall of Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood mogul accused of serial sexual harassment]\n\n'He held the keys to the kingdom of access'\n\nThe women who spoke about their experiences with Cirrincione said that the alleged sexual misconduct had lasting effects on their personal and professional lives. \"You have people who say he just made a pass, that he was just making an offer. But that's not just what happened,\" said Lamison, whose mother also recounted Lamison's experience. \"He is abusing his power in a way that is really damaging.\"\n\nSome of the women have moved into behind-the-scenes roles in Hollywood or left the industry. Three said they have undergone years of therapy as a result of Cirrincione's behavior.\n\nLamison, a screenwriter, director and producer, runs her own foundation pairing seriously ill children with Hollywood figures to create short films. She produced and stars in \"Last Life,\" a film premiering this month at the Pan African Film Festival.\n\nIn one of the earliest allegations of Cirrincione's sexual misconduct with aspiring actresses, which predates when Berry's career \u2014 and his \u2014 took off in Hollywood, former stage actress Letha Remington recalled what she describes as an inappropriate meeting when she sought his representation in 1993, a time when the manager was based out of an apartment building on West 55th Street and Eighth Avenue in New York.\n\nDuring their third meeting, Remington said Cirrincione began caressing her shoulders and told her he was lonely because his wife at the time was a nurse who worked nights. He did not explicitly proposition her, but when Remington spurned his advances, he told her that he could not represent her.\n\n\"It made me feel like I had to be clever enough to maneuver around that and get the opportunity that I needed to make it on my own talent, not on sleeping with somebody,\" Remington said. Her daughter said in an interview that Remington shared the story about brushing off Cirrincione's advances years ago.\n\nIn one of the most recent allegations, a biracial actress said she sent her headshot to Cirrincione in 2010, after other managers told her they already had a \"mixed girl\" or that they did not know how to pitch her.\n\nAfter several visits to his office, the actress said that Cirrincione invited the then-28-year-old woman to a small gathering at his house, but when she arrived, they were alone.\n\nShe recalled Cirrincione sitting across from her on the floor and recounting the early days of Berry's career. She said he pointed out a children's play structure in his yard that he said was for Berry's daughter. She opened up to him about the sexual and physical abuse she had endured as a child, her mother's suicide, her own depression and the abusive relationships she has been in as an adult.\n\nShe said he told her he could make her a star like Berry, Henson and Annie Ilonzeh, an actress in the short-lived television remake of \"Charlie's Angels.\" Then she said he tried to kiss her and pulled her breasts out of her shirt. She claimed he unzipped his pants, took out his penis and asked her to spit on it.\n\nWhen she recoiled, she said he told her he did not know what the big deal was, adding that all his actresses participate, and pushed her head down toward his lap.\n\n\"In my mind, I was like, just get the representation. Just get past this,\" she said. So she pretended she was playing a role. She said she spit on his penis while he masturbated. Afterward, she said he told her not to feel bad and bragged about his sexual relationships with the women he represents.\n\nShe said Cirrincione repeatedly asked her to return to his office to read for him over the course of several months. During those visits, she said he would grope her breasts and tell her how he masturbated to a short film she had submitted. But he never took her on as a client, leaving her feeling exploited, unworthy and broken, she said.\n\nFour people in whom she confided at the time remembered the conversations.\n\n\"I had a lot of fears he was blacklisting me,\" she said. \"He played the 'I'm the father to all black actresses' role. It's kind of like being a kid when somebody takes you aside that you trust and starts molesting you.\"\n\nPeppur Chambers, who created, produced and acted in a burlesque group called the Brown Betties, said Cirrincione invited her to his home in 2011 after she approached him to produce her show.\n\nAs they sat on the couch watching one of his client's television shows, she said he tried to kiss her but she turned and his lips landed on her head.\n\n\"In my head, I was like: 'This is dumb. Why am I even here?' \" Chambers said. \"I remember feeling like I'm going to take this for the team. You feel like you're selling your soul for what you want.\"\n\nChambers, 47, said she felt she had little choice but to tolerate his advances because Cirrincione had agreed to invest as an executive producer of her dinner theater cabaret. And while she never reciprocated, she said she felt complicit simply by continuing to meet with him for at least four months. The show's co-producer said that Chambers had shared details of her experience with Cirrincione at the time it occurred.\n\nOne writer and filmmaker whom Cirrincione represented in the mid-1990s said she continuously dodged a barrage of sexual propositions from him during the decade she worked with him.\n\n\"It was always sex all the time with Vincent \u2014 wanting sex, wanting to know about sex,\" she said.\n\nHer attorney recalled the woman's discomfort with Cirrincione's advances during the years they worked together.\n\nThe writer and filmmaker said she continued working with him because having Cirrincione as her advocate was invaluable for her career.\n\n\"He was the doorway that I took. He held the keys to the kingdom of access,\" she said. \"He was a champion for me at a time when nobody was a champion for black women. Hollywood is so much about who's in your corner and who is helping you. As a woman of color, we don't have a lot of allies, and we don't have a lot of opportunities.\"\n\nThe price was suffering in silence, with repercussions that lasted years beyond their partnership, the woman said.\n\n\"I had to kind of keep the truth a secret,\" she said. \"The price I paid for having my good professional relationship with him was giving up my sense of self, of wholeness, of personal worth.\"\n\nOne actress who said Cirrincione represented her for more than a decade beginning in the 1990s alleged that he masturbated at his desk during many of their meetings.\n\n\"I let him sit there and masturbate, thinking this is crazy. I wondered if I was dressed inappropriately,\" she said.\n\nShe said over the years, Cirrincione used Berry's rising celebrity as a carrot. When Berry won her Oscar for best actress for \"Monster's Ball\" in 2002, the woman said Cirrincione told her to stick with him because he would help position her for an Oscar, too.\n\n\"Halle was definitely part of his play, and now Taraji is,\" she said.\n\nProfessionally, she said she was doing well under his management. He booked auditions. He got her in the right doors. He paid for headshots and acting classes. She was working.\n\nShe said she felt conflicted when other actresses asked her to recommend them to Cirrincione. \"There was always a knot in my stomach,\" she said. \"I'd always have a soft prelude, telling them he's flirty, know your boundaries, protect yourself.\"\n\nShe said she never told anyone at the time about Cirrincione's behavior because she rationalized that it was not the worst thing that could be happening to her. He wasn't raping her, she figured; he was just a \"little perverted.\"\n\nAfter allegations of Weinstein's sexual misconduct surfaced, she shared aspects of her encounters with Cirrincione with two friends, who recounted the conversations.\n\n\"Protecting him was protecting me and my dreams and my career,\" she said. \"I wanted to be a famous actress, and maybe this is something I just had to do in that pursuit.\"\n\nJulie Tate contributed to this report."}

{"label": true, "txt": "The 2019 Golden Globes nominations are out. Let\u2019s first hit some surprises, because there were some rather huge ones on the TV side.\n\nNBC\u2019s fan favorite The Good Place was finally honored for best comedy series. Sacha Baron Cohen unexpectedly crashed the best actor in a comedy category for Showtime\u2019s political prank series Who Is America? The excellent imported BBC/Netflix thriller Bodyguard got a best drama series nod. And Candice Bergen was nominated for CBS\u2019 low-rated (and presumed canceled) Murphy Brown reboot. With the exception of The Good Place honor, top oddsmakers did not see any of those coming.\n\nWe\u2019ll have more of surprises along the way. But here are the biggest snubs in the TV categories.\n\nThe Handmaids Tale (Hulu).The dystopian drama swept the Emmys for its debut season in 2017 and won for best drama series at the Globes last year. Yet season 2 failed to get a nomination in the top category, and it was a title on every prediction list (stars Elisabeth Moss and Yvonne Strahovski were both nominated, as expected). This is a pretty shocking omission, though the latest season was admittedly more divisive among critics and fans than the first.\n\nWestworld (HBO). Another big drama series snub. The second season cleaned up at the Emmys a few months ago, with four wins, but aside from a supporting nod for Thandi Newton, the Hollywood Foreign Press was apparently less impressed. Actors Ed Harris, Jeffrey Wright and Evan Rachel Wood were all left out. Also absent from the drama category: The second season of Ozark (Netflix) was snubbed, though star Jason Bateman was nominated.\n\nAtlanta (FX): The second season of the innovative rap-scene comedy, despite being an Emmy favorite, was surprisingly shut out of the top comedy slots (though star Donald Glover was nominated). Also snubbed was another Emmy darling, Netflix\u2019s \u201980s wrestling dramedy GLOW (yet actress Alison Brie got a nod). There was an upside: The Good Place (NBC) finally broke into this category with its first Globes comedy series nomination, and star Kristen Bell was nominated for lead actress in a comedy too.\n\nSterling K. Brown, John Krasinski, Liev Schreiber, Milo Ventimiglia and Bob Odenkirk. The best actor in a drama category featured some serious upsets. Last year\u2019s winner, Brown, was fully expected to at least get a nomination once again for This Is Us. Three-time nominee Odenkirk was fully expected to get recognized for Better Call Saul. Krasinski was fully expected to get nominated for his work in Amazon\u2019s Jack Ryan. Five-time nominee Schreiber was fully expected to get nominated once again (due to the HFPA\u2019s curious love for Showtime\u2019s Ray Donovan). And Ventimiglia, well, he wasn\u2019t fully expected to get a This Is Us nod, but some thought he might squeeze in. Instead, there were new additions like Stephan James for Amazon\u2019s Homecoming and Billy Porter for FX\u2019s Pose.\n\nJodie Comer. The Killing Eve actress was expected to get a nomination for lead actress in a drama series along with her co-star Sandra Oh (who was nominated), yet was shut out. Robin Wright was also snubbed for the final season of Netflix\u2019s House of Cards. Instead, there was a minor surprise on the list: Outlander\u2019s Caitriona Balfe, who was nominated last year, but wasn\u2019t necessarily expected to make the list this time given the intense competition from newcomers like Oh and Homecoming\u2018s Julia Roberts.\n\nTed Danson. While The Good Place received nominations for best comedy series and an actress nod for Kristen Bell, Danson, who was considered the most likely nom of the three, was left out. Blame Sacha Baron Cohen?\n\nManiac (Netflix): Many thought the psychological dark comedy-drama was brilliant and unlike anything else on TV this year, so it was expected to get a nom in the movie-limited series category. Nope. Star Emma Stone was also left out for Maniac \u2014 the Globes snub which seemed to elicit the most Twitter upset this morning among the TV categories. Stone did receive a supporting nod for her work in the movie The Favourite, however.\n\nPatrick Melrose (Showtime) was also skipped in the series limited series category, despite predictions, though that\u2019s more understandable given the project\u2019s somewhat lackluster reaction \u2014 all the praise was around the boozy performance of star Benedict Cumberbatch (who was of course nominated). Another Showtime snub in the movies-mini category: Benicio Del Toro, who was given strong odds to land a mention for his work in Escape at Dannemora.\n\nMovie nominations snubs and surprises here.\n\nFull list of Golden Globes nominations."}

{"label": true, "txt": "The warm weather does wonders for our souls, but we could certainly do without the extra time it takes to shave, wax and laser off every exposed hair on our bodies. Before you reach for that razor, make sure your preferred hair-removal technique is also kind to your skin.\n\nBecause there's no point in removing unwanted hair if it's only going to expose skin that we're damaging in the process, it's high time we find out, once and for all, whether we should be shaving, waxing, getting electrolysis treatments \u2014 or none of the above.\n\nWe spoke with Dr. Diane De Fiori, consultant and research dermatologist with the Rosacea Treatment Clinic, and esthetician Felicia Alva of Flutter Beauty, and got the scoop on the best and worst ways we can remove hair on our legs, bodies and faces.\n\nHere they are, ranked from worst to best.\n\nMore: The 20 Most Game-Changing Beauty Products of 2018 so Far\n\n7. Shaving\n\nThe easiest, and one of the cheapest, methods we rely on is also one that can leave our skin bumpy, stubbly and even bloody.\n\n\"Because the razor cuts the hair at an angle, it has a tendency to regrow inward (causing ingrown hairs), particularly if hair is curly,\" De Fiori said. \"The result is bumpy and inflamed, infected skin which will not resolve until the ingrown hair is removed.\"\n\nDe Fiori adds that possible complications from shaving can include scarring, breaking fine capillaries when removing the hair and permanent dark marks (hyperpigmentation) after healing has completed. One possible benefit? \"The razor itself does have a moderate exfoliating effect, removing dead surface skin cells as you shave, which leaves skin smoother.\"\n\n6. Hair-removal creams\n\nProducts like Veet and other hair-removal creams are similar to permanent solutions, according to De Fiori, and can dissolve hair at the skin level. Because the hair remains in the follicle and is burned away evenly, there is less chance that ingrown hairs will develop. Sounds great, right? Hold that thought.\n\n\"The main risk with these products is chemical burns because they are strongly alkaline,\" De Fiori said. \"A burn is more likely if you leave the product on for longer than directed on the packaging. Some hair types are not removed effectively within the directed timeframe for use therefore patients will leave them on longer. By the time the hair is dissolved the skin is also burnt.\"\n\nKnow your skin \u2014 if it's sensitive, it may be best to stay away from these creams. And, if you do use them, make sure you're removing them thoroughly or you risk developing a \"slow burn.\" Ouch!\n\n5. Electrolysis\n\nDe Fiori says electrolysis has pretty much been replaced by lasers, which are \"faster and more efficacious.\" If you're still devoted to this method, be aware that risks include \"scarring, infection and hyperpigmentation.\"\n\n4. Threading\n\nA lot of women are opting to have their eyebrows and/or the little annoying hairs on their faces removed using threading instead of waxing or shaving. De Fiori says this is the method least likely to damage skin, as it is gentler on skin than tweezing, but it has a major downside: It's only feasible for use on small areas of the skin. Unless, I guess, you're one of few women who love torture and can deal with the insane pain of getting your legs threaded (we won't judge you).\n\nMore: 5 Summer Skin Care Tips Black Women Should Keep in Mind\n\n3. Waxing\n\nBoth De Fiori and Alva are in agreement about waxing, especially when it comes to the eyebrow area: It can cause major skin damage.\n\n\"Waxing removes a top layer of skin every time you use it,\" Alva said, adding that the thin, delicate skin around the eyes has no oil glands and requires as gentle a method as possible. \"It's OK on the body, but it's too rough on skin in the eye area.\"\n\nAlva recommends tweezing, which gives an esthetician more control over your brows and gives you a fuller, more natural brow.\n\nDe Fiori cautions women with rosacea and other inflammatory skin disorders, such as psoriasis and eczema, to avoid waxing altogether because, although it weakens hair growth, it causes hair growth to actually accelerate during the first three to six months, which increases the need to wax more and can lead to hyperpigmentation.\n\n2. Eflornithine hydrochloride cream\n\nWomen who feel they have been plagued by little chin hairs or thick facial hair can now benefit from this effective, but costly, prescription product. After approximately two months of twice daily use, the cream slows down hair growth, according to De Fiori.\n\n\"Some possible, more common side effects are temporary redness, stinging, rash or folliculitis (inflamed, bumpy hair follicles),\" De Fiori said. \"This is a rather expensive product, however it is FDA approved and reduces the need for other hair-removal methods.\"\n\n1. Laser treatments\n\nDing, ding, ding \u2014 I think we have a winner!\n\nDe Fiori says that, although older lasers can damage darker skin tones and weren't effective on very light hair, modern lasers can be used to treat an individual's skin and hair type.\n\nAfter a treatment, hair remains in the skin, but will fall out after four to eight days. And how is this for an incredible added bonus: Depending on the laser used, you may even experience some skin rejuvenation due to the formation of new collagen. A method that removes hair and can fight fine lines? Yes, please.\n\nSo, let's review\n\nModern lasers are De Fiori's preferred method, shaving beats out depilatory creams, waxing should only be used on skin types that do not have a history of reacting to it, and a killer, long-lasting combo worth trying on facial hair: threading and eflornithine hydrochloride cream.\n\nAdios, unwanted hair!\n\nA version of this article was originally published in August 2015."}

{"label": true, "txt": "The actress alleges she was nixed for a role in 'Lord of the Rings' after she rebuffed Weinstein.\n\nA California federal judge on Wednesday has decided that Ashley Judd can move forward in her lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein. However, she will only be able to proceed on defamation and tortious interference claims. A sexual harassment claim has been rejected in the first iteration of the lawsuit.\n\nThe actress alleges in her complaint that she became Weinstein's victim when the movie mogul made demands on her in a hotel room about 20 years ago. Judd says that she only escaped after relenting to a deal where she would let him touch her if she won an Academy Award. Later, Judd says she was in serious discussions for a big role in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings, but that opportunity was torpedoed after Weinstein or someone at Miramax told the director that she was a \"nightmare\" to work with.\n\nIn a ruling on Wednesday, one day after hearing oral arguments on Weinstein's motion to dismiss, U.S. District Court Judge Philip Gutierrez examined whether Judd had brought a timely lawsuit or whether her claims were barred by statute of limitations.\n\nThe actress said she only learned that she was nixed for a role in Lord of the Rings after Jackson recounted what happened in a December 2017 interview. Although Weinstein argued she had a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation, she responded that it was unlikely that a powerful producer and film distributor would reveal something in confidence and disrupt the relationship.\n\nThe judge writes that Judd need only raise a plausible inference at this stage that she would have been unable to learn of Weinstein's statements about her to Jackson.\n\n\"At this point, no evidence has been presented about whether it is common in the industry for actors to inquire into why they were not cast, and further, no evidence has been presented as to whether Jackson and Walsh would have informed Plaintiff about Defendant\u2019s statements had she asked them why she was not given a role in the Lord of the Rings films,\" states the order (read here). \"Taking Plaintiff\u2019s allegations as true \u2014 as the Court must at this stage \u2014 the Court concludes that she has raised a plausible inference that she would not have been able to learn about Defendant\u2019s statements during the limitations period, even if she had conducted a diligent investigation.\"\n\nThe judge also rules that Judd had adequately pled a defamation claim. Weinstein attempted to argue that if he stated that he had \"bad experiences\" with Judd, this amounted to a non-actionable opinion.\n\nJudd \"argues that she can prove these statements false because Defendant had no previous professional interaction with her and her short two-day experience working on the Miramax film Smoke (where she alleges that she did not interact with Defendant) was uniformly positive,\" writes the judge. \"The Court agrees with Plaintiff.\"\n\nAs for Judd's sexual harassment claim, the judge writes that he is skeptical that the statute being invoked (California Civil Code Section 51.9) \"can ever properly be applied to a relationship between a potential employer and a prospective employee.\"\n\nHowever, Gutierrez doesn't make a firm determination on whether a claim of this nature would ever fly. Instead, he looks at Judd's description of her single meeting with Weinstein to ostensibly discuss potential roles in films and finds this doesn't fit the type of relationship of someone providing professional services on an ongoing basis \u2014 something that would actually be susceptible to sexual harassment in the workplace.\n\n\"[Judd] argues that the statute was intended to cover harassment in 'power relationships,' but the statute does not use that term,\" writes the judge, later adding, \"A prospective employee usually either gets the job after an interview or series of interviews (and then becomes covered under sexual harassment laws applicable to employment relationships), or does not get the job, in which case the relationship ends. The temporary nature of a prospective employment relationship is qualitatively different than the often-more-permanent relationships common with the categories of individuals explicitly listed in the statute.\"\n\nJudd tried to position Weinstein's behavior as similar to sexual harassment perpetrated by attorneys, physicians, and teachers \u2014 occupations referenced in the code as examples \u2014 but the judge says that she hasn't alleged the same kind of professional responsibilities on Weinstein's part.\n\nGutierrez does note that the law isn't settled on this point. If this issue eventually gets to an appeal, it could become an important and closely watched one in the #MeToo era.\n\nJudd will have an opportunity to file an amended complaint to try again with her sexual harassment claim.\n\nUpdate:\n\nTheodore Boutrous Jr., attorney for Judd, commented: \"We are very pleased that today the District Court held that Ashley Judd can proceed with her lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein and continue her effort to vindicate the wrongs he committed against her among so many other women. We are also pleased that the court gave us an opportunity to amend our complaint and present additional facts related to one of Ms. Judd's claims. We will move forward immediately with discovery, including Mr. Weinstein's deposition, and look forward to proving to a jury at trial that Mr. Weinstein defamed Ms. Judd, interfered with her ability to earn a living, and engaged in unlawful business practices. The law should not tolerate this abuse of power to damage another's career.\""}

Well, these two actually go way back. \u201cThe Kong: Skull Island\u201d star was asked about the origin of their bond last year on \u201cWatch What Happens Live.\u201d\n\nJackson, 69, and Sheindlin, 75, had mutual friends, meeting through the actor\u2019s agent, Toni Howard. The pair also know each other through Jackson\u2019s lawyer \u2014 \u201cmy lawyer\u2019s husband is the guy who makes her deals,\u201d he said.\n\nAs Jackson recalled, they met at Howard\u2019s house, and they used to smoke cigarettes together. \u201cSo we would sit in Toni\u2019s backyard and smoke, and when Judy stopped smoking, she made me stop smoking. She sent me to her doctor in White Plains, who actually treats you with sodium pentothal, and I quit smoking. But Judy used to get up in the middle of the night to smoke. She\u2019s like, \u2018I used to wake up to smoke.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWWHL\u201d host Andy Cohen asked Jackson if Judge Judy was intimidating, to which he replied, \u201cNo! Judy\u2019s awesome. She\u2019s great. \u2026 I\u2019ve had tea with Judy at the Dorchester in London, and hang out and fly back and forth cross-country with her on planes. Judy\u2019s awesome.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Getty Images Judge Judy and Samuel L. Jackson sharing a laugh.\n\nJackson added, \u201cShe\u2019s straight up clocking dollars.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true \u2014 last year, Forbes ranked Judge Judy No. 8 on its list of America\u2019s Richest Female Entertainers. Her CBS show has been on the air since 1996, and she\u2019s estimated to be worth around $300 million.\n\nIn 2017, \u201cJudge Judy\u201d wrapped its fourth consecutive year as the most-watched syndicated TV show, and it continues to break records left and right. She counts her pal as one of her regular viewers.\n\nJackson revealed on the \u201cToday\u201d show that he includes in his contracts that his trailer on set must have a satellite television so \u201cI can watch judge shows all day when I\u2019m at work \u2026 all of them.\u201d\n\nYes, \u201cJudge Judy\u201d would be one of those \u201cjudge shows,\u201d in case you were wondering. He also praised his BFF on \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\u201d saying he loves watching \u201cJudge Judy\u201d \u201call the time,\u201d adding they get together \u201cat least four or five times a year.\u201d\n\nHey, by Hollywood standards, that\u2019s a lot."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Ben Higgins still hasn't recovered from his breakup with Lauren Bushnell.\n\nThe Bachelor couple went their separate ways last May after a year and a half together, and by December, Higgins thought he was up to find love again on The Bachelor Winter Games. But as Tuesday's episode of The Bachelor spinoff showed, the 29-year-old reality star wasn't ready for romance.\n\n\"To try to engage in relationships here, and know that the last time I did this, it was one of the best moments of my life... my fear is not entering into a relationship. My fear is not pursuing somebody. My fear is that if I were to be broken again, I'm not full enough right now to recover from that,\" Higgins cried in a heart-to-heart with Chris Harrison before packing his bags and heading home.\n\nMonths after filming ended, Higgins has no regrets about leaving the show early, telling ET's Lauren Zima at the Winter Games World: Tells All taping last week that \"it was the right time\" for him to go.\n\n\"I was sitting on the couch and all the couples were making out around me at different places around the living room, and I was like, 'Yeah, I don't think it's my time here anymore.' Like, Yuki and I had too many snowball fights and it's time for me to go,\" he confessed. \"I feel really good about that decision.\"\n\nAnd despite letting the tears flow during his emotional conversation with Harrison, Higgins said the moment didn't come \"from hurt.\"\n\n\"There's moments in this experience that really transcend even reality. There's moments that all of a sudden you're like, 'I haven't been able to express this or communicate this in a year and now I'm doing it on a television show. What in the heck happened?'\" Higgins explained. \"These shows kind of put you in this environment where you really have to dig deep and you have to talk about relationships and love. You start to realize things you never knew you felt, and my emotion was coming from this.\"\n\n\"As soon as [Bushnell and I] broke up, I was getting questions,\" he said, revealing that he read comments from fans asking if he really loved Bushnell, or expressing their wishes that he would have chosen someone else in his finale. \"I was finding myself either protecting Lauren, defending our relationship or having to respond to the fact that they love Lauren. I would say, 'Yeah, I did to. I do to.'\"\n\nBushnell has since moved on with a new man, Devin Antin, but it's not her new relationship that's been hard for Higgins -- because the former Bachelor said he's still been focusing on his own relationship with her.\n\n\"It broke me, because something that was really personal and really real and really hard was something that I also had to relive every day and still do to this day,\" he shared. \"There's not a day that goes by that Lauren isn't brought into my life, and as you're trying to heal from a breakup... it crushes you.\"\n\nMonths earlier, Higgins told ET that he was \"excited\" to fall in love again, and felt \"more ready today than I did two years ago.\" Watch below.\n\nThe finale of The Bachelor Winter Games airs Thursday at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC, with the World Tells All special airing right after.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\n'Bachelor Winter Games' Sneak Peek: Ben Higgins Breaks Down in Tears Over Lauren Bushnell Breakup (Exclusive)\n\n'Bachelor Winter Games': Ben Higgins' Meltdown Sets Off a String of Tearful Goodbyes\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Lauren Bushnell Opens Up About Feeling 'Alone' After Ben Higgins Split, Why She's 'Very Happy' Now"}

Husband-and-wife country music stars Tim McGraw and Faith Hill sat down with Jimmy Fallon and shared the hilarious story of how McGraw wound up meeting his daughter Gracie\u2019s boyfriend. And he couldn\u2019t have planned it better.\n\n\u201cI was on the road working,\u201d the singer told the late-night host. \u201cThey gave me a call and they said, \u2018You know, Gracie\u2019s going out on a date. Do you mind if she goes before you meet the guy?'\u201d\n\nMcGraw joked that he\u2019d already had the Secret Service check out the young man and everything was fine for Gracie go on the date. But once McGraw was back in town the next day, he did want Gracie\u2019s date to stop by just to meet him in person.\n\n\u201cAround noon, I want him to come by the house so I can say hi to him\u2014look him in the eye,\u201d he said.\n\nUpon arriving home, McGraw got busy into his routine and completely forgot about the boyfriend\u2019s visit.

I have a white apron on and a knife and I\u2019m trimming meat up, so I\u2019ve got chunks of meat all over this white apron, blood everywhere. The doorbell rings and I go and answer the door, and here\u2019s this kid who\u2019s dating Gracie standing there.

We\u2019re sure it was the perfect intimidation factor for the young man.\n\nHowever, these parents seem to be pretty big on letting their three daughters learn things on their own. So, even if McGraw hadn\u2019t scared this boyfriend with a knife, the dad probably wouldn\u2019t have gotten in the way of him dating his daughter.\n\nHappy 20th to my sweet, sweet girl.

{"label": true, "txt": "The Duchess of Sussex stepped out for her first solo engagement as a royal today, and she also marked a very important anniversary.\n\nA year ago today, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry made their first public appearance together at a Wheelchair Tennis match at the Invictus Games in Toronto, Markle's former home base. Prior to that, the only confirmation we had of their romance was a statement from Kensington Palace in November 2016.\n\n\n\nThe first official photos of the now-Duke and Duchess of Sussex out together were filled with adorable PDA, cheeky smiles, and genuine warmth. Harry and Meghan looked besotted with one another\u2014and they still do.\n\nGetty Images Chris Jackson\n\nFor Meghan, in particular, the past year has been filled with dramatic changes. Back in September 2017, Meghan was still an actress on Suits and a resident of Toronto, where the show filmed. She still had an Instagram account, which she used regularly, and her lifestyle blog, The Tig. She was also a Twitter user, and regularly posted photos of her friends, vacations, and work life on social media.\n\nBut on November 21, 2017, Meghan's \"normal\" life changed forever when it was reported that the future-Duchess had officially moved to London. At the same time, it was reported that she'd finished all of her filming commitments on Suits, and was moving to England permanently.\n\nDays later, on November 27, 2017, Meghan and Harry announced their engagement. The news was revealed on Kensington Palace's social media accounts, along with a photo from the couple's first public appearance together at the Invictus Games just two months earlier:\n\nThe Prince of Wales has announced the engagement of Prince Harry and Ms. Meghan Markle. pic.twitter.com/rtlAnFCWTf \u2014 Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) November 27, 2017\n\nLater that same day, Meghan and Harry spoke to the BBC about their plans to marry, and it was already clear the actress' life had changed dramatically\u2014and that really loves Prince Harry.\n\nThe very next day, on November 28, 2017, the USA Network revealed that Meghan would officially be leaving Suits at the end of Season 7.\n\nBreaking with royal tradition, Meghan spent Christmas with the royals, proving that she was already considered a part of the family. The Queen reportedly waived her rule regarding only spouses attending the festive celebrations, allowing Meghan to attend as Harry's fianc\u00e9e.\n\nShortly after Christmas, in early January 2018, Meghan deleted her online presence\u2014including lifestyle website The Tig, her Instagram, and her Twitter account. As she was about to officially join the royal family, she appeared to be making more of her personal life private, in keeping with her soon-to-be husband's own practices.\n\nExcitement about the royal wedding consumed the first few months of 2018, with Meghan and Harry tying the knot at Windsor Castle on May 19. In a custom Givenchy gown, Meghan officially became the Duchess of Sussex. The former actress incorporated many American touches into the royal wedding, signaling that she has not forgotten her heritage.\n\nGetty Images WPA Pool\n\nAlmost a month after the royal wedding, Meghan made her very first solo outing with Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Harry's grandmother. The duo appeared to get along very well, and their outing, without any other members of the royal family, showed the immense amount of faith the royals already had in Meghan.\n\nGetty Images Max Mumby/Indigo\n\nA slew of royal events later, Meghan is attending her first solo event as a royal, exactly one year after she first stepped out publicly with Prince Harry. With her and Harry's first royal tour due to start next month\u2014during which they'll travel to Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, and Tonga\u2014it's clear that the Duchess of Sussex's life will continue to evolve rapidly.\n\nBut her first year in the royal spotlight proves Meghan will handle every new change with aplomb."}

{"label": true, "txt": "This year marks the 20th anniversary of one of Disney's first ever original movies, and a fan favorite, Halloweentown. The original movie went on to spawn three sequels - Halloweentown II: Kalabar's Revenge, Halloweentown High, and Return to Halloweentown. Fans love to rewatch these movies every year around Halloween, and Disney still plays them on its channel to this day. What is so special about Halloweentown that makes fans keep coming back for more?\n\nThere are so many things to love about the Halloweentown movies. There's the nostalgia, the not-so-high-tech special effects, and the all around family Halloween fun. Debbie Reynolds, of course, shines in her role as Aggie, the magical witch grandmother to Marnie, Dylan, and Sophie. Marnie, played by Kimberly J. Brown (until she was recast in the fourth film with Sarah Paxton) is a massive fan favorite as well. To this day, Brown is asked about her time in the Halloweentown movies, and even revisits the real Halloweentown once in a while with her castmates.\n\nEvery film set comes with obstacles, but bringing the monster-filled Halloweentown to life was no easy feat. We'll take a look at behind-the-scenes secrets the cast and crew has shared over the years. Brown especially has revealed tons of fun facts about the making of the Halloweentown movies in her own personal videos. We love when actors are just as obsessed with their films as we are, and this is one cast that loves their legacy.\n\nHere are 20 Crazy Details Behind The Making Of The Halloweentown Movies.\n\n20 Benny the taxi driver was a robot\n\nOne of the most iconic characters from Halloweentown is definitely Benny the skeleton taxi driver. He is one of the first monsters that Marnie, Dylan, and Sofie meet in Halloweentown, and he is a recurring character throughout the franchise.\n\nWhen asked about how working with Benny was, Kimberly J. Brown - who plays Marnie - revealed that he was actually a robot. \"The actor dubbed his lines after filming, so we actually worked with a robot,\" Brown recalls, \"I\u2019ll always remember the \u2018errr err\u2019 sound it made.\" Knowing this detail makes it even funnier looking back on their scenes together. Marnie and her siblings always look pretty confused when they're with Benny-- now we know why!\n\n19 The budget was cut from $30 million to $4 million\n\nWhen director Duwayne Dunham was presented the script for Halloweentown, he had no idea what he was in for. \"I read it and I thought, 'Holy smokes, this is big, I mean really big,'\" he recalls. Disney agreed, admitting that the film would have to be cut down significantly in order to be made.\n\nDunham began with a budget of $20 to $30 million, and by the time everything was cut, they were down to a $4 million budget. This was no small cut-back, and Dunham had to get creative with ways to stretch the budget. It wasn't easy, but they made it work. \"I met with the writers and we started going through it,\" Dunham said. It took weeks to finally get the film to match the budget. Halloweentown was filmed in only 24 days.\n\n18 There was almost a different ending\n\nWhile the first Halloweentown movie has a happy ending where Marnie and the Cromwells save Halloweentown, originally the ending wasn't so simple. In fact, it was pretty dark.\n\nIn the ending we all know and love, Marnie places the talisman inside the giant pumpkin that resides in the middle of Halloweentown. For the alternate ending, Marnie was to place the talisman in the middle of a magical forest. As Marnie walked through the forest, she grew older and older with each step.\n\nEven though the ending was scrapped, they got so far as making a mold of Marnie's head in order to achieve the effect. Since the ending was not used after all, Kimberly J. Brown ended up keeping the headpiece for herself.\n\n17 Kimberly J. Brown took a mold of her own head from set.\n\nBoth the cast and crew took a few mementos from the Halloweentown set. With an elaborate like that, how could you not?\n\nKimberly J. Brown,who played Marnie, says she still has a broom from set, and strangely enough, a mold of her own head!\n\nDirector Duwayne Dunham admits to having a pretty cool piece of memorabilia as well. \"We had a stained glass worker there,\" Dunham recalls,\"[I have] a stained glass picture of a black cat with an arched back and kind of an orange moon.\" The coolest part is that his kids love it to this day, and they put it out each Halloween. \"I set that in the window and I put a light behind it,\" Dunham said, \"that\u2019s my beacon to Halloweentown.\"\n\n16 Kalabar's spell was improvised\n\nWhile shooting Halloweentown II: Kalabar's Revenge, Daniel Kountz got quite the surprise when it came time to conjure the portal to Halloweentown. Kountz, who plays Kal, Kalabar's son, had to make up his own spell at the last minute. The script reads \u201cKal says spell and walks through the portal,\u201d Kountz told MTV. He assumed that he would be given a spell to say, but this wasn't the case.\n\nWhen asked on set if he had prepared a spell, Kountz lied and said yes, then quickly scrambled to make something up.\n\nBelieve it or not, he got inspiration from a choir song he learned in school. \u201cI just pulled that out of nowhere, and they ended up using it,\" Kountz recalls, \"and I think it actually worked out pretty well.\"\n\n15 Real flames shot from Marnie's hair dryer\n\nIn a world of modern technology, we've gotten used to most effects being done with CGI technology or motion capture. Back in the 1990s, on a film set with a very small budget, things had to be done differently. Kimberly J. Brown let us in on this fun fact about the hair salon scene.\n\n\"I actually had to stand with a hair dryer and real flames shot out of it, and it was very hot,\" Brown recalled. Was it a good idea for a child to hold a hair dryer blowing flames? Brown seems to think so, adding, \"it was very safe, and very fun.\"\n\n14 Halloweentown is actually St. Helens, Oregon\n\nIf you're wondering where Halloweentown was filmed, it wasn't just on a Disney lot. In fact, the real world town of St. Helen's, Oregon is where it all began. The cast and crew absolutely loved it there, because it really felt like stepping into another world.\n\nKimberly J. Brown remembers it fondly to this day, saying,\"it was the perfect location, with a town square and everything.\" Director Duwayne Dunham loved the location because of how easy it was to film in. He called it, \"basically an abandoned town\" that was an \"ideal place\" for the film. Dunham also fell in love with the color scheme of St. Helens, and admits they got lucky, seeing as how the film budget was so small.\n\n13 They had to reuse extras\n\nThe small budget was a huge obstacle throughout filming. From special effects, to the number of takes they could afford, to the amount of people they had on set - everything had to be planned meticulously. Dunham remembers how they made it seem like more monsters were roaming around Halloweentown than were actually present. \"We had just enough [extras], and we would double up and change costumes and make it look like there were more and different people and that sort of thing,\" Duhman told MTV.\n\nIt seems like the Halloweentown extras really earned their pay on this film.\n\nLuckily for Dunham, he was working with a great group of people. \"Everybody really pitched in and everybody was really on board with what we were doing, so there was never any grumbling.\"\n\n12 Robin Thomas lost his voice for a week on set\n\nWhile everyone in the cast gave it their all, Robin Thomas, who played Kalabar, actually gave his voice for his role! Granted, he only lost it for about a week, but that's still a big price to pay when you're an actor. Thomas remembers the crazy conditions in which he had to shoot his epic City Hall ending scene, and how loud he had to yell.\n\nWith no body mic, or mic of any kind, Thomas found himself having to pull out all the stops. He remembers it vividly, saying, \"I was having to project my voice down. There were fans. [I was] 150 feet or so from the camera. That was challenging. I blew my pipes out.\" Thankfully Halloweentown became a cult classic, so Thomas's voice didn't go to waste!\n\n11 High School Musical stars were in Halloweentown High\n\nTwo years before High School Musical became a Disney Channel original sensation, two of its stars found a home in Halloweentown as well.\n\nYou may know Olesya Rulin best as Kelsi, the quiet yet lovable pianist from High School Musical.\n\nFirst she was everyone's favorite pink troll in Halloweentown High. Rulin played Marnie's brother Dylan's love interest, until they just decided to be friends in the end.\n\nAnother notable High School Musical star who ended up appearing in two Halloweentown films is Lucas Grabeel. In Halloweentown High, he played Ethan the Warlock, and he was also appeared in Return to Halloweentown the same year High School Musical was released. Apparently Disney likes to keep it all in the family!\n\n10 Debbie Reynolds' impact on set\n\nWhen asked to reflect on Debbie Reynolds after her passing, all members of the cast agreed that she was the life of the set. Everyone remembers her fondly for always being in a good mood and wanting to help in any way. \"She\u2019s just very giving and wanted everybody to shine as brightly as they could,\" recalls director Duwayne Dunham.\n\nKimberly J. Brown stayed close with Reynolds even after the third film wrapped. She has also kept a memento from her, telling Bustle, \"I actually have a note from her that she gave me when we wrapped the third movie that I\u2019ve had framed all of these years.\"\n\n9 Kimberly J. Brown did not want to be recast as Marnie\n\nWhen Marnie was recast for the fourth film in the franchise, Return to Halloweentown, fans were very displeased. It spawned loads of memes on the internet, poking fun at Disney for thinking that we wouldn't notice or care that they recast the main character. In a candid interview, Kimberly J. Brown made it very clear that she did not want to be recast as Marnie.\n\n\"I wanted to do the fourth one and was fully available for the shoot,\" Brown said.\n\n\"Nothing makes me happier than playing Marnie. Disney decided not to use me for the fourth one, I don\u2019t know why. I was definitely disappointed not to do it.\" If fans weren't already angry, they are now! Rumored scheduling conflicts were said to be the reason Brown was recast, but it seems that wasn't the case.\n\n8 Halloweentown High and Luck of the Irish were filmed at the same school\n\nWhile Disney may be one of the biggest production companies in the world, that doesn't mean the studio is above reusing shooting locations as much as possible. This was the case for the high school where Halloweentown High was filmed. Halloweentown High, the third film in the franchise, was actually shot in the same high school as another Disney Channel original movie, The Luck of the Irish.\n\nThis is especially apparent when we see Aggie, played by Debbie Reynolds, teaching basketball during gym class. It is clearly the same gym where we see the main character Kyle and his team play in The Luck of the Irish. Both scenes involve basketball too! There are many shots where you can see the same lockers and classrooms as well.\n\n7 Only two actors starred in all four films\n\nWhile Debbie Reynolds did make an appearance as grandma Aggie in Return to Halloweentown, it was very brief. There are only two actors who returned to their parts full-force in the fourth film, and those are Judith Hoag who plays Gwen, and Joey Zimmerman who plays her son Dylan. As we all know, Marnie was recast. Emily Roeske also did not return as Sophie.\n\nThe storyline tries to maintain connections to the past three films, but ultimately Return to Halloweentown feels like an entirely different world.\n\nThanks to the larger presence of Judith Hoag and her own separate storyline, as well as Zimmerman accompanying our new Marnie - Sarah Paxton - to Witch College, the sentiment of the original movies was kept somewhat intact. They even cast a professor who has a striking resemblance to Reynolds.\n\n6 Halloweentown was shot during a sweltering summer\n\nWhen filming a movie this big, sometimes you have to deal with unexpected elements - one of those being the weather. Halloweentown was shot in July of 1998, so everyone was expecting it to be hot, but not as hot as it was.\n\nIt turned out being one of the hottest summers St. Helen's, Oregon ever had.\n\nJoey Zimmerman, who plays Marnie's brother Dylan, said that the townspeople had it worst. \"People were passing out,\" Zimmerman recalls, \"the fish guy mask, and the crazy alien mask\" all made for very hot costumes. Even some of the main cast, like Debbie Reynolds, who almost always wears long velvet robes in the film, had it tough as well.\n\n5 Kimberly J. Brown had input on the 3rd film\n\nThough Kimberly J. Brown may have been recast for the fourth Halloweentown film, she will forever be the original Marnie. Not only does she love the movies just as much as we do, but she really cares about the fans. For these reasons, Brown wanted to get involved in the storyline for the third film, Halloweentown High, to make sure that there was continuity between all of the films.\n\n\"We had a new writer with the third movie so they were nice enough to let me have a little bit of input,\" Brown told Seventeen. Brown loves the characters, and said that being involved behind-the-scenes was important to her. We're glad Brown put her own special touch into the story while she was still our Marnie.\n\n4 A \"Spirit of Halloweentown\" bash is thrown every year\n\nWhat's better than watching Halloweentown? How about actually visiting Halloweentown - St. Helen's, Oregon - where a \"Spirit of Halloweentown\" bash has been thrown for years. The party is to honor the Halloweentown movies, and what better place than where it all started?\n\nKimberly J. Brown, and even Debbie Reynolds have reunited at the \"Spirit of Halloweentown\" bash along with other cast members over the years.\n\nThousands of fans show up in hopes of seeing their favorite characters every year, and even just to see the town and the real-life places that were used for the movie. The festivities run for a week in October.\n\n3 The Halloweentown book is real\n\nIn the first Halloweentown film, Marnie, Dylan, and Sofie are introduced to Halloweentown through a book. When grandmother Aggie reads them the Halloweentown story for bedtime, we see a drawing of a witch that looks just like Marnie.\n\nKimberly J. Brown revealed that these books were specially made for the movie, and are, in fact, entirely finished books. \"They had an artist draw that picture of me too so it would look a little like me,\" she recalls. \"It really is a beautiful book! But there are only a few copies made for the shoot.\" Now we're just curious about who has these few, coveted copies!\n\n2 It was one of the first Disney Channel Original movies\n\nHalloweentown is more than just a fan favorite around the Halloween season, it was actually one of the first ever Disney Channel original movies ever made! Director Duwayne Dunham remembers the process of getting the film up and running. It was during a time when Disney Channel was just starting to make their own movies, originally Halloweentown was going to be a film for NBC.\n\n\"Disney Channel had just started production on their first movie, which was 'Brink,'\" Dunham recalls. Interestingly enough, Dunham actually wanted to direct Brink, but \"they offered me Halloweentown\" he said, \"and Halloweentown was huge.\" While Halloweentown may have been the second ever to go into production, by the time it came out it was actually the fourth ever Disney Channel original to be released.\n\n1 The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles connection\n\nSometimes the perks of being an actor include meeting your idols on set. This happened with Joey Zimmerman when he found out Judith Hoag would be playing his mother.\n\nZimmerman is a big fan of the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which Hoag starred in.\n\nThe funniest part? He waited until after Halloweentown was done filming to tell her what a big fan he is! \"I wanted to be a professional, so I waited until after filming the entire first movie before exploding about TMNT,\" Zimmerman recalls. When he found out that there would be more Halloweentown movies, he said that \"doing the sequels was like winning some kind of lottery.\" He looked forward to any scene with Hoag.\n\n---\n\nWhat's your favorite making of Halloweentown fact? Let us know in the comments!"}
{"label": true, "txt": "The Big Three turned 37 and a major piece fell into place regarding Jack\u2019s death, but the Season 2 premiere succeeded because it didn\u2019t try to recreate the past.\n\n[Editor\u2019s Note: The following review contains spoilers for the \u201cThis Is Us\u201d Season 2 premiere, Episode 1, \u201cMy Father\u2019s Advice.\u201d]\n\nWhen \u201cThis Is Us\u201d premiered, it not only took the nation by storm, but quickly established a reputation for being a twist-driven family drama. The pilot pulled off a major last-second reveal \u2014 that Randall (Sterling K. Brown), Kate (Chrissy Metz), and Kevin (Justin Hartley) were all children of Jack (Milo Ventimiglia) and Rebecca (Mandy Moore) \u2014 and permanently hooked an audience who was already wooed by the emotional melodrama driving each individual story. With each new episode came the expectation for another twist, another secret, another layer to be revealed.\n\nBut as the season progressed, that expectation grew tiring. The characters were so full of life, the plots didn\u2019t need to depend on any flashback reveals or present-day shocks. The best episodes played out naturally, like \u201cMemphis,\u201d when Randall\u2019s biological father passed away during a road trip to his hometown. Viewers came to understand William\u2019s (Ron Cephas Jones, who made a nice cameo in the Season 2 premiere) backstory, but it wasn\u2019t shared to pull the rug out from the present; just to enhance it.\n\nThe Season 2 premiere arrived Tuesday night, for better or worse, with light pressure to recreate the magic from Season 1 \u2014 including the final twist \u2014 but there\u2019s only one big question left: How did Jack die? We\u2019ve known he passed away when the kids were young for a long time, and the persistent query has been pushed again and again by fans and the media. Though Episode 1 didn\u2019t answer the big question in its entirety, \u201cThis Is Us\u201d flashed forward to the day Jack died and gave just enough of a taste that maybe people will stop asking for a bit. Better yet, the episode showed greater maturity in setting up multiple upcoming stories, all of which look ready to play out without manipulation.\n\nSuch growth is fitting given the episode took place on the Big Three\u2019s 37th birthday. Randall celebrates by taking his wife to a meeting with an adoption agent. Kate and Toby (Chris Sullivan) are planning a double date with Kevin and his girlfriend (/ex-wife), Sophie (Alexandra Breckenridge), but only after she auditions for a singing gig. And all this is framed by the tumultuous state of Jack and Rebecca\u2019s relationship, only a day after their ruthless fight in the Season 1 finale.\n\nAs usual, Randall\u2019s story is the best. Beth\u2019s (Susan Kelechi Watson) hesitancy toward adoption is quickly and earnestly addressed instead of dragged out for multiple episodes. As soon as the husband makes a misstep by telling his wife she \u201cneeds to get her head around\u201d what he wants, Randall apologizes with the sincerity and passion only a \u201cperfect\u201d couple could create with any form of authenticity. Yes, their mini-fight was just to set up a sterling speech by Brown, but that\u2019s OK; that\u2019s why a lot of people tune in, and if you have an actor of Brown\u2019s (Emmy-winning) abilities, let him loose on lines like these. He can handle it.\n\nPlus, it moves the story forward, incrementally but believably, to the couple adopting an older child. It\u2019s the kind of baby step we want to see, both in a challenge facing our iron-clad couple and in their slow build toward growth.\n\nKate, meanwhile, is a bit of a guessing game. Her entire arc began as nothing but stalling. The tension between her boyfriend and brother was obvious from the start, and it took until episode\u2019s end for them to address it. Her bailing on the audition is another stretch, as there\u2019s barely a good reason for her to do it. Is her timidity plausible? Sure, but it bogs down the story more than it adds to her character.\n\nThat being said, if it was all so Kate could be called out for only talking about her weight, it\u2019s all worth it. Too many of Kate\u2019s stories focused on her weight in Season 1, so much so that the audience barely knew anything else about her. So, if the band leader proves not everything is about her weight, thus pushing her on an exploration of her talent, passion, and commitment, then her plot line would be the most valuable of the entire episode. Kate deserves to do far more than she\u2019s been allowed to thus far, and if this is how Season 2 sets up a year of non-weight-related arcs, bring it on.\n\nKevin, who creator Dan Fogelman has repeatedly promised will shock people in Season 2, didn\u2019t get the chance just yet. A Ron Howard cameo and a sweet surprise from Sophie to end the episode couldn\u2019t quite make his story stand out, but it wasn\u2019t supposed to; someone has to play the supporting role, and Kevin did so well, yet again, in the premiere.\n\nThat only leaves Jack and Rebecca, and their storyline survived more than a few scares. The first came when it was unveiled that Randall walked in on his parents\u2019 epic fight from the Season 1 finale. The heartbreaking revelation could still come up again later on, but here it subtly informed why Randall sees his mom\u2019s interpretation of her first marriage as rose-colored. He saw what they said behind close doors, and he knows he never wants that for his marriage. So when he starts to edge closer to his father\u2019s worse tendencies \u2014 bossing around his wife \u2014 he retreats. It motivates him to give his \u201cperfect, imperfect\u201d speech, and better informs Randall\u2019s character.\n\nThe other traps in Jack and Rebecca\u2019s plot were nimbly avoided. Think about the opportunities for emotional manipulation: Jack revealing he\u2019s drunk to his wife, right when she asks him to come home, could\u2019ve been played up to an obnoxious degree. Instead, he just said it. He told her, which was rewarding because we got to see Jack accept responsibility (reinforcing his reputation as the perfect man), but it got right to the heart of the matter.\n\nRebecca, in turn, did the same. Though the cut to black after Jack closed the door was a little much, Rebecca making him come home felt like the right step. \u201cThat\u2019s not us,\u201d she says, after he shut her out. The line, an inverse of the show\u2019s title, defines the couple \u2014 and the show \u2014 as one not built on disconnect, but intimate understanding, acceptance, and honesty. Just as Rebecca needs to work through things directly with Jack, the show needs to tackle its tales head-on \u2014 as it did repeatedly in Episode 1.\n\nHer choice moves the story quickly toward a revelation that we now know is only a few months away. Jack\u2019s death is imminent, and while the episode shared a few more clues (or red herrings) toward what will happen before we find out the cause of the fire \u2014 Kevin\u2019s cast, Rebecca\u2019s Steelers\u2019 Jersey, Randall\u2019s girlfriend \u2014 they weren\u2019t laid out like twists. It felt more like preparation, preparation the audience very much needs after all this build up.\n\n\u201cThis Is Us\u201d remains an occasionally cloying melodrama, but the Season 2 premiere exhibited honest emotional reactions much more than manipulated ones. Better yet, it\u2019s set up a season that should do the same. Happy second birthday, \u201cThis Is Us.\u201d You\u2019re growing up just fast enough.\n\nGrade: B+\n\n\u201cThis Is Us\u201d airs new episodes Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET on NBC."}

{"label": true, "txt": "CLOSE Actor Anthony Edwards has revealed that he is a survivor of sexual assault. Edwards claims Gary Goddard, a well-known theatrical director, producer, and theme park designer, sexually abused him when Edwards was a young teenager. USA TODAY\n\nAnthony Edwards, best known for playing Dr. Mark Greene on TV's 'ER,' says he was molested for years by entertainment-industry veteran Gary Goddard. (Photo: NBC)\n\nActor Anthony Edwards accused writer/producer Gary Goddard of molesting him in an essay that was published on Medium Friday.\n\nEdwards says he first met Goddard when he was 12, at the beginning of his acting career, which included roles in films like 1982's Fast Times at Ridgemont High and 1984's Revenge of the Nerds. He is best known for the 1986 film Top Gun and the NBC medical drama ER, in which he played Dr. Mark Greene from 1994 to 2008.\n\nGary Goddard Entertainment founder, Gary Goddard, is seen in his North Hollywood office in this Jan. 15, 2015 file photo. (Photo: Bob Chamberlin, LA Times via Getty Images)\n\nThe actor, now 55, said Goddard, 63, taught him \"the value of acting,\" and served as a leader for Edwards' group of friends. Edwards says Goddard also used the void of his emotionally unavailable father to manipulate him.\n\n\"Everyone has the need to bond, and I was no exception,\" said Edwards. \"My vulnerability was exploited. I was molested by Goddard, my best friend was raped by him \u2014 and this went on for years. The group of us, the gang, stayed quiet.\"\n\nGoddard directed the 1987 live-action He-Man film Masters of the Universe. He later founded the Goddard Group, an entertainment design firm. It produced 2009's Tony Award-winning revival of the musical Hair as well as several theme-park attractions for Universal Studios and Six Flags.\n\nEdwards wrote, \"Only after I was able to separate my experience, process it, and put it in its place could I accept this truth: My abuse may always be with me, but it does not own me.\" (Photo: FREDERICK M. BROWN/GETTY IMAGES)\n\nEdwards said that he came face to face with Goddard at an airport 22 years ago and was able to confront his alleged abuser.\n\n\"I was able to express my outrage at what he had done,\" he wrote. \"He swore to his remorse and said that he had gotten help. I felt a temporary sense of relief. I say temporary because when Goddard appeared in the press four years ago for alleged sexual abuse, my rage resurfaced. At 51 years old, I was directed by a group of loving friends to a therapist who specializes in this kind of abuse.\"\n\nEdwards was likely referring to a pair of 2014 lawsuits accusing Goddard of sexually abusing teenage males. One suit was brought by an anonymous British citizen; the other was filed in federal court in Hawaii by Michael Egan III, who eventually withdrew his complaint against Goddard.\n\nThe ER star continued, \"Only after I was able to separate my experience, process it, and put it in its place could I accept this truth: My abuse may always be with me, but it does not own me.\"\n\nHe concluded, \"I did not go from being a victim to a survivor alone. No one does. I had to ask for help, and I am so grateful that I did.\"\n\nGoddard's press representative Sam Singer put out a statement late Friday \"unequivocally\" denying Edward's charges.\n\n\u201cGary first met Anthony more than 40 years ago. Gary was a mentor, teacher and a friend to Anthony, which makes this story all the more disturbing to him,\" Singer said in a statement. \"As to the allegations that Mr. Edwards made in his post today, I can unequivocally deny them on Gary\u2019s behalf. Gary played an important role in helping start Anthony\u2019s acting career and acted as his personal manager. He has nothing but the greatest respect for Anthony as a person.\"\n\nSinger added: \"Gary is saddened by the false allegations. The post by Anthony, as well as many of the news stories today reference a legal claim made against Gary approximately four years ago regarding sexual harassment. The complaint was demonstrated to be fraudulent as it was completely fabricated, and ultimately withdrawn by the complainant and his attorneys.\u201d\n\nGoddard's current project, the film Broadway 4D, which he wrote and co-directed with Bryan Singer, is due next year.\n\nYou can read Edwards' essay in its entirety here.\n\nMore: Louis C.K. apologizes for his sexual misconduct: 'These stories are true'\n\nMore: Kevin Spacey scandal: A complete list of the 14 accusers\n\nMore: List: All of the Hollywood power players accused of sexual assault or harassment\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2i0mJMo"}

The song I wrote was about a past relationship. \u2764.\"\n\nThe song in question is Haynes' new acoustic demo, \"Man It Sucks,\" which a number of fans assumed was about his alleged relationship problems with Leatham. \"Man it sucks / When someone figures out your games and don't wanna play 'em no more / We're crying in our bed and making our way to the floor / Man it sucks,\" the actor sings on the track. \"And I don't like when you're staying out all night and never answer your phone / I follow you around the world just to be left alone / And man it sucks.\"\n\nRumors that the couple had called it quits began to circulate earlier in the week after the two notably unfollowed one another on Instagram. Additionally, Haynes deleted photos of himself with Leatham on the social media platform, removed \"husband\" from his bio, and changed his username from \"Colton Haynes-Leatham\" to \"Colton Haynes.\"\n\n\"Jeff and Colton have been having relationship issues since a couple months after the wedding,\" an Us Weekly source said at the time. \"Since Colton stopped talking to a lot of his old friends, he was getting really depressed and didn't feel like himself.\"\n\nHaynes, 29, and Leatham, 46, married in a star-studded ceremony officiated by Kris Jenner in Palm Springs, Calif. in October 2017. As Nicki Swift previously reported, Haynes proposed to Leatham in May of that year \u2014 just a few months after the celebrity florist had popped the question himself. The duo first went public with their romance that February.\n\nAt the time of this writing, nether party has publicly commented on their current relationship status."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Tina Fey and Robert Carlock's complicated Netflix comedy took a big swing with an offhand joke, but reminded us just how important this character's journey is.\n\n[Editor\u2019s note: Spoilers for Season 3 of \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d follow.]\n\nThe most important, intriguing, and controversial moment of \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d Season 3 happens so fast that you might have missed it: In Episode 3, \u201cKimmy Can\u2019t Help You!,\u201d Kimmy Schmidt (Ellie Kemper) finally uses the word \u201crape\u201d in reference to her 15 years spent stuck underground as the prisoner of Reverend Richard Wayne Gary Wayne (Jon Hamm).\n\nREAD MORE: \u2018Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u2019 Season 3 Review: Kimmy Goes to College, Tackles the Patriarchy, and Gets Stronger\n\nSpecifically, here\u2019s what happens: Wendy (very special guest star Laura Dern) has come to Kimmy and Titus\u2019s apartment with a set of divorce papers, as she and the Reverend are hoping to get married, but Kimmy and the Reverend are still legally man and wife.\n\nWendy doesn\u2019t reveal right away that she\u2019s hoping to marry the Reverend, but quickly we discover that this otherwise normal-seeming woman has, at the very least, a very poor understanding of what kind of monster \u201cRichard\u201d is, something that pisses Kimmy off \u2014 and may be why she (and the show) crossed a line they\u2019ve up until now avoided.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of sophisticated, if you think about it,\u201d Wendy practically giggles. \u201cAn evening in Manhattan with my lover\u2019s wife. It sounds like a Noel Coward play.\u201d\n\nSnaps Kimmy in reply: \u201cIf Noel Coward was really a coward who rapes everybody.\u201d\n\nFrom the beginning of the series, creators Tina Fey and Robert Carlock have hinted at some of the darker elements of Kimmy\u2019s abduction and imprisonment, most notably with this line in the pilot: \u201cYes, there was weird sex stuff in the bunker.\u201d Otherwise, the show has shown a preference for show over tell, specifically in how Kimmy\u2019s trauma interferes with her attempts to pursue any sort of romantic relationship.\n\nKimmy\u2019s love interests have included several nice gentlemen over the past three seasons, such as tutor Charles (Andrew Ridings), rich guy Logan (Adam Campbell), Vietnamese immigrant Dong (Ki Hong Lee), PTSD-afflicted veteran Keith (Sam Page), and this season, the lovely Daveed Diggs as philosophy student Perry. All of them have initially seemed like a potential fit for Kimmy, and all of them haven\u2019t worked out \u2013 much of the time because when she finds herself in an intimate situation, Kimmy\u2019s instinctual reaction is to lash out with violence in order to protect herself.\n\nAt times, Kimmy\u2019s over-the-top physical reaction to these moments is played for comedy, to a degree where it\u2019s a bit uncomfortable to watch her constantly slamming telephones on Dong\u2019s head as he attempts to kiss her.\n\nAnd of all her love interests, Dong is the one she\u2019s gone furthest with. While they struggle to connect in Season 2 Episode 8, \u201cKimmy Goes To A Hotel,\u201d the final scene indicates that as they\u2019re trapped in the back of a police car, Kimmy finally feels capable of pursuing more with him. \u201cYou\u2019re in handcuffs, which is making my brain feel calm for more totally normal reasons\u2026\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s never going to be perfect.\u201d\n\nThat last comment feels like a nice overall statement for what life is like as a survivor of trauma, and \u201cKimmy Schmidt\u201d has always been sure to keep an element of humanity in its exploration of what Kimmy\u2019s time in the bunker did to her as a person. It\u2019s also one of the trickiest hurdles the show has had to navigate, because the established tone of a light, bubbly comedy about a woman who now fully admits to over a decade of rape and abuse is at times a real brain-teaser.\n\nOne interesting twist came in Season 3, Episode 11, \u201cKimmy Googles the Internet!\u201d \u2014 in which Kimmy learned that many of the people in her life are more than aware of her mole woman past, thanks to Google. It\u2019s a harsh moment of awareness for the character, as her relative na\u00efvet\u00e9 when it comes to technology has kept her shielded from the fact that so much of our lives can be hunted down with some strategic search engine terms.\n\nBut it also led to a character arc that honestly felt a little formless, but still intriguing. Season 1 was about Kimmy confronting what, exactly, happened to her. Season 2 was about acknowledging she needed help and getting it. But Season 3 was about her working to own that experience, rather than hide it.\n\nAnd a big part of that? Finally using the \u201cR-word.\u201d It\u2019s unlikely that \u201cKimmy Schmidt\u201d will ever push past a PG-13 rating, despite its subject matter and Netflix\u2019s loose content restrictions \u2014 Tina Fey has said that she likes that families can still watch the show together. But now that the show is slightly more comfortable with being honest about what happened to Kimmy, maybe she, and the show, can actually move on in a real, healthy way.\n\n\u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d has done a lovely job over the past three seasons of creating its own little world. There\u2019s plenty to explore still as Kimmy fills her Google results with what she does now \u2014 not so much burying what was done to her, but proving that as a female who\u2019s \u201cstrong as hell,\u201d she\u2019s far more than that one experience.\n\n\u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d Season 3 is streaming now on Netflix.\n\nStay on top of the latest film and TV news!

Painted as a bit of a bad boy bartender on this series set at a hot gay bar in West Hollywood, Clarke is embroiled in a reality love affair with castmate Marissa Chykirda (maybe) and he loves his momma and his little dog Koda like nobody\u2019s business.\n\nClarke is whip-smart and thoughtful despite what we have seen in a previous episode where he dismissed fellow castmate Elizabeth Steinle at a charity event which caused her to melt down.\n\nDespite a two-week frost, Kyle and Liz have since worked out their issues and now are on solid footing as friends, a testament to the natural coaching abilities and maturity this uber-fit veteran brings to a cast of sometimes childish up-and-comers.\n\nEnthusiastic about health and longevity, Clarke tells how he trained his 65+-year-old dad to get his abdominal muscles ready for a cover shoot and how he is in it for the long game, wanting to take his devotion to nutrition and holistic health to the masses as he builds his brand and fame.\n\nWe spoke to Kyle about his role as the adult of the cast and his plans for fitness world domination:\n\nMonsters and Critics: Kyle, how did you come to the Abbey as an employee?\n\nKyle Clarke: I moved to LA about 6 years ago, right when I got here and because I did so much work in the fitness industry, people were like, \u2018Oh, you should work at the Abbey\u2019 and I had never been there before. After a couple of years, I work for a supplement company and I\u2019m with them on salary, but I am basically paid to develop products, do their marketing, and stay in shape to do all of the photo shoots.\n\nSo I wasn\u2019t really interacting with people too much, and I was kind of losing my people skills. When I was going on auditions I felt super awkward around people. I want to go more often, but I don\u2019t want to drink, so I considered this bartending job, I am out and not drinking but I am making money and I am having fun. Where should I go?\n\nI\u2019ve always been told I should work at the Abbey, so I drove down there and was really nervous because I had never been inside, it\u2019s like the number one gay bar in the world and I was like, \u2018oh man I\u2019m about to walk ito this place and ask for a job,\u2019 but I walked in, asked for a job and they said \u2018we can\u2019t hire you because you\u2019ve never been to our establishment.\u2019\n\nI sat down at the bar and all the regulars began talking to me, asking my story, where I was from and all of a sudden the general manager came back over to me and said, \u2018Alright, come in on Thursday night, if you can handle Thursday, we\u2019ll hire you on Friday.\u2019\n\nI walked in on a Tuesday and was hired on a Friday, that never happens at the Abbey. Usually, they are never hiring, other people who have worked there have been there 10, 15, 20 years\u2026\n\nM&C: Yet the cast of the show seems very young\u2026\n\nKC: Right, I think I am the oldest castmate of the show.\n\nM&C: Your dad is in amazing shape, you have a photo of him on Facebook, can you talk about your father and your relationship?\n\nKC: Thank you, I come from an incredible family, My parents are both overly involved in me and my sister\u2019s life. Once we went away to college\u2026they just wanted the best for us so they did it out of love. When we went to college they kind of backed off as parents and became good friends and mentors and good role models for our lives.\n\nI\u2019ve always been closer with my mom. But lately, my relationship with my dad has improved tremendously. He was a captain in the Marine Corps. He was more badass than I was. He was a fighter pilot in the Marines. He flew F-4 Phantoms, he was the real Top Gun! He did that so I wanted to be a captain as well. I went into the military and was a captain in the army, it bonded me with my dad.\n\nM&C: Was he disappointed you didn\u2019t become a Marine?\n\nKC: No, it didn\u2019t. It disappointed me that I didn\u2019t become a Marine! [laughs] I wanted to become a Marine but the college I went to had Army on the base. I had a full-ride scholarship from the U.S. Army, to attend Washington University in St. Louis, MO. (he received his Bachelors of Science in Civil Engineering) and you had to go Navy and then Marine Corps. option.\n\nYou had to go into the Navy and hopefully get that option. I didn\u2019t want to [go Navy] and be stuck on a ship somewhere. I would go crazy.\n\nAfter that, I started doing all of the fitness work after I got out of the military and my dad was like, \u2018Hey I want to get back in shape,\u2019 so I gave him a diet plan and the workout routine, \u2018do this and you can get abs.\u2019\n\n[Back then] he was like, \u2018At 63\u2026I don\u2019t think I can get abs,\u2019 and I said to him, \u2018Do everything I told you and you will.\u2019\n\nI told him, \u2018If you get abs I will get you on the cover of a magazine.\u2019 Six months he got abs, and then six months later I got him on the cover of a magazine.\n\nM&C: You are obviously motivating, on the show however you are dealing with a lot of children. Let\u2019s talk about Elizabeth\u2019s behaviors, on reality TV, producers gin up drama, can you talk about that charity party scene and your relationship with the women at the Abbey?\n\nKC: Right out the gate, when I met Elizabeth it was kind of like, alpha male-meets-alpha lesbian female they\u2019ve really tried to go after the alpha male just to claim that. She and I butted heads really hard, in the beginning, We had three or four fights that were all cut out of the episodes already that lead up to the fight at the charity event. It kind of seems like it came out of nowhere, but we had already gone at it before then because\u2026I don\u2019t know\u2026 we are both trying to be \u2018the man,\u2019 I guess, I don\u2019t know what the correct term is.\n\nAt the event, she was still at me, I didn\u2019t know she had any kind of history with an eating disorder or that stuff, I obviously didn\u2019t know. I was quite a few drinks deep, and if you can\u2019t tell by the slurring of my words in that part [laughs] but I kind of said something that I definitely should not have said and it took her back. She kind of went through a lot of personal issues but I was the one who set it off, so I became the target.\n\nIt was at a charity event and I didn\u2019t care if we were on camera or not, I was like, \u2018leave me alone. I don\u2019t want to talk to you right now, we are at a charity event.\n\nShe wouldn\u2019t stop and it got bigger and bigger. She had a total meltdown. After that, we didn\u2019t speak for a good two weeks, anywhere we went we wouldn\u2019t speak to each other, just stay out of each other\u2019s way. In Palm Springs, we all had ou own room and she tried to come over to mine, and I was like \u2018I don\u2019t want to talk,\u2019 and she insisted she wanted to talk.\n\nI said, \u2018I really want you to stay out of my way because you are going to make me look bad to America, please don\u2019t talk to me on or off camera.\u2019 She insisted, we talked, and I was like, \u2018Alright, thank you, I am not trying to come after you\u2019 and she said she felt like this and we really .. we both apologized and go past it.\n\nThe next day in Palm Springs you see on the episode this guy Chris calls her a \u2018whale,\u2019 he tells Erin \u2018stop talking to the whale.\u2019 I was in the jacuzzi with Marissa and I heard that. That was wrong, that is to a different level. It was directly at her and it was body shaming at its worst. So I hopped out of the jacuzzi and was like \u2018Let\u2019s go,\u2019 to her and she was having a crisis, and when she is upset, \u2018leave me alone.\u201d\n\nShe internally implodes so I got the other guy out of there, and was like, \u2018Listen, I get it it sucks I am sorry.\u2019\n\nShe didn\u2019t want to hear that. What\u2019s funny is that right now, she got on a workout and diet plan and she looks incredible and is in great shape. She is doing it naturally, the right way. Since that day, she and I are friends have a much better relationship.\n\nIt\u2019s weird because in Los Angeles everybody is so fake, everybody lies to you, so to have somebody \u2013 clearly, she\u2019s taking her issues to a personal level- but some wear their heart on their sleeve and they\u2019re honest and upfront and too much.\n\nI prefer that over somebody that hides that and doesn\u2019t tell me how they really feel. She and I are cooler and in a better place than anyone else on the show.\n\nIt\u2019s weird because in Los Angeles everybody is so fake, everybody lies to you, so to have somebody \u2013 clearly, she\u2019s taking her issues to a personal level- but some wear their heart on their sleeve and they\u2019re honest and upfront and too much\u2026I prefer that over somebody that hides that and doesn\u2019t tell me how they really feel. She and I are cooler and in a better place than anyone else on the show.\n\nM&C: Let\u2019s talk about Daniel\u2026he insinuates a lot of rumors about you and Billy\u2026how do you handle him?\n\nKC: Daniel is just a goon. He\u2019s just\u2026I don\u2019t know. How do I say this in the nicest way possible? Daniel is the guy who just gets made fun of but he also makes fun of himself. Most of the way he acts is just for the show, in real life he is not an issue for me at all and never has been.\n\nIn the show he wasn\u2019t pushing me in the pool or doing any of that stuff to me, he\u2019s just doing that to certain people to get some airtime. But he is a goofy guy, he doesn;t take himself that seriously and he doesn\u2019t offend me, and I don\u2019t take him that seriously either, He knows \u2026 he doesn\u2019t even believe the stuff he\u2019s saying \u2018Oh yeah, Kyle and Billy are more than roommates\u2026\u2019 or whatever.\n\nM&C: Is he the classic vintage David Spade of the cast?\n\nKC: The thing is he tries to be the David Spade of the cast but just falls short. Because he\u2019s not original. Even his \u2018Oh, my look is Blue Steel, Ferrari, Le Tigre?\u2019 whatever\u2026 he just stole that from Zoolander! For someone who hasn\u2019t seen Zoolander, they would think he\u2019s a funny guy, but if they had they\u2019d be like, \u2018Oh he ripped off all their material.\u2019\n\nM&C: What\u2019s the story with you and Marissa?\n\nKC: She was the new girl who came in, and was like, \u2018Alright.\u2019 How real do you want it? She came in, super nice girl, super sweet. I\u2019ll pursue this girl and hung out with her a little bit and found out she had an on again-off again boyfriend. So usually when that happens, it\u2019s like, well make this girl make a decision, hold her feet to the fire.\u2019 Let\u2019s see what are her true feelings\u2026so I hung out with Ashley one day and Marissa was like, \u2018I don\u2019t like that.\u2019 I could tell right away.\n\nWe dated for a while and I think you will see as the episodes go on. we go on a couple of dates and she doesn\u2019t give me much attention, doesn\u2019t really care that much. I put effort into it and wasn\u2019t appreciated. I want to find someone who appreciates me.\n\nM&C: What\u2019s your world domination plan and end game, do you want to be an actor or monetize your fitness brand?\n\nKC: Pretty much both. When I moved to LA the goal was acting and fitness. I am continuing to create more fitness items, and I would love to create a men\u2019s skincare line. there\u2019s not really much for guys out there.\n\nAlso, in acting, I have been on four auditions this week, two more and I am trying land some roles to get recognition. Problem is, getting a co-starring role on a show is difficult. I got a role on Shameless last year, but they are few and far between. You cannot overpower anybody on the show and I have a leading man look. There\u2019s not going to be sending me out against leading actors out there because they have credits and all of that. I\u2019m doing this show to raise my footprint to where taking a gamble on me might be worth it down the line.\n\nM&C: What requisite qualities are crucial for you to consider a mate and possibly a family down the road?\n\nKC: If it\u2019s in the cards I would love that. First and foremost is honesty, followed quickly by respect. I have been lied to alot since I\u2019ve been to LA by different women. I avoid it, if I am lied to once I am done. Honesty is a huge thing. I always put my partner before me, so if I am dating a girl, I am all about her and she\u2019s all about her, I\u2019m done. Someone that is as caring and giving as I am.\n\nFamily is big, someone that comes from a good family. I understand when someone a broken home I understand it wasn\u2019t their doing, sometimes it affects them though and things come out that are because of that childhood. it\u2019s tough to deal with that. I like outgoing, athletic girls willing to try things and who are adventurous. They must my love dog or they are done.\n\nM&C: Who wouldn\u2019t love your dog, Koda?\n\nKC: Right? I had a girl walk in an almost, \u2018Ewww,\u2019 like making a \u2018don\u2019t come over to me\u2019 face right at my dog. I thought well, this is not going to work. Koda doesn\u2019t have to love them, but they have to love her. That\u2019s the way it goes! [laughs]\n\nM&C: Signature Abbey drink you make and recipe, please?\n\nKC: The main drink at the Abbey we are known for is a Mixed Wild Berry Martini. It\u2019s two ounces of Absolut Acai, an ounce and half of mixed berry medley liqueur and a splash of sweet and sour, and shaken and a splash of grenadine and two or three blueberries and raspberries on top. When I make it, I try to do more Absolut Acai and less mixed berry medley, because it is so, so sweet.\n\nM&C: Anything else to look forward to the Abbey \u2013 any surprises?\n\nKC: You will see some dates, my whole family which is super awesome for me. The fact I was able to get my dog and my entire family and best friend on national television is a really cool thing. They meet Marissa in Vegas where I was born and raised. We all have dinner together. We have a lot of fun in Vegas and \u2026 we come back and kind of open up the chapel next door to the Abbey and that\u2019s pretty much te end of season one.\n\nM&C: Who is your favorite in the cast?\n\nKC: I have to pick Brandi [Andrews, the host]. She is the coolest chick ever. She is having a baby with Lawrence. She is so cool, she\u2019s there and mama bear for everybody.\n\nWhat Happens at The Abbey airs Sundays at 10/9c on E!"}

Shiloh and Maddox were not seen.\n\nJon, who wore a shirt and jacket, completed the family group.\n\nIt is still rare that the 78-year-old is seen with his grandchildren, following the end of his six-and-a-half year estrangement from Angelina.\n\nThe star still best known for his appearance in the 1969 movie Midnight Cowboy split from wife Marcheline Bertrand when their daughter was only an infant, with the two divorcing by the time Angelina turned four.\n\nFamily dinner: The father and daughter took her children Pax, Zahara, Vivienne, and Knox to a sushi restaurant for dinner\n\nFamily ties: It is still rare that the 78-year-old is seen with his grandchildren, following his six-and-a-half year estrangement from Angelina\n\nJon and Angelina had only sporadic contact during her childhood, yet in her early TV and film work she still used her full name of Angelina Jolie Voight.\n\nBut, perhaps because she did not want to be seen as trading on her father's fame, she had dropped the Voight in favour of her middle name by the time she appeared as Lara Croft, a female version of Indiana Jones.\n\nIt is not known what caused her to fall out with Voight, who played her father Lord Croft in the movie.\n\nTwins: Vivienne and Knox carry bags as they leave the restaurant; the logo is from the fancy Beverly Hills Hotel\n\nStrained relationship: Jon and Angelina had only sporadic contact during her childhood\n\nSingle mother: Pax follows Angelina out of the building\n\nSisters: Zahara and Vivienne are pictured heading back to their car\n\nBy July 2002, however, she was applying to have her non-acting name legally changed to Angelina Jolie, losing the Voight.\n\nThe following month, Voight gave an interview on U.S. television in which he claimed his daughter, who had just adopted a Cambodian boy named Maddox, had 'serious mental problems'.\n\n'I'm broken-hearted... because I've been trying to reach my daughter and get her help, and I have failed and I'm sorry,' he said.\n\n'Really I haven't come forward and addressed the serious mental problems she has spoken about so candidly to the press over the years, but I've tried behind the scenes in every way.'\n\nPatched up: Voight repeatedly tried to regain contact with his daughter, particularly after her mother's death from cancer in 2007; Pax and Zahara are seen at dinner\n\nAngelina responded by cutting off her father completely, saying that, as a new mother, she did not think it was healthy to associate with him.\n\nIn an interview a year later, she said Voight's comments were damaging because they could have affected her relationship with Maddox.\n\n'They could have decided he's right, she's crazy, let's remove that child from her custody, and that's unforgivable.\n\n'My father and I don't speak.

I\u2019m prolly gonna post on der for a little while and take a breather from Twitter and [Instagram] for a little. Just sometimes can\u2019t help but bump into some negative sh*t that really can bum u out and it\u2019s not worth it honestly,\" replied Grande, who also turned off comments on her Instagram account. \"Promised I\u2019d always tell you.

No nothing happened,\" Davidson wrote on his Instagram Story. \"No, there's nothing cryptic about anything. I just don't wanna be on Instagram anymore, or on any social media platform.\"\n\n\"The Internet is an evil place and it doesn't make me feel good,\" he continued. \"Why should I spend any time on negative energy when my real life is f**king lit?

It\u2019s been me and Lauren for four years, so when you add a daughter to the mix, it makes life even crazier,\u201d Thomas Rhett told Matt Lauer and Hoda Kotb, the latter of whom recently adopted a baby girl of her own. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t trade it for the world. It\u2019s crazy how little Willa has adapted. It\u2019s pretty amazing.\u201d\n\nThe singer and his wife recently detailed their journey to adoption exclusively to PEOPLE. Lauren first met Willa, aptly nicknamed \u201cBlessing\u201d in her home country, in 2016 when she visited Uganda \u2014 a country with 147 million orphans. At the time, the couple had been trying to conceive without success and had just begun to discuss adoption.\n\nWhen Thomas Rhett saw a photo of Lauren holding Willa, he was struck by his wife\u2019s obvious bond with the baby, who had been orphaned when she was still a newborn.\n\nThomas Rhett, Willa Gray Atkins, and Lauren Kailey Dickerson\n\nRELATED: How Thomas Rhett and Wife Lauren Spent Daughter Willa\u2019s First Day Home from Uganda: She Had \u201cNever Seen Dogs Before\u201d\n\n\u201cLauren had this amazing glow about her and it just felt like she was already our daughter in a weird way,\u201d Thomas Rhett said. \u201d \u2018I just blurted out, \u2018We should bring her home.\u2019 \u201c\n\n\u201cWhen I met Willa, her story was pretty intense,\u201d Lauren said of the toddler, who\u2019d been brought to the children\u2019s home soon after her birth in November 2015.\n\n\u201cAll orphans have heart-wrenching stories, but it felt like this specific baby was ours. I think that the Lord knew what he was doing when he did not let us get pregnant.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Adoption Holds a Special Place in Katherine Heigl\u2019s Heart\n\nIt was far from a simple process, though. Many months of documents and red tape followed and, in between, the couple made a dozen trips to the African nation over the past year.\n\nIn the meantime, they discovered Lauren was finally pregnant (another girl!), which meant that her window for bringing Willa home was closing fast.\n\nNearing her third trimester, Lauren traveled to Uganda in April, hoping to bring Willa home. But the adoption wasn\u2019t finalized before she needed to return to the States for a pregnancy checkup.\n\nEventually, Lauren\u2019s dad \u2014 an airline pilot himself \u2014 and her mom took their daughter\u2019s place in Uganda, and the two made the 7,000-mile journey to Nashville, Tennessee, with their new granddaughter.\n\n\u201cSeeing her there felt like a dream,\u201d Lauren recalled of her first glimpse of Willa when her parents drove up to the private hangar where they met.\n\nThough the couple has had to adjust to full-time parenting pretty quickly, they\u2019re relishing in their new roles.\n\n\u201cIt is very weird to be called \u2018Dad\u2019 by a little human being,\u201d Thomas Rhett said. \u201cBut it is one of the coolest feelings in the world.

{"label": true, "txt": "0\n\nThis Friday, Netflix will release the sequel series Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later. True to its subtitle, the upcoming series will take place ten years after the events of the 2001 movie and the 2015 prequel series Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp. Almost everyone involved with those projects is returning including (deep breath): A.D. Miles, Amy Poehler, Beth Dover, Chris Meloni, Chris Pine, David Hyde Pierce, David Wain, Elizabeth Banks, Eric Nenninger, H. Jon Benjamin, Janeane Garofalo, Jason Schwartzman, Joe Lo Truglio, John Early, Josh Charles, Ken Marino, Kristen Wiig, Lake Bell, Marguerite Moreau, Marisa Ryan, Michael Ian Black, Michael Showalter, Molly Shannon, Nina Hellman, Paul Rudd, Rich Sommer, Sarah Burns, and Zak Orth.\n\nHowever, one cast member who won\u2019t be back is Bradley Cooper. He had a scheduling conflict, but they still wanted to involve the Ben character, so they recast the role with Adam Scott. The joke in the new series, as this clip explains, is that Ben had plastic surgery, so this is the mini Parks and Recreation reunion you\u2019ve been waiting for (as opposed to A.C.O.D. where Scott\u2019s character calls Poehler\u2019s character the c-word).\n\nCheck out the Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later clip below. All eight episodes premiere on Netflix on Friday. New cast members include Skyler Gisondo, Samm Levine, Mark Feuerstein, Marlo Thomas, Joey Bragg, Jai Courtney, Dax Shepard, and Alyssa Milano.\n\nHere\u2019s the official synopsis for Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later:"}
{"label": true, "txt": "Last season, Dr. Jackie was a mature woman who survived cancer and sought to be a role model for African-American women. Dr. Simone was a doctor who liked to drink, hated exercise and loved her family. Mariah and her Black-adeshi family were at the center of most fights and Quad tried to avoid having sex with her nerdy husband. Oh, and Toya made Kelly Bundy look like a Pulitzer prize winner. Kari was there but she\u2019s undergoing a very personal struggle with her lips and couldn\u2019t be a part of this season.\n\nQuad is back and looking semi-clownish. Her hair is orange, her lips are red and her eyeshadow looks like something out of Face Maker circa 1983. It could be the fact that I\u2019m watching this on a 13 inch TV but all of this color is making my soul hurt. Anyway, she\u2019s shopping at her friend\u2019s store and he brings up the pressure for her to have a child. Okay, is this scene even in English? Quad and Reco sound like the result of James Brown possessing their bodies \u2013 if he was resurrected as a gay Southern man. I think the moral of the story is that Quad doesn\u2019t want to have babies yet but let\u2019s get down to the real story. Reco asked Mariah to pose for his magazine but she said she was busy. He told her he wanted to use Quad but Mariah felt it wasn\u2019t right to use someone else in her circle. Quad cries because her BFF is a selfish moron. I can\u2019t believe she was really crying over this so I choose to believe that there\u2019s more to this story. Maybe Mariah tried to show a family vacation slideshow on Quad\u2019s forehead. I don\u2019t know.\n\nDr. Jackie and Dr. Simone meet and discuss fun facts. For instance, some women forget to remove their IUD for decades and it\u2019s up to these brave souls to remove it. That was just the appetizer for the really fun stuff. Dr. Jackie talks about her husband\u2019s regret over not having a son. The first year of her marriage was when she went through her first bout with cancer. She also had a miscarriage so she wants to discuss using donor eggs with his sperm so he can have a child. Dr. Simone warns her not to do it because she\u2019s busy and she\u2019ll have to give stuff up in order to have a child. The conversation ends abruptly when Dr. Simone has to take off to push the eject button on a patient\u2019s uterus.\n\nMariah ruins her daughter\u2019s self-esteem during a family photo shoot when she tells her that she doesn\u2019t know how to give face and takes her place in the family photo. I see a Lauren Manzo in the making. I don\u2019t know what the Black-adeshi equivalent of provolone and egg salad is but order up a 30 year supply. Stat. Mariah\u2019s family, including her infamous mother, is there for dinner and Mariah asks her nephew Ian about being bullied at school. Mariah\u2019s advice to him is to beat up the girl who\u2019s been hitting him. More specifically, \u201chit it and quit it!\u201d First of all, the girl probably likes him and secondly, has Mariah not heard of school shootings and suicide? Kids are over the top these days. The last thing they need is permission to act out on whatever impulse they have. Third, \u201chit it and quit it\u201d definitely refers to sex. Perhaps she wants him to continue the reality tradition and be a star on MTV\u2019s Teen Dad: Reality Offspring. Then again this is Mariah. She\u2019d probably love for the kid to have a full meltdown so he can\u2019t overshadow her own kids.\n\nMariah says that she and Quad don\u2019t speak anymore and her sister says that Mariah created Quad. Actually, Suzuki invented quads. Mariah says that Rico Chapple, the dress shop man, got in Quad\u2019s ear about Mariah being jealous of her. Mariah\u2019s mother must\u2019ve read her hate mail last season because she\u2019s dressed like she\u2019s going to an inauguration and she\u2019s got a Hilary Clinton weave. Mariah\u2019s mom is disappointed in Quad so you know what that means. Quad\u2019s getting a beat down with a purse.\n\nDr. Simone gets home late from work. She missed her kid\u2019s game because a patient was in labor. Her husband, Cecil, was able to cover parental duties. She feels like she\u2019s trying to juggle lots of balls and based on her husband\u2019s facial expression, there\u2019s definitely a couple of blue balls in the house. Dr. Simone switched to a new billing system and she was prepared for a 3 month pay delay but not the 6 month one that she\u2019s going through. I love a doctor who can admit she\u2019s broke right now and can call herself a bitch in a loving way. I should have gone to medical school. I\u2019m always calling myself names and avoiding calls from collections.\n\nQuad is making breakfast for her husband, Greg. He\u2019s surprised and she makes the point that she can do this now that she doesn\u2019t work. She\u2019s brilliant! Quit work, do one menial task and justify leeching for as long as possible. Momma Joyce from RHOA would be relieved to know that Kandi\u2019s not the only \u2018victim\u2019. I love that she greets her husband politely but says good morning to her dogs like they got a medical degree and give her an eyeshadow allowance. Plus, her husband speaks in a higher pitch than her dogs bark and he doesn\u2019t need to be walked. He might need to be neutered though. She would give him sexy time but he farts in his sleep. I don\u2019t know why we need to hear about this but it makes me understand my perpetual loneliness. Dr. Gregory brings up the baby subject and fails to get her in the mood by basically saying that she\u2019s old. He tells her that she\u2019s on the back-end of thirty and she needs to get started. She laughs it off, says she\u2019s just starting her thirties and secretly pours laxative into his pancake batter.\n\nToya is a stay at home mom. Bravo basically spends 12 seconds catching up on her life of barely taking care of her kids and then has her go over to her dentist and friend\u2019s house. Dr. Heavenly says that Toya isn\u2019t the sharpest knife in the drawer but she likes her spirit\u2026and role on a TV show. Dr. Heavenly is having a soiree for Atlanta\u2019s medial elite and hopes that everyone is on their best behavior. She questions the behavior of Drs. Jackie and Simone at Toya\u2019s sickle cell event. Dr. Jackie offended a plus-sized pageant winner and Dr. Simone was dancing on Toya\u2019s husband. It sounds to me like the two of them went to reality TV school over the hiatus.\n\nDr. Simone borrows a purse from Dr. Jackie for the party and says she\u2019s putting nothing in it. Andy Cohen, please cut this lady a check.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the computer? I need to put this purse on ebay.\u201d\n\nAt the party, Dr. Simone hugs Dr. Heavenly\u2019s husband and asks if it\u2019s okay to touch him. Obviously, she\u2019s gotten word regarding the talk that\u2019s circulating about her actions at Toya\u2019s party. They both squat and get into a pissing contest for wives. Dr. Heavenly brags that she works part-time so she can cook for her husband and be submissive. Dr. Simone mocks her for only being half a doctor and calling her husband \u201cdaddy\u201d. Dr. Heavenly even brags that she ironed her husband\u2019s tuxedo. Umm, what?! Did she do that before or after she took it out of the dryer?\n\n\n\n\u201cAfter I took it out and since we\u2019ve been standing here I gave myself an orgasm so he doesn\u2019t have to do it later.\u201d\n\nSimone\u2019s husband tries to stop the conflict and Simone tells her not to start sh*t with her. Dr. Heavenly says if Simone starts it, she\u2019ll finish it. Heavenly\u2019s husband immediately yanks her leash and reprimands her for using the s-word. They each go to their separate corners. Kari and her lips make an appearance at the event. Quad and Mariah fake kiss and greet each other. Dr. Jackie and Simone are hanging out when Dr. Heavenly comes over for part two of her argument.\n\n\n\nDr. Jackie: There\u2019s nothing angelic about those fat rolls, Dr. Heavenly.\n\nSimone apologizes for Heavenly getting in trouble with her hubby but Dr. Heavenly doesn\u2019t mind being submissive to her husband and says that the two of them know nothing about that. Then, Dr. Heavenly calls Jackie out for criticizing the pageant girl in the bowling alley. She keeps emphasizing that the girl was insulted in a bowling alley and no one wants to be insulted in a bowling alley. I\u2019ll do you one better. No one wants to be in a bowling alley. Why in the hell were Atlanta\u2019s medical elite and random plus-sized beauty queens throwing greasy balls down a lane for charity? Dealing with greasy balls for a wedding ring or green card is one thing but I wouldn\u2019t do that for messed up cells.\n\nJackie takes the women aside to talk about the issue and Mariah makes her way into the conversation. In flashbacks, we see Dr. Jackie lecture Miss Plus-Size Georgia on heart disease, portion control, activity and bob sweat. Dr. Heavenly says that she lost 70 pounds so she knows where the pageant girl was coming from and she didn\u2019t want to hear that stuff in a bowling alley. Dr. Jackie talks about the importance of health and says that Heavenly doesn\u2019t totally get it because she isn\u2019t really a doctor. Dr. Heavenly explains that she is a doctor and Jackie corrects it by saying that she doesn\u2019t deal with hearts just crusty teeth. Meanwhile, Mariah is in the background setting Black-adeshis back 2 years with exclamations of \u2018Yes Jesus, hunty, oh Lord!\u2019. They\u2019ve only been around for like 8 years so it\u2019s like a quarter of their history down the drain. Jackie ultimately apologizes for hurting or offending anyone but she says that obesity cam lead to cancer which she\u2019s had.\n\n\n\nDr. Jackie: I am really, truly sorry. I can\u2019t express how sorry I am\u2026that I went to a bowling alley.\n\nDr. Simone jumps into the argument to help defend Jackie and Heavenly threatens to kick her out of the house. Dr. Simone doesn\u2019t mind, in fact she doesn\u2019t feel welcome so she\u2019s ready to leave.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already shoved two bottles of Absolut into my bag.\u201d\n\nAfter that conversation is over, Toya confronts Simone about grinding on her husband at the event. Simone doesn\u2019t recall doing it and then says that Toya couldn\u2019t even see around Eugene so how could she know.\n\n\n\nToya: I had on glasses. They call me five eyes.\n\nDr. Simone is on a roll and I don\u2019t mean those attached to Miss Plus Sized Georgia. She\u2019s angered Dr. Heavenly, made fun of Toya\u2019s dizzy eyes and called Eugene fat. I love her. Dr. Simone storms out and we\u2019re ready to roll for the rest of the season.\n\n\n\nDr. Heavenly: Can I have ice cream tonight, daddy?\n\nHusband: Right after you watch My 600 LB Life and write a 500 word essay on not ever gaining back 70 pounds.\n\nThis season, Jackie and Quad entertain reproduction, Simone has marital issues, Toya gets hit in the head again and no one likes Mariah. What\u2019d you think? It was a decent premiere and I hope it gets even better. The new doctor should be on next week\u2019s episode and why didn\u2019t we get to see the bowling alley, sickle cell fundraiser? It looks like that would\u2019ve been a good season premiere!\n\nWant more TrashTalk?

{"label": true, "txt": "It's been five years since Kerry Washington first donned Olivia Pope's white trench coat on the ABC drama \"Scandal.\"\n\n\"In the first season it was as if Olivia Pope was race-less,\" Washington told Glamour in its May issue. \"There was no denying that Olivia was a black woman, because I\u2019m a black woman, playing her in bad--- white trench coats that call to attention the fact that I\u2019m not looking like anybody else on television. But we didn\u2019t talk about her identity as a black person.\"\n\nThat changed after the first season.\n\n\"[Since then] the writers have become more and more willing to deal with race,\" Washington continued. \"When Olivia was kidnapped, it was not lost on me that the fictional president of the United States was willing to go to war to save one black woman at a time when hundreds of black women were missing in Nigeria and we were begging the world to pay attention. Shonda [Rhimes, the show's creator] was saying, 'The life of a black woman matters.'\"\n\n\"Scandal\" is now in its sixth season. As for how much longer Washington will play Pope, she said it's up to Rhimes.\n\n\"Shonda has said from the beginning that she kind of knows how it ends. So I\u2019m trusting her to guide the arc,\" the 40-year-old actress said. \"It's also important for me to do other work -- and playing Olivia gave me the opportunity to become a producer. The charge of my production company, Simpson Street, is to tell stories that are about people, places and situations that may not always be considered by the mainstream. Inclusivity is not about, you know, creating a world where straight white men have no voice; it\u2019s about creating a world where we all have a voice. So I\u2019m excited to start that new journey, as a producer.\"\n\nWashington already uses her voice to speak on behalf of civil rights, LGBTQ individuals and women's issues.\n\n\"That idea of holding each other\u2019s hands at the Women\u2019s March -- it feels like we are being invited to do that every day,\" she said in Los Angeles at the Women's March in January. \"So many of us are feeling attacked, whether it\u2019s a woman\u2019s right to choose or headstones in a Jewish cemetery, immigrants being deported or banned. So many of us feel the need to protect and defend our democracy. And march toward the dream of being 'We the people.' So that\u2019s exciting, scary, and frustrating. We\u2019re awake. We are awake more than ever before, and we have to stay awake.\"\n\nThe mother of 2-year-old daughter Isabelle and infant son Caleb, with husband Nnamdi Asomugha, is partly motivated by making the world better for them.\n\n\"My deepest desire is to create a world where there\u2019s room for all of us, where no matter who you are, you get to wake up in the morning and know that you are worthwhile and deserving,\" Washington said. \"If that\u2019s the world I want to live in, I have to do the work to make that true for me. I have to do the work of self-love and affirmation, and say, 'I am a woman, I am a person of color, I am the granddaughter of immigrants, I am also the descendant of slaves, I am a mother, I am an entrepreneur, I am an artist, and I\u2019m joyful.' And maybe in seeing my joy, you can finish your sentence with, 'And I am joyful too.'\""}
{"label": true, "txt": "Image caption Spears (right) has signed up as a judge on the US version of X Factor\n\nBritney Spears was the all-American pop princess who shot to superstardom in her teens before a very public breakdown. Now, her appointment as a judge on the US X Factor represents a full return to the media spotlight.\n\nThe most stark illustration of how far Britney Spears had fallen came on 16 February 2007 when, after she spent just 24 hours in a rehabilitation clinic, the paparazzi tracked her down to a Los Angeles tattoo parlour - and discovered she was completely bald.\n\nThe act of shaving her head was a clear rejection of her former persona and of her life as a pop starlet in the public gaze.\n\nHer meltdown came after eight years as the archetypal modern pop starlet - \"Miss American Dream since I was 17,\" as she put it in her 2007 single Piece of Me.\n\nImage caption Spears achieved overnight success with her debut single in 1998\n\nShe found sudden fame as the blonde girl with pigtails and a school uniform in the video of her debut single ...Baby One More Time, a massive global hit.\n\nHer first taste of the spotlight had come as one of the young cast of Disney's TV show All New Mickey Mouse Club alongside Christina Aguilera and Justin Timberlake in 1994.\n\nAfter her solo breakthrough, she became a fixture in the charts and in the gossip columns, but carefully cultivated a squeaky-clean image.\n\nShe had a three-year relationship with fellow Mouseketeer and pop star Justin Timberlake, but they split in 2002, with Timberlake's single Cry Me A River apparently an angry kiss-off to his former partner.\n\nSpears focused on her career, ditching her songwriting team to work with stars such as R Kelly and Moby on her fourth album In The Zone in 2003.\n\nShe also courted the tabloids at the 2003 MTV Awards, where she locked lips with Madonna during a risque performance of Like A Virgin.\n\nImage caption Madonna and Britney also collaborated on the single Me Against The Music\n\nBut perhaps more controversial was her union with childhood friend Jason Alexander, who she wed in a Las Vegas wedding chapel in January 2004.\n\nThe marriage was annulled after 55 hours, with Spears later explaining: \"I really wanted to see what it was like to be married.\"\n\nIn July the same year she got engaged to her backing dancer Kevin Federline, just three months after meeting him.\n\nImage caption Spears and Federline were married for just over two years\n\nThe couple tied the knot in September 2004 and the couple had two children.\n\nBut they divorced in 2006 and many fans, who had barely concealed their contempt for Federline, thought the split would mark a re-birth for Spears - whose recording career had been on hold since the marriage.\n\nIt was not to be.\n\nSpears' behaviour became more erratic and she embarked on a prolonged period of partying with other young celebrities, including heiress Paris Hilton.\n\nShortly before her divorce, Spears gave a rambling television interview, in which she tearfully proclaimed her marriage \"awesome\" and blamed the media for making her an \"emotional wreck\".\n\nThe shaved head shocked her fans and Spears went back into rehab, this time staying for a month.\n\nImage caption Spears shaved her own head with a set of clippers while onlookers watched through the window of a Los Angeles tattoo parlour\n\nWhen she attempted a live comeback, performing at the MTV Video Music Awards in 2007, she stumbled through a lip-synced performance and was universally panned.\n\nAs Green Day singer Billie Joe Armstrong put it at the time, it was like \"watching a public execution\".\n\nHer personal life was in chaos. After a 10-month custody battle, Federline won sole custody of the couple's children Sean Preston and Jayden James.\n\nImage caption The star has been criticised for lip-syncing at her concerts\n\nSpears' parenting skills were called into question when a judge in Los Angeles ordered her to undergo drug and alcohol tests twice a week.\n\nA former bodyguard claimed the singer was a danger to her children. She was charged with hit-and-run after an incident in an LA car park, and was dropped by her management company.\n\nHer parents blamed manager Sam Lutfi, whom they accused of controlling their daughter's life by drugging her and taking control of her finances. He has denied the claims.\n\nDespite the MTV incident, she continued to win musical plaudits. Her fifth album Blackout, largely created by a crack team of pop producers, was sonically adventurous and a hit with fans.\n\nThe turning point in her personal life is regarded as coming the following year, when her father Jamie took control over decisions regarding her personal life, including food, clothing and medical care and finances.\n\nRestraining orders were obtained against Lutfi and Spears' ex-boyfriend Adnan Ghalib and her former manager Larry Rudolph was reinstated.\n\nImage caption In 2011, MTV presented Spears with the Video Vanguard award, its equivalent of a lifetime achievement prize\n\nHer next album, Circus, included the track Womanizer, which became her first US number one single since ...Baby One More Time and an accompanying world tour earned $131m (\u00a382m).\n\nDespite a private and public rehabilitation, at the end of 2010, her lawyers failed to overturn the ruling that gave her father full control over her affairs.\n\nBut this April, her fiance and former agent Jason Trawick became her joint guardian - with her father's blessing.\n\nNow 30, the X Factor deal should provide an opportunity for the star to show that she has put her troubled past behind her."}

{"label": true, "txt": "British acting royalty Matt Smith and Lily James have become quite the hot couple of the acting scene ever since going public with their relationship back in 2015, but how did Lily James and Matt Smith meet, exactly? Well, despite making their first public appearance as an official couple at the Cinderella premiere in Milan three years ago, the love between the Doctor Who and Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again stars actually began to blossom a year prior.\n\nThe pair were first introduced back in 2014 whilst working on the set of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, as Grazia reports, and speculation of a romantic relationship between Smith and James first emerged after the Mirror reported they were spotted together at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. Shortly after the festival, rumours which hinted at a budding relationship between the actors only intensified after being photographed together once again, this time in London, as the Daily Mail reported.\n\nThese outings were the first time Smith and James had been romantically linked to anyone after the break up of their previous relationships with actress and model Daisy Lowe and actor Jack Fox, respectively, however it appears both have clearly moved on as they enjoy their third year together \u2014 which in celebrity terms, could be considered a lifetime.\n\nKevin Winter/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nSince they began dating the couple have enjoyed continued success in the world of acting, seen recently in Smith's Emmy Award nominated portrayal of Prince Philip in The Crown, and James' role in the Oscar-winning Darkest Hour. However, it's the recent juicy engagement rumours surrounding the two that have really got fans talking.\n\nAfter displaying a huge diamond ring, as Metro reported, which just so happened to be placed on her engagement finger at the 2018 BAFTA Awards, speculation of potential nuptials was sent into overdrive. And boyfriend Smith added more fuel to the rumour-mill fire whilst speaking on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs when he revealed he was open to the idea of having children, and soon. The 35-year-old said \"I am thinking about kids quite a lot. I\u2019d like a lot of them.\"\n\nKevin Winter/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nHowever, those rooting for a fairytale wedding in the near future were left disappointed after James briefly addressed the engagement rumours in an interview with Porter Edit. When discussing the supposed \"engagement\" ring she showed off on the BAFTAs red carpet, Lily said \"I\u2019m just not very superstitious about rings. It\u2019s stupid, probably, but I just put rings on any finger... I mean, Jesus. That ring\u2019s worth one million pounds\u2026\"\n\nAlthough I wouldn't dust off your wedding hats just yet, the current lack of any plans to tie the knot isn't to say there won't be wedding bells in the future. In a recent interview with Marie Claire, James expressed the possibility of herself and Smith buying a home together when she said, \"We want to get somewhere\", and continued \"That's going like, 'Can we go furniture shopping?' We bought a rug...and I love getting flowers and making things look nice.\"\n\nSo, even though marriage might not be on the cards just yet, the prospect of an engagement between this couple sounds like it could be well on the way. Though for now it sounds like they're having lots of fun together. In James' interview with Porter, she also explained how she nearly missed Glastonbury for her Mamma Mia audition, with the clash causing a \"real argument\" between the couple. At least it all worked out for the best."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Phillip Faraone / WireImage\n\nSelena Gomez is used to living a crazy life. Since debuting at Wizards of Waverly Place in 2007, she has been one of the most famous people in the world. In fact, she was forced to experience all her ups and downs with millions of viewers. This year was no exception. In the last twelve months alone, she has undergone a major operation, released new music and films, gone through a breakup \u2013 and looked closely at the media. As Selena celebrates her 26th birthday today, we take some time to reflect on the highlights of her past year, with a timeline of her greatest moments. Through all this she has become stronger than ever. And yes, her fans never loved her again.\n\nJuly 2017: During her month of birth, Selena released her latest single called \"Fetish\". Next to the song was a sexy video that focused on her lips. The official music video, directed by Petra Collins, was released later this month. The song reached # 27 climax on the Billboard Hot 100. On her 25th birthday, Selena had a solemn celebration with some of her closest friends and shared the event with her Instagram. Although the then friend The Weeknd was in Paris on their special day on tour, he allegedly flew in to celebrate with her. August 2017: August was a weak month for Selena. She was not often seen in public except for a delightful Disneyland date with her husband. The couple seemed to be very loved and was not afraid to show PDA in the amusement park.\n\nSeptember 2017: September comes with a great revelation: Selena reveals that she underwent a kidney transplant this summer because of her lupus. In a viral Instagram post, Selena wrote: \"I'm really looking forward to sharing with you, soon my journey through these last months, as I always wanted to do with you.\" She also thanked her kidney donor Francia Raisa, writing, \"She gave me the ultimate gift and sacrifice by donating her kidney to me, and I'm incredibly blessed.\" After a few months Selena jumped back into work and filmed the Woody Allen movie A Rainy Day in New York alongside Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet. The film later became controversial due to allegations of sexual misconduct against Allen. He denies her. In response, Selena later stated that she would donate her salary for the Time's Up initiative. In addition, Selena was a cover star for Time Magazine and celebrated her first-person achievement reaching 100 million followers on Instagram.October 2017: October drew attention to Selena's private life as she went through a public disconnect and make-up. At the end of October, it was reported that Justin Bieber was discovered when she brought Los Angeles home. Although we did not jump to conclusions about the nature of their rekindled relationship, speculation grew as Selena announced her breakup with The Weeknd. Soon after, Justin and Selena began spending more time together. In addition to her love life, her single was released with Marshmello \"Wolves\" and climbed into the charts. In addition, the fans were happy when she met at the InStyle Awards with her old friend Demi Lovato.\n\nVasquez-Max Lopes / BACKGRID\n\nNovember 2017: Jelena started November with a bang. The couple was discovered on a bike ride through Los Angeles and did little to deny love rumors. The couple began spending more time together, confirming speculation with a kiss on Justin's hockey game. In addition to her new romance, Selena wore a new look and colored her famous dark curls Platinum Blonde for her performance at the AMA Awards. December 2017: End the year right! Selena became Billboard's Wife of the Year and gave an informative interview where she talked about her mental health struggles, her kidney transplant and her relationships. Selena crowned 2017 in Cabo San Lucas with friends, with Justin joining her to the New Year. January 2018: Selena started with a breather in 2018. She traveled to her home state of Texas and visited her parents' home. She thought about what might have been written, \"I visit this place on every occasion I get, in many ways it could have been better today than it does today, but I'm grateful for a voice that can make change today possible I do not know how to do it or really want it, I love you, Grand Prairie, thank you. \"In her month of reflection, she embarked on a two-week program of anxiety and depression. February 2018: A month of public love for Selena and Justin! The couple seemed to get strong as they traveled together, made out at a concert and attended his father's wedding in Jamaica.\n\nMarch 2018: On the first day of the month, Selena released her first Instagram of Justin in over five years. She rang the bell on her 24th birthday with a photo of her and a Polaroid script, \"March 1, 1994, someone I know who happens to be super cool, was born.\" Boom. \" Just a few days after her posting, it was reported that the couple was taking a break from their romance. Selena traveled to Australia for a Hillsong Conference Solo. In addition, her separation from \"The Weeknd\" with the release of his new album, which many speculated about, was recapitulated through Selena. April 2018: April was a month of activism for Selena. She shared her support for the March For Our Lives movement by posting on Instagram and attending a rally. She also attended her 6th WE Day in Los Angeles and made a speech to raise awareness of kidney disease.\n\nMarion Curtis / StarPix / REX / Shutterstock\n\nMay 2018: Selena was in the limelight again in her most public month! She began the month participating in the MET Gala, where she later laughed at criticism of her appearance. Selena had professional prizes when the second season of 13 Reasons Why, the show she produced, was released on Netflix. Her song \"Back To You\" on the soundtrack of the show became a breakout hit. The singer surprised fans on the reputation tour with his close friend Taylor Swift. The friends performed \"Hands To Myself\" in front of 60,000 spectators in Los Angeles. June 2018: Selena collaborated again with Petra Collins to release the music video for \"Back To You\". The video showed a one-and-two pair, which led the fans to believe that it was possibly based on their relationship with Justin. The most rewarding part of her month came when Selena enchanted the promo for the Orange County Children's Hospital for pictures with fans.\n\nJuly 2018: Selena celebrates July 4th holiday with David Henrie, co-star of Wizards of Waverly Place, who posted stunning photos on Instagram and wrote: \"Hope, everyone had a great 4th of July! Played with some of my favorite people . \" Release of Hotel Transylvania 3 was a great success as it exceeded the box office. Perhaps the most shocking thing this month was Justin's engagement with Hailey Baldwin. However, Selena did not seem to be affected by the news as she was happily spotted spending time with friends and making a new movie in New York State. It's not yet clear how the star will ring in her 26th birthday, but after this crazy year she definitely deserves a party.\n\nDo not miss E!

The sitcom star is even panning the Fergalicious performance.\n\nFollowing the flood of tweets dragging Fergie through the mud, the funny lady, who is known for her brash comedy, hopped on the trashing bandwagon.\n\nThe 65-year-old, who is coming back to TV with a revival of her beloved sitcom Roseanne, wrote, \"Who saw Fergie's national anthem performance at the NBA All Star Game? I think mine was better lowkey.\"\n\nJust in case you need a refresher on Roseanne's performance so you know how much of a diss that really was, here's what we got: On July 26, 1990, the sitcom star took to Jack Murphy field, shrieked, grabbed her crotch and purposefully made a mockery of the beloved song, known for opening up sports games. It's universally known as the worst performance of the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" that has ever been done since Francis Scott Key put pen to paper in 1814.\n\nAfterward, the entire country was outraged, including President George H.W. Bush, who called it \"disgraceful.\"\n\nSo Roseanne saying her performance was better is pretty brutal."}

I do her color, her cut and her styling.\"\n\n\"We have talked about it [the wedding] and we have a plan,\" he continued. \"I can't say any more, but we know what we're doing.\"\n\nMeghan and Harry also chose the music for their wedding service this week, and it will include a full orchestra. St. George's Chapel's Director of Music, James Vivian, will direct the music, which features a selection of choral groups, soloists and musicians, Kensington Palace revealed on Tuesday.\n\nWEDDING COUNTDOWN\n\nSo, how many days until the royal wedding? Meghan and Harry will officially be saying \"I do\" in:\n\nGetty Images\n\nOUT AND ABOUT\n\nThe lovebirds took a brief break from wedding planning early Wednesday morning to represent the royal family at the Anzac Day Service in London, England.\n\nAnzac Day is a day of remembrance for soldiers from Australia and New Zealand who've served and died in wars, conflicts and peacekeeping operations. Both countries are a part of the Commonwealth, of which Queen Elizabeth II serves as leader.\n\nGetty Images\n\nROYAL RUMOR ROUNDUP\n\nAs we anxiously wait to see what Meghan's wedding dresses will look like, there's also talks about what tiara she will be gifted with. There's a good chance that the bride-to-be will debut a brand-new tiara as she walks down the aisle, royal jewelry expert Ella Kay of the blog The Court Jeweler told Good Housekeeping earlier this week.\n\n\"The younger son's wife getting a new tiara would be the precedent,\" she explained. \"Prince Charles might buy her a tiara.\"\n\nPrevious royal brides like Sarah, Duchess of York, and Sophie, Countess of Wessex, received major bling on their wedding day. But, the circumstances are different for Kate Middleton, who wore the Cartier Halo tiara for her wedding, since she will eventually become queen, and will \"borrow\" tiaras in the meantime.\n\n\"Usually what happens is you get allotted your tiaras,\" Kay explained. \"Like Camilla [Duchess of Cornwall] has three, but they're all technically loaners that not anyone else wears.\"\n\nRATHER REGAL LOOKS\n\nGetty Images\n\nMeghan outdid herself with not one, but two regal looks in one day.\n\nWhile stepping out to the Anzac Day service, the 36-year-old brunette beauty donned an elegant gray Smythe coat with a black dress underneath, Sarah Flint Jay heels, a Gucci Dionysus bag, a red poppy pin and a statement wide-brimmed, floppy hat. This type of hat is much simpler than the fancy fascinators and pillbox hats we typically see on royals like Queen Elizabeth II and the Duchess of Cambridge, but we love that Meghan put her own unique spin on the trend.\n\nFor her second look of the day, Meghan opted for a more formal ensemble. The bride-to-be arrived to Westminster Abbey in a black beret embellished with a dragonfly from milliner Philip Treacy, which she pulled off perfectly by pairing it with a midi-length Emilia Wickstead dress suit and a Jimmy Choo box clutch.\n\nSERVIN' UP SUITS\n\nUSA Network\n\nSadly, this section of our weekly royals countdown ends this week, as Meghan appeared in her very last episode of Suits on Wednesday.\n\nIn case you missed it, we recapped the full finale (HERE).\n\nYou had a good run, Rachel Zane.\n\nSPARKLE LIKE MARKLE\n\nEarlier this week, ET caught up with one of Meghan's former makeup artists, Spencer Barnes, who opened up about her evolving beauty looks and how when he was still doing her makeup, Meghan always requested a natural look.\n\n\"She loves beautiful skin, to start with, and she has the most gorgeous complexion,\" Barnes mused. \"It's that soft, caramel. Her mixed heritage makes her an exotic beauty of beauties. Her chocolate eyes, the way her eyes light up when she smiles, I love her smile, her teeth and her lips. And then her perfect brows.\"\n\n\"Whenever I'd work with her, she'd like to highlight her fresh, radiant skin,\" he continued. \"We'd do a very glowing, fresh-faced skin. We'd use earthy tones, colors that enhanced her natural beauty, rather than a lot of obvious color choices, like purple, green or blue. We'd stick with earthy tones -- peaches, golds, browns -- a lot of rich, warm tones and that really flattered her. It helped her just look radiant and fresh.\"\n\nSee more in the video and in our exclusive article (HERE).\n\nLOL OF THE WEEK\n\nPrince George and Princess Charlotte arrive at St Mary\u2019s to meet their little brother. pic.twitter.com/rfX9rsdJhU \u2014 Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) April 23, 2018\n\nSpectators couldn't get enough of Princess Charlotte this week.

{"label": true, "txt": "Where there\u2019s a Danielle, there\u2019s drama.\n\nThat\u2019s at least true on The Real Housewives of New Jersey. While OG Housewife Danielle Staub is just a \u201cfriend\u201d of the cast this season, Melissa Gorga promises she\u2019s at the heart of much of what goes down in the episodes to come.\n\n\u201cI think Danielle is always good for the wow factor,\u201d Melissa tells ET. \u201cWhen Danielle comes in, she's very passionate \u2026 so, it brings a really good flavor of like that passion, like crazy\u2026 I can't explain it, but she brings something to the table.\u201d\n\nDanielle only makes brief appearances in the season nine trailer, most of them in flashes of dramatic moments that have little context. One of those moments is Melissa flipping out while the ladies are in Mexico on their all-cast trip. The 39-year-old screams at, seemingly, Danielle, \u201cYou got the wrong f**king girl!\u201d\n\n\u201cI think everyone knows me by now, to have Melissa Gorga, like, wig out and go crazy, you really have to push my buttons to the limit,\u201d she teases. \u201cSo, when we're away in Cabo, I have a moment. I watch it back and I'm like, 'Ooh! I look like a tough girl. Oh, my God!\u2019 I'm really not mean like this, but somebody must have pushed my buttons! Let's put it that way.\u201d\n\nMelissa says that as far as she knows, Danielle won\u2019t get confessional interviews this season like the rest of the cast to explain her side of everything. That means viewers will only experience all the Danielle drama through the lens of her co-stars, and most of the cast isn\u2019t on great terms with the 56-year-old. Today, Melissa says it\u2019s really only her sister-in-law, Teresa Giudice, who keeps up with Danielle.\n\nRodrigo Varela / Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s an unexpected turn for the group, seeing as Melissa, Teresa and Margaret Josephs all served in Danielle\u2019s May wedding to former baseball player Marty Caffrey. The couple split just months later, a move that Melissa admits did not shock her.\n\n\u201cThere was tension at the wedding,\u201d she reveals. \u201cYou are gonna see it, and you're gonna see us saying something is off here. You know, like, why are we doing this? Yeah, I think I could see. Listen, I'm no pro, but I've been in the game for 14 years of marriage. You know 14 years going strong. So, it's like, I could see when something is not gonna be a match.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not all Danielle drama this year, though. Melissa is also swept up in family tension, playing monkey in the middle with her husband, Joe, and sister-in-law, Teresa, over the Gorgas not spending enough time with Teresa and Joe\u2019s ailing father, according to Teresa. Still, Melissa says things will never get as bad as they were in her early RHONJ days, when her and Teresa\u2019s husbands got into a brawl at Melissa\u2019s son\u2019s christening.\n\n\u201cWe're in a good place,\u201d Melissa shares. \u201cWe're not in a bad place, we're just not going to agree on everything. It's not real to agree on everything for her and I.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think if we were friends, it'd be worse because we wouldn't have mutual children that love each other with the same bloodline,\u201d she adds. \u201cSo I'd be like, 'B*tch!' It would be different.\u201d\n\nMelissa is currently standing by her sister-in-law as she and her family await a final ruling on her husband Joe Giudice\u2019s deportation to Italy. The family submitted an appeal earlier this month.\n\n\u201cI think the next step right now is just to wait it out and pray,\u201d Melissa says. \u201cThat's basically what everybody is doing. They're just kinda hoping that it's gonna turn around. It is very sad because, you know, he has four daughters and they love him. Like, they truly -- which all little girls love their daddy -- they want him here. So we are all just praying that it turns around.\u201d\n\nThe Real Housewives of New Jersey airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\n'RHONJ' Star Melissa Gorga Admits She Now Understands Why Couples Get Divorced (Exclusive)\n\nWhy Teresa Giudice's 'RHONJ' Castmate Doesn't Think She'll Ever Divorce Joe\n\n\u2018RHONJ\u2019: Dolores Catania Ready to \u2018Flip Out\u2019 on \u2018Wackadoo\u2019 Danielle Staub (Exclusive)"}

{"label": true, "txt": "Ask any woman who has had multiple kids and she'll tell you that every pregnancy is different. No one carries their baby the same exact way each time, or experiences the same cravings, or aches and pains as before. For Chrissy Teigen, her second pregnancy is \"harder\" than her first for a reason that so many moms of multiple young kids probably will know all too well.\n\nNo, this pregnancy hasn't made Teigen feel more sick or brought on some new weird cravings than when she carried her first child, 2-year-old daughter, Luna. Instead, Teigen recently revealed to E! News that what makes this pregnancy much harder than her first is that she didn't have an adorable and energetic toddler who needed constant attention during her first pregnancy.\n\n\"You realize your second pregnancy is harder because you have a kid already,\" Teigen said during an interview with E! News. Teigen's husband, John Legend, added in the same interview, \"You have to divide your energy between raising a kid and carrying one as well.\"\n\nGiven how adorable and full of personality little Luna seems to be from Teigen's Instagram account, it's probably a bit challenging for Teigen to keep up with her when her energy is already drained from being pregnant.\n\nTeigen isn't alone in thinking the second pregnancy is much harder than the first for this reason. There are so many reasons why moms believe this to be true \u2014 a lot of women feel more tired because they have another human to take care of, in addition to caring for the one growing in their stomach, according to Today's Parent.\n\nAnd Legend is right \u2014 pregnancy does require a lot of energy from moms, and not just because they're doting on another kid. Pregnant women might experience a lack of energy from hormonal and physical changes that occur, according to the American Pregnancy Association, in addition to the amount of planning that goes into preparing for another child. This can (understandably) leave some women drained. Add a toddler into the mix and you've got a whole new reason to feel exhausted.\n\nBut there are a lot of things different about this second pregnancy for Teigen than her first. For starters, she is expecting a boy, which she announced in January, two months after announcing her pregnancy last November. But since this is her second child, she already has a few items in her house to help with the baby's arrival (unlike her first pregnancy when she had to start from scratch). In an interview with Entertainment Tonight on Tuesday, Teigen joked that her son will be on the receiving end of Luna's hand-me-downs. \"We're kind of just using Luna's old things,\" Teigen said. \"It will be fine.\"\n\nAnother thing that is harder about this pregnancy? In the time that has elapsed since her first pregnancy, Teigen has become an even bigger social media star. Because of this, she has so many more people following her pregnancy, criticizing her decisions, and pestering her about her due date, according to Yahoo!, which has taken its toll on Teigen. According to Yahoo!, Teigen asked her Twitter followers this past week to \"mind their own uteruses\" when talking about her decisions as a pregnant woman and told Instagram commenters that she wanted to \"hide and get this baby ready for the world.\" Can you blame her?\n\nBut once her pregnancy is over, there will be a whole new set of challenges that Teigen will have to deal with \u2014 like having two young children in the house. Teigen told E! News last month that she is fearful Luna won't be the best at sharing her things with her baby brother. The good news is, Teigen doesn't have to worry just yet \u2014 her baby isn't due until June, according to E! News, giving her plenty of time to give Luna all of her attention (and exhaust herself a bit more) until her baby boy's arrival.\n\nCheck out Romper's new video series, Bearing The Motherload, where disagreeing parents from different sides of an issue sit down with a mediator and talk about how to support (and not judge) each other\u2019s parenting perspectives.

It was written by David Benioff & D.B. Weiss and directed by Alan Taylor.\n\nContents show]\n\nPlot\n\nJon and the Brotherhood hunt the dead. Arya confronts Sansa. Tyrion thinks about the future.\n\nSummary\n\nAt Winterfell\n\nAt Winterfell, Arya Stark talks to her sister Sansa Stark about borrowing Bran Stark's bow and arrow. She tells Sansa that she practiced several times until she finally hit the bullseye. Arya recalls that their father Eddard Stark had been watching and clapped his hands in praise of her accomplishments. Arya reasons that their father knew that the rules were wrong but that his daughter was in the right. She then confronts Sansa about her alleged role in their father's death.\n\nArya presents the letter that Sansa had written to their late brother Robb Stark urging him to come and bend the knee to King Joffrey Baratheon. Sansa replies that the Queen Mother Cersei Lannister forced her to do it under duress. Arya counters that she was not tortured and that she saw Sansa at Ned's execution; Sansa retorts that Arya did nothing to stop their father's execution either. Arya chastises Sansa for betraying their family but Sansa responds that they have only returned to Winterfell because of her, while Arya travelled the world in pursuit of her own agenda. Sansa adds that their half-brother Jon Snow was saved from defeat when Petyr Baelish and the Knights of the Vale came to their rescue and insists Arya would not have survived the torments she endured at the hands of Joffrey and Ramsay.\n\nSansa demands to know where Arya found the letter and chides her younger sister that Cersei would be pleased to see them fighting but Arya is still bitter towards Sansa. She realizes that while Jon would understand the difficult circumstances Sansa was under when she wrote the letter, Sansa is afraid the Northern lords will discover it and turn on her, including Lyanna Mormont. Arya adds that Lyanna is younger than Sansa was when she wrote this letter but argues Lyanna wouldn't agree with Sansa's defense that she was a child at the time. While recognizing that Sansa wrote the letter out of fear, a bitter Arya says that she prefers to embrace anger over fear.\n\nLater, Sansa asks Petyr Baelish about where Arya got the letter from, unaware that Baelish orchestrated the entire incident. Sansa tells Petyr that she is commanding 20,000 men who answer to Jon but not to her. Petyr tells Sansa that the men will trust her because she can rule. Sansa does not trust the loyalty of the Northern lords, citing their history of switching sides. She counters that the discovery of the letter will turn her liege lords and men against her. Sansa confides in Petyr about her strained relations with Arya. Petyr suggests that Sansa talk to Brienne of Tarth because she has sworn to protect both of Lady Catelyn Stark's daughters from harm's way. Trusting Baelish, Sansa accepts his advice.\n\nThe following morning, Maester Wolkan informs Sansa that they have received a letter from Queen Cersei. Sansa meets with Brienne, who advises her not to leave Winterfell. Instead, Sansa decides to send Brienne as her representative since she could reason with Jaime Lannister. Brienne warns that it is too dangerous for her to leave Sansa alone at Winterfell with Petyr. Sansa insists that her guards and men are loyal to her but Brienne warns that Petyr might be bribing them behind her back. Brienne offers to leave her squire Podrick Payne, whose swordsmanship has improved, but Sansa insists that she can take care of herself.\n\nFollowing the events of the Wight Hunt, Sansa enters Arya's quarters and opens a leather case containing several \"faces\", including the literally late Walder Frey's face. Arya catches her sister pilfering through her personal effects. When Sansa tells Arya that her men are loyal to her, Arya mockingly retorts that they are not here. Arya tells Sansa that she obtained the faces from the Faceless Men of Braavos and admits she spent time training to be a Faceless Man. She forces Sansa to play the lying game and begins by asking if she thinks that Jon is the rightful King. Sansa demands that Arya tell her what the \"faces\" are.\n\nArya replies that they always wanted to pretend to be other people. Sansa wanted to be a queen while Arya herself wanted to be a knight. In the end, neither of them got what they wanted. Arya says that the faces allow her to become someone else and toys with the idea of assuming Sansa's face and status. Arya approaches Sansa with her dagger and muses as the possibility of becoming the Lady of Winterfell. However, Arya relents and leaves a disturbed Sansa alone with the dagger.\n\nThe Wight Hunt\n\nAt Dragonstone castle, Queen Daenerys Targaryen and her Hand Tyrion Lannister chat in the Chamber of the Painted Table. Daenerys tells Tyrion that she appreciates the fact that he is not a hero because they have a tendency of risking their lives to do dangerous things. She compares Tyrion favorably to \"heroes\" such as Khal Drogo, Ser Jorah Mormont, Daario Naharis and Jon Snow, most of whom \"do stupid things, trying to outdo the others\". Tyrion, slightly amused, notes that all of those individuals fell in love with Daenerys, but she dismisses the obvious implication that Jon Snow is in love with her \u2013 to which Tyrion sarcastically quips that Jon must be staring so longingly at her because he is so eager for a military alliance. Daenerys remarks that Jon is too little for her tastes, but immediately apologizes when she realizes she's accidentally insulted Tyrion's height. Daenerys also recognizes that Tyrion is no coward. The two then turn their attention to the topic of their impending meeting with Queen Cersei in King's Landing. Tyrion admits that Cersei cannot be trusted and could be setting a trap for them, but that Daenerys will have the Unsullied, the Dothraki and her dragons at hand; if anyone tries to harm her, King's Landing will be leveled in response.\n\nDaenerys wonders whether, given that Cersei will almost certainly be attempting to double-cross them, they should be planning something similar. Tyrion is firmly against any deceit, counseling Daenerys that while she needs a healthy degree of fear to instill respect, she cannot rule through fear alone, as leaders who rule through fear alone like Cersei, Tywin, and Joffrey are hated by their people and forever vulnerable to being overthrown. Tyrion reminds Daenerys about her vision of creating a new society by \"breaking the wheel\" rather than merely imitating prior rulers like Aegon Targaryen, and cautions her about her temper and impulsiveness, citing the fiery executions of Lord Randyll Tarly and his son Dickon. Daenerys asserts that such an action was necessary, but Tyrion still believes she should have attempted more merciful means of dealing with the problem the Tarlys posed, or at least left them alive long enough to consider her other options rather than having them summarily executed. As Daenerys becomes increasingly agitated in the face of Tyrion's blunt but reasonable remarks, he reassures Daenerys that he supports her vision and ideals. Tyrion also proposes that Daenerys consider a succession plan in the event of a disaster, given that by her own admission, she believes she is incapable of bearing children. She refuses to consider this plan until she has donned the crown, also coldly blaming Tyrion's policy of caution for causing her the loss of Highgarden, Ellaria Sand, and Yara Greyjoy.\n\nJon Snow and his ranging party travel through the lands beyond the wall on their mission to capture a wight. Gendry complains about the bitter cold and asks Tormund about life as a Wildling. Tormund later confides with Jon about the foolhardy nature of their mission, while Jon discusses his difficult negotiations with Daenerys. Tormund points out that the pride of the Northmen may cost them too many lives, citing Mance Rayder and the Wildlings as an example. While walking, Gendry also confronts the Brotherhood Without Banners about selling him off as a sacrifice to Melisandre. Sandor Clegane sneers that Gendry should be grateful that he is still alive and points out that Beric Dondarrion has been killed six times (including once by Sandor himself) \"and you don't hear him bitching about it\". Not entirely sure what to think of that particular revelation, Gendry accepts a drink from Thoros's wineskin.\n\nWhile walking, Jon and Jorah Mormont also chat about their relationships with their fathers Eddard Stark and Jeor Mormont respectively. They say that their fathers were good and honorable men and did not deserve their deaths. Jon tells Jorah about the brutal death of Jeor at the hands of the Mutineers and that Eddard was beheaded. Jon tries to return to Jorah his father's Valyrian sword Longclaw but Jorah tells him that he is not worthy to bear his father's sword, having forfeited any claim to it when he brought shame into his House. His father gave the sword to Jon, and gives his blessing for Jon and his future children to keep it.\n\nLater, Sandor and Tormund trade jabs about sex. Sandor takes offense when Tormund asks about how he burnt his face. Tormund then confides in Sandor about his infatuation for Brienne of Tarth, who is nearly as tall as Sandor. He jokes about having \"monstrous\" babies with her, to Sandor's utter bewilderment. Beric and Jon talk about Eddard Stark and how they have both been resurrected by worshipers of the Lord of Light. Beric tells Jon that he is fighting for life because death is the first and last enemy; it is inevitable, but it is human nature to fight it for as long as you can. He warns Jon that they have to work together to fight death and defend those who cannot defend themselves. Jon reflects on his Night's Watch oath about being the \"shield that guards the realms of men\" and agrees. Sandor sees the mountain from his vision lying ahead and steers the group in that direction.\n\nWhile trudging through a snowstorm, Jon and his party sight a massive snow bear with blue eyes approaching them. The snow bear turns out to have been resurrected by a White Walker. The monstrous creature mauls and kills three of their company. Beric and Thoros manage to set the snow bear alight with his flaming sword but it continues to attack, forcing Thoros to get in its' way when it attacks Sandor. Thoros is unable to break free of its jaws until Jorah stabs it with a dragonglass dagger. Beric cauterizes Thoros' wounds with his flaming sword.\n\nJorah asks the wounded Thoros about his experience charging with a flaming sword during the Siege of Pyke, and commends his old comrade for his drunken bravery. While navigating through the mountain, they see a column of Wights marching through the canyon below. The ranging party plants a fire and then ambushes the wights and the White Walker leading the pack. Jon manages to kill the White Walker with Longclaw, causing most of the Wights associated with it to disintegrate, while the rest of the group manages to capture the only unaffected wight. The creature unexpectedly screeches for help; Sandor slaps his gloved hand over its mouth, but it wrenches its face away when its mouth skin tears off into the glove, to Sandor and Jorah's disgust. As Jorah pulls out a bag from his jacket and secures it over its head, Sandor and Tormund bind the creature. In the middle of this, they realize they can hear a massive host of wights heading their way, hastening their work.\n\nAs the noise of the horde approaches, Jon sends Gendry back to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea to bring news to Daenerys as he's the fastest. Gendry gives his war hammer to Tormund, who hands it to Sandor who has the wight slung over his shoulder. The wights pursue the group over a lake of weak ice, as they flee toward a large stone island jutting out in the middle. One of the party trips and falls behind; a few of the horde tackles him, the combined weight breaks the ice, and they fall through. This causes a chain reaction of breaking ice all around the rock until the horde slows to a stop to avoid the water. Throughout the night, Jon and his comrades wait in the middle of the ice while encircled by the army of the undead. Meanwhile, Gendry reaches Eastwatch's outer gates but collapses from exhaustion. Davos Seaworth and several guards attend to him. When Davos asks what happened, Gendry tells him to prepare a raven; Davos orders to bring the Maester.\n\nIn the morning, Jon and his company awake to find that Thoros has died from his wounds. Beric and Sandor pay their last respects, with the former praying for the Lord of Light to guard them. At Jon's insistence, they burn the body with Beric's flaming sword so Thoros can't be reanimated. The wights watch while their captive Wight struggles under its hood and restraints. Jorah proposes killing the wight but Jon counters that they need to keep it as evidence. Beric suggests that Jon kill the Night King, who has just arrived on horseback; given that they've seen killing a Walker destroyed the wights it controlled, killing the Night King might destroy them all. He then adds that the Lord of Light has not resurrected Jon for no reason, but Sandor reminds him that they have just lost their priest, and Beric is now down to his last life.\n\nAfter receiving Gendry's message from Eastwatch, Tyrion implores Queen Daenerys, who has donned a cold-weather version of her Targaryen garb, not to leave for the North because it is too risky. Daenerys counters that he told her to do nothing before and she lost. Dissatisfied with his advice, Dany leaves with all three dragons to the lands beyond the Wall to aid Jon Snow and his ranging party.\n\nBored, Sandor hurls two rocks at one of the undead minions, knocking its jaw off. The second however, skids across the ice, and both the party and the undead quickly realize the ice, which has hardened overnight, is strong enough to support their weight, and in ever-increasing numbers, the horde attacks the group's position. Sandor holds them back with Gendry's hammer while Jon and the other members of the ranging party join in, wielding weapons of fire, dragonglass or Valyrian steel. Beric manages to set several of the wights alight with his flaming sword. The ranging party hack and slash at the wights with their blades but are unable to stem the tide. With the group overwhelmed, Jon orders them to fall back to the highest part of the island. Tormund is overwhelmed by several wights and is nearly dragged under the ice, but is saved by Sandor, who drags him back onto the island. The group continues fighting against the wights. One of the Wildlings falls off a ledge and is ripped apart by the creatures, who begin to scramble up the ledge towards the living.\n\nWhen all seems lost, Queen Daenerys arrives with her dragons, who attack the wights with dragonfire. Hundreds of wights are burned to ashes while others collapse under the ice, which is melted by dragonfire. Jon and his party rush to Daenerys and her dragon Drogon, dragging their captive wight with them, while Viserion and Rhaegal provide covering fire from above. Meanwhile, the Night King obtains an icy javelin from one of his lieutenants and hurls it at Viserion, scoring a direct hit. Viserion is struck in the neck and plunges helplessly into freefall, shrieking in agony as blood and fire pour from the fatal wound. Drogon and Rhaegal cry out for their brother, but are powerless to help him as Daenerys watches in horror and sorrow. Viserion crashes onto the frozen lake, shattering the ice, and slowly sinks beneath it.\n\nAs the Night King readies another spear, Jon hollers at Daenerys and company to leave with her remaining dragons before being dragged under the ice by two wights. Daenerys and the survivors of Jon's ranging expedition flee with Drogon and Rhaegal before the Night King can kill them. He hurls the second javelin, but Drogon narrowly dodges it. With the dragons gone, the Night King and his army leave the scene. Later, Jon Snow climbs out of the ice and regains Longclaw. Jon is quickly spotted and pursued by a large horde. Before the wights can finish the King in the North, his long-lost uncle Benjen Stark appears on horseback with his flaming flail. Benjen tells Jon to flee on his horse while he stays behind to buy time for Jon to escape. While riding away on horseback, Jon watches his uncle being overwhelmed by the undead.\n\nAt Eastwatch, Sandor carries the struggling Wight into a boat. Tormund and Beric tell him they will meet again but Sandor retorts he hopes not. Daenerys sends Drogon and Rhaegal to scour the surrounding mountains for Jon. Jorah tells Daenerys that it is time to leave but she insists on waiting a bit longer. Before she can leave, they hear a horn blowing signalling a rider approaching. Looking down from the battlements, Dany sees a wounded Jon Snow approaching on horseback. Aboard their ship, Davos and Gendry tend to Jon Snow, who has suffered severe hypothermia and several minor injuries. Daenerys also notes the massive scars on his chest from his previous fatal wounds.\n\nIn the Narrow Sea, Jon Snow wakes to find Daenerys watching over him in his chambers. Jon apologizes for the disastrous ranging party and the fact it caused Viserion's death, but Daenerys tells him not to apologize because she now knows that the Army of the Dead is real. Overcome with emotion, she tells Jon that the dragons are the only children she will ever have, and vows that she and Jon will together destroy the Night King. Jon thanks her for her support, addressing her as \"Dany\", and Daenerys realizes that the last person to address her by that name was her older brother Viserys Targaryen, who Daenerys remembers as not being a good person. Jon apologizes and asks if \"My Queen\" would be more appropriate; realizing he is agreeing to bend the knee, Daenerys asks Jon what the Northern lords loyal to him will make of this. Jon assures her they will come to see her for the good person she is, as he already has. Touched by his statement, Daenerys gently takes Jon's hand in her own for a moment. They gaze into each other's eye for a moment \u2013 a long moment \u2013 but Daenerys suddenly pulls away and tells him to get some rest and leaves him alone.\n\nLater, hundreds of Wights use several large chains to drag Viserion's corpse out of the frozen lake as the Night King and one of his lieutenants watch. When the dragon's corpse is dragged far enough out of the lake, the Night King walks over and places his hand upon Viserion's snout. All is quiet for a moment... and then Viserion's eyes snap open, shining a depthless, icy blue.\n\nProduction\n\nCast\n\nCast notes\n\nAppearances\n\nFirst\n\nDeaths\n\nNotes\n\nGeneral\n\nDragons traveling to the Wall\n\nIt is totally impossible that a raven could be sent to Dragonstone, and then Daenerys could ride her dragons back to the Wall, in the only one or two days , at most, that Jon's group was trapped by the White Walkers. The distance from the Wall to Dragonstone is half a continent \u2013 Cersei even stated in dialogue that Westeros is \"a continent\" two episodes ago in \"The Spoils of War\". The Title sequence of the TV series itself even visually depicts a map indicating the vast distance between Dragonstone and the Wall. There is no possible in-universe explanation for this. Given that the showrunners have admitted that the Wight Hunt doesn't even happen in future novels, it appears that they wanted to have Daenerys swoop in to save Jon instead of, without a raven, Daenerys changing her mind and deciding to head North to help Jon, in which case she could have spent over a week flying to the Wall catching up with them. Instead, the episode clearly establishes that Gendry had a raven sent from the Wall to Dragonstone, and then Daenerys flew her dragons to the Wall after receiving the letter, in enough time to save Jon's party while they were trapped on the island in the frozen lake. Ignoring, for the sake of argument, that the top flight distance and speed of dragons has never entirely been confirmed, the speed of the messenger-raven network across Westeros has been established. Even giving the over-generous assumption that Jon's group survived at most two days on the island in the ice lake (and it seems more like one, until the ice refroze), and using the assumption that dragons can fly from Dragonstone to the Wall in a single day, this would be claiming that a messenger-raven sent from the Wall could reach Dragonstone in at most a single day. Prior seasons have repeatedly shown that the messenger-raven network isn't nearly the fast, with messages taking days or sometimes weeks to cross large distances \u2013 particularly, the distance of half a continent from the Wall to Dragonstone (Dragonstone is roughly about as far from Eastwatch-by-the-Sea as King's Landing was from Castle Black in prior seasons). Even this is assuming that it wasn't one raven in a direct flight, but fresh ravens spreading the message to new castles in a chain (i.e. like a human messenger switching to a fresh horse at each new castle he passed so he could ride for two days in a row, instead of staying on the same horse and tiring him to death).\n\nIt is totally impossible that a raven could be sent to Dragonstone, and then Daenerys could ride her dragons back to the Wall, in the only , at most, that Jon's group was trapped by the White Walkers.

Earlier in Season 7, writer and staff loremaster Bryan Cogman was repeatedly questioned by fans over Twitter that certain characters are moving around too fast in Season 7, rushing to get them where they need to be for plot points without thought to realism. Cogman countered that these were still plausible movements, given that they avoided saying how much time passes between episodes (i.e. for all we know, it took Grey Worm months to reach Casterly Rock from Dragonstone, and ships travel faster than land armies). The week before this episode aired, however, he quit Twitter and closed his account, so he can't field any new questions about this even greater case of time compression. [2]\n\nDirector Alan Taylor responded in an interview with The New York Times , \"I've only looked at one review online, and it was very much concerned with the speed of the ravens. I thought, that's funny \u2014 you don't seem troubled by the lizard as big as a 747, but you\u2019re really concerned about the speed of a raven. It is true there are time issues, and I'm not exactly sure how many kilometers there are between Eastwatch and Dragonstone. But it was a bit dreary to hear somebody who said, \"I cannot enjoy this episode because, you know, that speed of that raven...'\" He suggested that more time may have passed on the island than was implied, \"since it's always sort of an eternal twilight north of the Wall.\" [3] Taylor went on to insist, \"They seemed to be very concerned about how fast a raven can fly but there\u2019s a thing called plausible impossibilities, which is what you try to achieve, rather than impossible plausibilities. So I think we were straining plausibility a little bit, but I hope the story\u2019s momentum carries over some of that stuff.\" He insists that a raven flying from the Wall to Dragonstone in this short of an amount of time, while unlikely, is still within the realm of physical possibility. As for waving aside \"a lizard as big as a 747\" as an example that the storyline is fantastic to begin with, they already established in their fictional world how fast dragons are - and then broke their own rules. This is sometimes called the \"Magic A is Magic A\" principle, that even in Science Fiction & Fantasy worlds in which \"magic\" and magical creatures exist, once a set of rules have been established for them, those rules have to be followed consistently. Otherwise, it undermines the integrity of the story: by the same principle, for example, Highgarden could have sent a raven to Dragonstone when it came under attack earlier in the season, and Daenerys could have flown her dragons to defend it rather than let her Tyrell allies be slaughtered (and Highgarden is a shorter distance from Dragonstone than the Wall).\n\n, \"I've only looked at one review online, and it was very much concerned with the speed of the ravens.

Martin of The World of Ice and Fire sourcebook, commented on this after the episode. She calculated (based on flights from Dragonstone to King's Landing) that it would take a dragon about 28 hours flying continuously at top speed to travel from the King's Landing/Dragonstone region to the Wall - which she regarded as implausible, because a dragon can't fly continuously for that long. This is comparable to saying a horse could plausibly reach a destination if it ran at a full racing-speed gallop for 28 hours straight: mathematically it could, but it can't physically maintain that speed for even remotely that long. [4] She went on to say, however, that the raven network is so much slower than this (as confirmed by better citations), that there is no plausible way one could carry a message from the Wall to Dragonstone in enough time for Daenerys and her dragons to react to it, then fly to save Jon. She concluded, \"This would be the Game of Thrones episode where they broke the plot so badly that suspension of disbelief is well and truly dead.\" [5]\n\nsourcebook, commented on this after the episode.

A world doesn\u2019t make sense \u2014 and isn\u2019t compelling \u2014 if it has no clear limits, because then there are no stakes. Whether there are ten fans or millions of fans, a fantasy story can\u2019t debunk its own rules and hope that nobody notices.\" [6] Karthryn VanArendonk of Vulture/NYMag said: \"Does it matter that the Game of Thrones timeline makes absolutely no sense? We\u2019re long past the point of arguing that time within the world of the show actually works, but if you are a person who cares about this sort of thing \u2014 if a disregard for how fast fictional bodies could reasonably move around a fictional map was ever going to disrupt your ability to enjoy dragon battles \u2014 then Sunday\u2019s episode is the one that finally tipped you over the edge.\" [7] Lili Loofbourow of The Week said: \"'Beyond the Wall' was \u2014 for many \u2014 a bridge too far. The idea that Daenerys could show up just in the nick of time given the circumstances makes absolutely no sense (here's an in-depth breakdown). Nor was that the biggest stretch of the episode...The explanation for these holes is that there is no explanation; the people making this show literally just don't care about those details anymore...imagine not caring enough to nail down a remotely plausible timeline because you can't be bothered. You'll just hope the spectacle is big enough to make everyone forget the gaps in the plot - it worked so well for the Waif's final fight with Arya, after all!...The chains of causation that made the Red Wedding devastating but understandable are gone.\" [8] Sarah Weymes of WinterIsComing.net reacted to Alan Taylor's lack of a coherent response to the travel time issues: \"The fact that Alan Taylor asked us to suspend our disbelief in reference to the unfeasible timeline because 'there are dragons' is a little insulting. As far as I\u2019m aware, the presence of dragons should have no bearing on Gendry\u2019s ability to sprint a great distance like he\u2019s got a rocket shoved up his bottom. Genre should not act as a stand-in for common sense. A lot of the episode didn\u2019t make sense. The least the showrunners can do is own it.\" [9] Kyle Neubeck of Collider said: \"The setup that brought us here is extraordinarily, impressively stupid.\" [10] Kevin Yeoman of Screencrant said: \"[Does having the Night King get a zombie-dragon] really outweigh Gendry's miraculous spring back to the Wall, or the raven's seemingly faster-than-light travel to Dragonstone requesting Dany's help? All season long Game of Thrones has been playing fast and loose with the rules of geography and time, and for the most part it could be shrugged off so long as you believed the appropriate amount of time had passed. Here, though, the immediacy of the situation takes that option off the table, and the storytelling is weakened as a result.\" [11] Adam Chitwood of Collider said: \"I think 'plausible impossibilities' would be a bit easier to swallow if the show hadn\u2019t so firmly established how time passes in Game of Thrones. Jon Snow spent an entire season traveling to and roaming around the area North of the Wall, but in \"Eastwatch\" Tyrion and Davos travel to and from King\u2019s Landing in the span of an entire episode. It\u2019s not that we can\u2019t buy this 'fast travel' bit of storytelling, it's that it feels like cutting corners in contrast to all that came before.\" [12] Paste magazine made several articles in reaction. Jim Forel said: \"The show is now hurtling along at such a ridiculous pace that the writers simply can\u2019t keep up and craft simultaneous developments of multiple plotlines that make no sense under the most basic of scrutiny...What we\u2019re criticizing here is poor screenwriting, in the sense that they keep writing characters into situations where the story requires they do things the audience understands are either stupid or impossible.\" [13] Shane Ryan said: \"The ridiculous way that characters have seemingly teleported across Westeros this season, appearing thousands of miles away in the blink of an eye, without explanation [is] lazy writing made manifest.\" [14] Matt Brennan decried the entire \"Wight Hunt\" invented by the TV writers, and that Daenerys's speedy arrival is only one of several issues with it: \"The problem runs deeper...The episode - stunningly misconceived, bafflingly constructed, shallow, frustrating, long - is its culmination and, one can hope, its nadir. In truth, the plot's temporal and geographical illogic is unsurprising: Game of Thrones has become impatient with the details that sustain one's interest between the stretches of bloodletting\". [15]\n\n\n\nOn Dragonstone\n\nThe TV series has only briefly \u2013 and not explicitly \u2013 established that Daenerys Targaryen believes she cannot have children again, which was a plot point in the books. In book/Season 1, Mirri Maz Duur performed a blood magic curse which caused Daenerys's baby Rhaego to be stillborn and monstrously deformed. The book version made it more clear that Mirri believed this had done so much damage to Daenerys's womb that she could never have children again; in subsequent books, Daenerys repeatedly reflected in her internal monologue that she considers her three dragons her \"children\" in part because she feels they are the only children she will ever have. In the series, Daenerys mentions her infertility only in \"The Prince of Winterfell\", when stressing to Jorah that she must retrieve her dragons, and in \"The Red Woman\", when Khal Moro says he will lie with her that night and \"if the Great Stallion is kind, you will give me a son.\" Daenerys replies: \"I will bear no children, for you, or anyone else. Not until the sun rises in the west, and sets in the east.\" Both of these references can be interpreted to mean a choice not to have more children, (if one ignores the non-verbal cues incorporated into Clarke's performance), but this episode makes it explicit that Daenerys has told others she believes she is infertile. The final chapter of the fifth and most current novel hints that Daenerys only believes she can no longer have children, but will recover. In her last chapter, she has been stranded by Drogon back in the Dothraki Sea (corresponding to the Season 5 finale \"Mother's Mercy\"), she notes in her inner POV monologue that she has started \"passing blood\" \u2013 apparently just thinking she is sick, but there are fan theories that it could actually mean that she has begun Flowering again and her reproductive organs have recovered. It is possible, but totally unconfirmed, that magically resurrected people like Jon Snow or Beric Dondarrion cannot have children \u2013 meaning that the bloodline of Daenerys's brother Rhaegar would go extinct as well. In which case, the last blood relative of either of them is actually Gendry \u2013 House Baratheon intermarried with the Targaryens, so (in the books) Robert Baratheon's grandmother was a younger Targaryen princess, and thus Robert was actually the second cousin of both Rhaegar and Daenerys. Tyrion even specifically brings up that if Daenerys think she can't have children, she will need to plan for the future of the crown after her eventual death. He brings up that the Night's Watch and the ironborn have their own methods for selecting new rulers without inheritance (elections, a Choosing and a Kingsmoot, respectively). Both are essentially the same, though: they are democratic elections where the citizens vote for their leader (albeit an absolute one), and the majority wins. In the backstory, when there has been no clear successor, a \"Great Council\" is called by all the major lords of the realm to choose the lawful successor. The last major one picked Aegon V Targaryen, as his eldest brother was dead but left behind a mentally handicapped daughter, his second brother was insane and left an infant son behind who many feared inherited his insanity, and his third brother, Aemon, was a maester who had foresworn inheritance. A prior Great Council at the end of the reign of Jaehaerys I Targaryen tried to sort out the succession dispute between the heirs of his first two sons, who had both predeceased him, before settling on Viserys I Targaryen. Prior Great Councils, however, relied on picking between rival heirs, not a situation in which there was no clear lawful blood heir. It is also possible that, once she learns who he is, she might just name Gendry as her heir \u2013 reconciling with Robert Baratheon's former supporters. A hint at this might be how the real-life War of the Roses ended, which George R.R. Martin said the War of the Five Kings is loosely inspired by. This was a civil war in Medieval England between the Yorks and Lancasters - i.e. Starks and Lannisters, though the roles are reversed in the fictional story: the Lancasters are considered the \u201cgood\u201d faction and the Yorks the \"bad\"/cunning faction. The War of the Roses began with the Lancasters being usurpsed by the Yorks (as the Lannisters usurp the Starks & Baratheons), only for the Yorks to ultimately be defeated \u2013 Henry Tudor, a bastard descendant of the Lancasters, eventually rallied the kingdom against Yorkist king Richard III and defeated him. Similarly, the Baratheons were seemingly wiped out, but left bastard descendant Gendry behind \u2013 perhaps to one day reclaim the throne.\n\nAs in the preceding episode, Daenerys and Tyrion heavily reference her intention to \"break the wheel\" of one tyrant replacing another on the Iron Throne, be it Targaryen, Baratheon, or Lannister. This is an invention of the TV series, possibly to present Daenerys as more of an overt hero and/or to appeal to modern audiences who typically view the desirable evolution of any society being toward some form of democracy, and doesn't happen in the novels. In the books, Daenerys sees the Iron Throne as her stolen birthright and wants to reclaim it for House Targaryen and be a good , benevolent monarch, but by the measure of their existing value system, not by radically re-inventing the system.\n\n, benevolent monarch, but by the measure of their existing value system, not by radically re-inventing the system. Tyrion Lannister recalls that, while not a particularly capable or brave physical warrior, he did lead a charge out the Mud Gate \u2013 which was during the Battle of the Blackwater.\n\nWinterfell\n\nIt is unclear why Arya Stark is behaving the way she does in her scenes with her sister Sansa Stark: she refuses to listen to any of her valid counter-arguments that she wrote the letter to Robb under duress. Arya then outright threatens to kill Sansa and take her face: after launching into a long and uncharacteristically dark threat against Sansa, Arya then simply hands her the Valyrian steel dagger she had been brandishing. If she's worried that Sansa will turn on Jon, threatening her will only exacerbate the problem. Fan speculation is rampant that this is all some elaborate ruse by one or both of the Stark sisters to trick Littlefinger, given that they know he has spies everywhere. Such speculation, however, occurred all too frequently in past seasons to try to explain what turned out to simply be plot holes, inconsistent writing, or simply misinterpretation by fans: i.e. all of the fan theories that Talisa Maegyr's behavior with Robb Stark seemed odd because she was really a Lannister spy. The TV writers later admitted that they rewrote the Robb Stark/Talisa relationship into a romance (which it isn't in the books) primarily for the out-of-universe reason that they wanted to show off Richard Madden (Robb) as an actor. Therefore it is equally possible that Arya is making unusually dark speeches threatening to kill Sansa in this episode, purely because the TV writers wanted to show off Maisie Williams, the actor, chewing the scenery in a dark speech scene.\n\nIt might not have been clear why Sansa sent Brienne of Tarth away from Winterfell, right after Littlefinger said she would try to prevent any strife between the Stark sisters. It's possible that Littlefinger wasn't urging that Brienne would prevent Arya from harming Sansa, but that Brienne would protect Arya from Sansa . Thus Sansa sent Brienne away (and burned the letter so no one will know about it) because this is the first step in moving against Arya, before Arya can turn the Northern lords against her. Another possibility is that Sansa was sincere in saying that it was unsafe for Brienne to be in Winterfell with Littlefinger, distrusting Littlefinger when he brought up Brienne and sending her away so that she doesn't serve as another one of his pawns. However, there is a good chance that this was the result Littlefinger hoped for, as it means that the Stark sisters are even more isolated than before. This is consistent with Petyr Baelish's personality. He manuevers people into doing what he wants by relying on lies and half-truths that are combined with vague wording. That allows Petyr to find loopholes if a scheme fails. He claims that the other person misinterpeted his words and phrases. This plan could easily have blown up in his face, however, if Arya had simply and sensibly told her sister what she had seen: that Baelish had asked the Maester to dig up the note. Sansa would surely see his scheming at once. And there is no way Baelish could know Arya well enough to predict she would not simply do that.\n\nfrom harming Sansa, but that Brienne would protect Arya . Thus Sansa sent Brienne away (and burned the letter so no one will know about it) because this is the first step in moving against Arya, before Arya can turn the Northern lords against her. Another possibility is that Sansa was sincere in saying that it was unsafe for Brienne to be in Winterfell with Littlefinger, distrusting Littlefinger when he brought up Brienne and sending her away so that she doesn't serve as another one of his pawns. However, there is a good chance that this was the result Littlefinger hoped for, as it means that the Stark sisters are even more isolated than before. Sansa says she fears the Northern lords would think her suspect for marrying into enemy Houses \"twice\" \u2013 even though her marriage to Tyrion Lannister in Season 3 was blatantly made under duress while she was literally a prisoner and hostage of the Lannisters in King's Landing. Meanwhile, her marriage to Ramsay Bolton was allegedly part of some bizarre scheme to \"undermine the Boltons from within\" \u2013 even though \"Marriage\" doesn't work like that in Westeros, the Lannisters certainly weren't worried about her \"undermining them from within\" when they forced her to marry Tyrion, and even Sansa \u2013 when she later confronted Littlefinger in Season 6's \"The Door\" \u2013 berated Littlefinger that his plot to marry her to Ramsay didn't really make sense (this doesn't happen in the novels, as the character who marries Ramsey is explicitly stated to be impersonating a Stark to give the Boltons legitimacy). Arya seemingly waves aside Sansa's accurate defense that she wrote the letter to Robb under duress, writing what Cersei told her to write, when she was a frightened 13 year old child told that this was the only way to save her father's life. In Season 1 (\"The Pointy End\"), Robb and Maester Luwin weren't even angry that Sansa wrote the letter, realizing simply from its contents that while it was in her handwriting she was obviously writing down Cersei's words, and was writing under duress as the Lannisters' prisoner. Many of the Northern lords would probably follow this logic as well. Sansa's concern seems to stem from how quickly the Northern lords rallied to and then abandoned Jon. It seems that she is afraid that tf the letter is made public, then at least some of the lords could accuse Sansa of being House Lannister puppet \u2013 not entirely a stretch given how disgruntled some of them are getting, and problematic even if Sansa isn't making a power grab for herself. Sansa's response to Petyr Baelish's analysis of the situation was that she considered his views without becoming emotional.\n\nin Westeros, the Lannisters certainly weren't worried about her \"undermining them from within\" when they forced her to marry Tyrion, and even Sansa \u2013 when she later confronted Littlefinger in Season 6's \"The Door\" \u2013 berated Littlefinger that his plot to marry her to Ramsay didn't really make sense (this doesn't happen in the novels, as the character who marries Ramsey is explicitly stated to be impersonating a Stark to give the Boltons legitimacy). It is somewhat strange that Arya does not mention how Sansa behaved when she and Joffrey encountered Arya and Mycah (\"The Kingsroad\"): all Sansa cared about was \"her beloved Joffrey\", as if he was the innocent victim rather than the bully, and did not care at all that he maliciously injured an innocent harmless kid, without provocation, and then nearly killed her sister; moreover, afterwards she lied brazenly about the incident. Arya has a good reason to resent Sansa for her awful behavior, and to bring it up among her other accusations against Sansa.\n\nIn the first novel, Sansa performed an act that perhaps could be considered as a betrayal against her house - of her own free will, without any coercion: her father told her he intended to send her and Arya back to Winterfell; Sansa could not bear the thought of being sent away from \"her beloved Joffrey\", so she told that to Cersei. In the second novel, Cersei claimed that Ned's plan was foiled thanks to Sansa's warning. Actually, that act had little to do with Ned's downfall, since he revealed to Cersei that he learned the truth about her children, and then put his trust in Littlefinger; that double stupidity resulted in Ned's imprisonment and subsequent death. Arya had no idea about Sansa's aforementioned act (which was omitted from the show anyway).\n\nArya reveals to Sansa for the first time that she was actually watching their father's execution, in Season 1's \"Baelor\", as she was hiding in the crowd in front of the Great Sept. It seems bizarre that Arya accuses Sansa of being there willingly given that Sansa broke into screaming when Joffrey declared he would kill Ned, and then outright fainted when he was beheaded. However, Arya \u2013 who wasn't even a teenager yet \u2013 didn't actually see Sansa faint: Yoren was holding her tight and she had already abandoned the vantage point that let her see above the crowd. When Sansa accused Arya of inaction when their father was condemned to death, Arya doesn't mention how she jumped down from the base of Baelor's statue and fought through the crowd, trying to get to her father, and was only restrained by Yoren who, at Ned Stark's bidding, rushed over to protect her, shield her eyes from his execution, and get her out of King's Landing.\n\nArya recalls their father Eddard Stark watching from the catwalk while the boys practiced archery in the courtyard, then she practiced when the boys left but had to try many times to hit the target. While this is similar to the Stark family's first scene in the Season 1 premiere \"Winter is Coming\", it must be describing something that happened earlier: in that episode, Arya fired one arrow and hit the target, while her parents and the boys were still there. Arya says that Sansa didn't really watch the archery practice sessions because she was at the sewing circle with Septa Mordane, whom Joffrey executed along with the rest of Ned's household servants in King's Landing at the end of Season 1. In the Season 1 premiere, Arya snuck away from the sewing circle with Sansa and Mordane to watch the archery practice. In the novels, Arya actually isn't skilled at archery; in fact, she has not shot even one arrow in the novels. Fans have pointed out that her scene in Season 1 scoring a bull's eye on her target when Bran failed to contradicted this, as she isn't a preternaturally skilled archer with no training. This episode retroactively explains that she was simply practicing in secret for some time before that.\n\nOne of the faces Arya has created as magic Faceless Men shapeshifter masks is clearly the face of Walder Frey. It is unknown who the other faces are from.\n\nThe Inside the Episode video points out an additional reason for Sansa's shock when Arya starts speaking behind her, after she discovers her bag of faces: notice the camera clearly showed Sansa closing the only door into the room, but when the camera pulls back to reveal Arya, the door is still shut. Arya entered the room, and then closed the door behind her, so silently that Sansa didn't even notice despite only being a few feet away.\n\ndoor into the room, but when the camera pulls back to reveal Arya, the door is shut. Arya entered the room, and then closed the door behind her, so silently that Sansa didn't even notice despite only being a few feet away. Arya accuses Sansa that Lyanna Mormont is \"younger than you were\" when Cersei forced her to write the letter begging Robb to surrender, in exchange for their father's life. The passage of time between Seasons 6 and 7 is somewhat unclear, as is Lyanna Mormont's age. She was stated to be 10 years old in Season 5, but then described as 10 years old again in Season 6, even though other story elements seem to indicate that around a year passed between those seasons \u2013 it's possible that they were rounding, or that this was simply a dialogue error (repeating the line about her age without the TV writers taking the passage of time into account). Lyanna should have been 11 years old in Season 6, and at most 12 years old in Season 7 (assuming that one year passes each season, a pattern which generally held in prior seasons \u2013 but for all we know Season 7 might simply break with this and happen in a shorter timeframe). The matter is moot, however, because Sansa was stated in dialogue to be 13 years old in Season 1 \u2013 so whichever scenario, Lyanna is at most 12 years old now, and thus still \"younger\" than Sansa was.\n\nAlso regarding the passage of time, Sansa makes the only comment ever to address this in Season 7 itself, but only by vaguely saying that it has been \"weeks\" since Jon left Winterfell for Dragonstone. Given that months are composed of weeks, this could refer to anything from four weeks to four months \u2013 the TV writers may have been deliberately ambiguous about this.\n\nSansa says that they're asking \"20,000 men\" to fight for them. This doesn't seem to match prior numbers and is likely a hyperbolic remark or miscalculation on Sansa's part: earlier this season, Jon said there were fewer than 10,000 soldiers left in the North \u2013 though he was possibly referring to just the soldiers raised in the North itself, and not the large army from the Vale that came to Winterfell. Given that the Vale stayed neutral for most of the War of the Five Kings, until heading to Winterfell to help defeat the Boltons, it should have a full strength army in the range of 20-30,000 men (i.e. Robb could raise 20,000 men from the North in Season 1 when their armies were fresh, Tywin could raise even more in the south, etc.).\n\nArya suggests Sansa to play the game of faces - the game she used to play with the Waif (\"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\").\n\nThe Wight Hunt - Jon's group heading north, and back\n\nThe Wight Hunt \u2013 the battle\n\nThe initial skirmish with a scouting party explicitly reveals that the White Walkers and their undead horde are a keystone army: if a White Walker dies, any wights that it has personally reanimated will drop dead, the White Walker's magic no longer animating them. Assuming this effect filters throughout all ranks of the army, it would mean that if the Night King were to be killed, all the White Walkers he turned, and all subsequent Wights, would be killed, effectively annihilating the entire horde of the undead with a single blow. This hasn't been revealed yet in the novels \u2013 if it is even true in the novels \u2013 and may in fact be a massive, TV-first revelation.\n\nThe showrunners stated in the Inside the Episode video for the preceding episode that the Wight Hunt is \"an idea we came up with\" \u2013 in a context that almost assuredly means it won't actually happen in the next novel, but is an invention of the TV series. Similarly, in the Inside the Episode video for this episode itself, producer D.B. Weiss remarks on how they came up with the idea that Jon's search party gets trapped in the middle of a frozen lake - that they had to come up with this idea, it isn't based on something Martin told them about what happens in the next novel.\n\nhad to come up with this idea, it isn't based on something Martin told them about what happens in the next novel. Similarly, the climaxes for Seasons 5 and 6 \u2013 \"Hardhome\" and \"Battle of the Bastards\" \u2013 are large action sequences heavily featuring Kit Harington, but which probably won't actually happen in the novels. \"Hardhome\" certainly won't happen: Jon doesn't go to Hardhome in the current novels, and while an expedition was sent there, it won't involve him and will apparently happen off-screen. There is no guarantee that Jon will actually fight Ramsay Bolton in a future novel (anymore than it seemed that Robb Stark would face off against Joffrey Baratheon, but then didn't). It is entirely possible that Stannis Baratheon will defeat the Boltons in his upcoming battle against him, and that Theon Greyjoy may execute Ramsay (or they might all die, no one knows for sure). In the Blu-ray commentary and behind the scenes videos for these first two battles, showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss frequently remark that after the Battle of Castle Black, they were so impressed that actor Kit Harington can do his own stuntwork with swords that they wanted to show it off again, and remark on how impressed they are with how much emotion Harington can convey with his non-verbal facial reactions. Weiss even boasts in the behind the scenes video for \"Battle of the Bastards\" that \"It's got minimal dialogue in it!\". The battle scene, before Daenerys arrives, even uses a slow-motion shot to focus on Jon Snow, as Kit Harington reacts in wordless horror to the waves of wights overwhelming them. The showrunners have previously said in numerous videos that they avoid using slow motion whenever possible, feeling that it is a cheap trick, and have only sparingly used it a few times to convey extreme emotion during a battle (i.e. Jon focusing on Ygritte dying so much during the Battle of Castle Black that the camera slows down to shift to his perception, a slow-motion shot of Jaime watching men on fire flee Daenerys's dragon, which otherwise would happen too fast for the audience to experience as he does, etc.).\n\nThe entire battle scene, from when the wights start crossing the frozen lake to when Jon is saved by Benjen, lasts a full 9 minutes with no significant dialogue (other than shouts of \"Help!\", \"Fall back!\", etc.), instead focusing on the non-verbal reactions of the cast. After the battle begins, but before Daenerys arrives, consist of 5 full minutes of just Jon's party circled up and defending themselves from waves after wave of undead wights, with no dialogue \u2013 in contrast with the Massacre at Hardhome or Battle of the Bastards, which had more dialogue interspersed throughout, and incremental phases to each part of their battle sequences (i.e. at Hardhome, Jon tries to run into a building to retrieve dragonglass daggers, fails, then faces a White Walker, then new waves of wights appear).\n\nBenjen Stark dies for the last time, torn apart by wights, holding them off so his nephew Jon could escape on his horse. It is still unclear in the books what happened to Benjen, as he has not returned yet: the TV producers refer to him now as \"Coldhands Benjen\". In the books, \"Coldhands\" is a character who has similarly been reanimated but kept his own mind and free will due to the magic of the Children of the Forest, who helps Samwell Tarly and Bran Stark; he is definitely not a wight, since he can talk and his eyes are not glowing blue. There are three possibilities: either \"Coldhands\" really is Benjen, or perhaps Coldhands is a separate character setting up that Benjen will be reanimated in similar fashion, or this is just a pure invention of the TV series \u2013 it is currently unknown. When asked by his editor if Coldhands was Benjen, George R.R. Martin simply answered with a written message: \"NO\".\n\nThe wights' apparent aversion to water appears for the second time in this episode, the first being \"Hardhome\", where none of the Wights would chase Jon Snow or the Wildlings into the water. This is repeated again in this episode, when none of the Wights would initially chase the party into the lake after the ice cracks. In the novels, the Wights have no aversion to water: one of Cottor Pyke's letters to Jon Snow from the expedition to Hardhome states that there are \" dead things in the water .\" This episode, however, shows that water doesn't kill wights: when Tormund is swarmed by wights, two wights burst out of the frozen lake and try to drag Tormund under. One possibility that could simply be that wights can in fact operate in water, they simply cannot float or swim in it: when the dragons attack the wights and melt the ice, there is a shot that depicts dozens of wights sinking to the bottom of the lake. Furthermore, given the ending shot depicting the wights dragging Viserion's corpse out of the lake, it can be presumed some wights entered the water in order to attach the chains to the dragon's corpse.\n\n.\" This episode, however, shows that water doesn't kill wights: when Tormund is swarmed by wights, two wights burst of the frozen lake and try to drag Tormund under.

Furthermore, given the ending shot depicting the wights dragging Viserion's corpse out of the lake, it can be presumed wights entered the water in order to attach the chains to the dragon's corpse. This episode of course marks the first time that a dragon has died on-screen, Viserion the white dragon(Viserion isn't white on the show, instead golden in color). Dragons are nearly impervious to conventional weapons \u2013 but even in the backstory of the books, they have never been tested against Magic powers and weapons, like those of the White Walkers.\n\nIt is unclear why the Night King decided to throw an ice spear at Viserion, as opposed to Drogon, who was far closer and not airborne - and also evacuating the humans whose escape he was trying to prevent. It's possible he considered Viserion the more immediate threat because he was still actively attacking the White Walkers' army. He may also have considered that Drogon would have taken some time to take off anyway, making him still a potential target after killing Viserion, while Viserion and Rhaegal could have immediately left should Drogon had been killed first, being already in flight.\n\nThe weapons that the White Walkers wield, such as the ice-spear that the Night King uses to kill Viserion, are White Walker ice blades (they don't have a formal name). The books describe them as razor-thin shards of ice crystals, sharper than any human blade could ever be. George R.R. Martin has stated that they are made of \"ice\" - though only in the same sense that Valyrian steel is technically \"made out of iron\". Both are infused with spells that give them magical powers far beyond that: as Martin said, the White Walkers \"can do things with ice we can't imagine\".\n\nIn a subsequent interview, Emilia Clarke herself points out the irony that out of the three dragons, Viserion was the dragon who was killed and turned into a wight - given that he was named after Viserys, Daenerys's cruel brother who was brutally killed in Season 1 by Khal Drogo.\n\nGiven that the showrunners admitted that the Wight Hunt is an invention of the TV series, this introduces a massive and unresolved question: would the showrunners totally invent something on the scale of killing one of Daenerys's three dragons? Or, will Viserion be killed by the White Walkers in the novels, but in different circumstances? Or be killed by something else, or not at all? Such answers will, unfortunately, only be provided in the release of the next A Song of Ice and Fire novels.\n\nIn the books\n\n[This section will be updated with comparisons after the sixth novel is released.]\n\nMemorable quotes\n\nBeric Dondarrion: \"Death is the enemy.

{"label": true, "txt": "For much of the past year, Taylor Swift has kept a fairly low profile. So when she dropped her buzzy music video in August for \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d the first single off her forthcoming album Reputation, the Internet more or less lost its collective mind over it. This fervor was only intensified by the deliberate air of intrigue Swift cultivated: she cleared her social media accounts prior to the song\u2019s release and hasn\u2019t done any press for her new music \u2014 not even showing up to the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards where the \u201cLWYMMD\u201d video debuted.\n\nWith this aura of mystery surrounding Swift\u2019s new music \u2014 and her reference-laden music video \u2014 it should come as no surprise that fans have offered up plenty of theories about the album, due Nov. 10. While some of the theories are pure speculation, inspired by \u201clikes\u201d on Tumblr from Swift or her team, others are rooted in the imagery and lyrics of the attention-grabbing \u201cLWYMMD\u201d \u2014 and considering Swift\u2019s history of leaving secret messages for fans in her liner notes and elsewhere, there\u2019s reason to believe that some of them could be true.\n\nAhead of the album\u2019s release, we\u2019ve culled the best theories about Swift\u2019s new music.\n\nEach Taylor persona in her \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d video lineup corresponds to a song on the album\n\nSwift has confirmed that Reputation will include 15 tracks, with \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d listed as the 6th track on the album. Tumblr user darkbluetennesseas noted that Swift appeared to like a theory on the platform which stated that the 15 different versions of Taylor in the song\u2019s video might each correspond to a track on the album. It seems plausible, especially considering that the 6th Taylor in the lineup is one that claims to be gathering \u201creceipts,\u201d a seeming reference to the themes of exposure and distrust in the song. If this theory is to be believed, it follows that the 10th track might represent a more innocent Swift and the 5th one could touch on themes of victimhood.\n\nThe real Taylor Swift isn\u2019t actually a part of the lineup\n\nTumblr users were also quick to note that there was one Swift persona standing on the wing of her private jet in the background of the lineup shot, leading many to believe that that Swift represents who the singer really is right now. It\u2019s an especially salient point for Swift to make given her apparent move away from saccharine sweetness with the art and themes of Reputation, her edgiest album to date. This is also reinforced with the imagery of her past personas, many of whom represent certain eras or songs in her career, ranging from the nerdy ingenue in \u201cYou Belong With Me\u201d to an elegantly dressed, Met Gala-bound global celebrity known for her \u201csquad.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s hinting in \u201cLWYMMD\u201d that Calvin Harris once proposed to her\n\nA Tumblr user by the name of dallas-dante pointed out that in the \u201cLWYMMD\u201d music video, there appears to be jewelry that spells out the word \u201cno\u201d on one side of Swift\u2019s jewel-filled bathtub. On the other side, there seems to be a locket that resembles a necklace that Swift\u2019s former boyfriend Calvin Harris gave to her. Later in the video, there\u2019s an empty engagement ring box, leading fans to believe that Swift turned down a marriage proposal from Harris, though neither party ever spoke of one.\n\nSwift is aware of an Internet conspiracy theory that she died\n\nSwift is one of many celebrities who have been rumored to have been killed and replaced with a doppelg\u00e4nger (others include Miley Cyrus, Paul McCartney and perhaps most infamously Avril Lavigne.) Swift\u2019s decision to wipe her social media accounts and then post cryptic videos made one Reddit user think that she might really, as rumor has it, have died and been replaced, a notion some fans felt was corroborated by the much discussed spoken-word part of the song, during which she states that \u201cthe old Taylor can\u2019t come to the phone right now\u2026\u2019cause she\u2019s dead.\u201d One Tumblr user suggested that the death reference could also refer to a mural, shown below, that mocked the negative exposure Swift received after her beef with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West escalated.\n\nThe snakes flanking her in the \u201cLWYMMD\u201d video are a nod to perceptions of her after the Kimye Snapchat reveal\n\nIt\u2019s no big secret that Swift\u2019s favorite number is 13 (which also happens to be her birth date, in December), so it\u2019s interesting that in the \u201cLWYMMD\u201d video, she\u2019s flanked by just 12 snakes. Tumblr user lost-in-tays-land suggested that Swift is positioning herself as the 13th snake, a wry nod to the emoji that Kimye fans spammed her with after Kim Kardashian West released Snapchat footage of Swift talking to Kanye West on the phone about the infamous \u201cFamous\u201d line. (See here for the backstory on that feud.)\n\nThe graveyard suggests that Swift will no longer be hiding her work as a ghostwriter\n\nIn the video\u2019s opening graveyard scene, Swift\u2019s zombie persona is digging a grave next to a tombstone that has the pseudonym \u2014 Nils Sjoberg \u2014 she used when she wrote Calvin Harris\u2019 hit with Rihanna, \u201cThis Is What You Came For.\u201d While Swift didn\u2019t reveal that she had written the song until after she and Harris broke up, some fans theorize that the new Swift will be taking full credit for everything she does from here on out.\n\nThe graveyard also reveals how Swift feels about criticism of her collaborators\n\nIn the graveyard scene, Swift\u2019s music video director and longtime collaborator Joseph Kahn also has a tombstone. This could speak to how Kahn has also been heavily criticized for his work with Swift, most notably with the \u201cWildest Dreams\u201d video he directed, which was widely panned as a romanticized look at colonialism in Africa. If Swift\u2019s reincarnation as a take-no-prisoners boss in the following scenes are any indication, this could mean that she thinks he\u2019ll be rising above the haters, too.\n\n\u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d isn\u2019t about one of Swift\u2019s frenemies. It\u2019s about media scrutiny\n\nA Tumblr user pointed to the car crash in the \u201cLWYMMD\u201d video as a poignant visual declaration that Swift\u2019s revenge song might actually be about the media as opposed to longtime foes like Katy Perry or Kanye West. When Swift\u2019s persona in the video gets into a car crash, the paparazzi is more concerned with taking pictures of her than making sure she\u2019s okay. Along with Swift\u2019s album title, Reputation, and her album art, which features a collage of newspaper headlines of her name, it\u2019s fair to assume that we could be hearing more critiques of the media on other tracks on the album.\n\nThe tower of Taylors is Swift\u2019s answer to Kanye West\u2019s \u201cFamous\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like me and Taylor might still have sex/ Why? I made that b-tch famous\u201d: Call it the line heard \u2019round the world \u2014 or at the very least, the line that started what might be the greatest feud of a generation \u2014 but Kanye\u2019s lyric in \u201cFamous\u201d that name-checked Swift definitely hit a nerve with the pop star. While Swift addressed it pointedly during her Grammy acceptance speech for Album of the Year in 2016, by literally standing atop on a tower of her past selves from her different albums in the the \u201cLWYMMD\u201d video, she might be suggesting the way in which she\u2019s built her success and her fame of her own accord \u2014 not Kanye\u2019s.\n\nThe whole \u201cLWYMMD\u201d video is a Jacob\u2019s Ladder scenario\n\nVulture\u2018s Jesse David Fox has one of the more unusual theories about Swift\u2019s new music, but one that\u2019s plausible nonetheless. Fox maintains that the video is a Jacob\u2019s Ladder scenario (getting its name from the 1990 horror film) where something is so outlandish because it was, in reality, the dream of a dying person. This point is supported by Swift\u2019s line that she\u2019ll \u201cbe the actress starring in your bad dreams,\u201d and the phone call in which she says that \u201cold Taylor can\u2019t come to the phone right now\u201d because \u201cshe\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\nWrite to Cady Lang at cady.lang@timemagazine.com."}

John Mayer defended Justin Bieber and his decision to cancel the remainder of his Purpose World Tour during a recent interview with Variety, and it was so, so sweet. The \"Who You Love\" singer is known for being deep, sensitive, and sometimes not making sense when talking about Katy Perry during interviews. However, he made it known loud and clear that he supports Bieber's decision, and that we should, too. He said,\n\nWith touring dates, you hope you do them all, and I don't know his situation, but I appreciate the transparency. There are a hundred different reasons you can give for canceling a tour. I think the one that goes, 'I think I'm done' is the bravest and healthiest one.\n\nIf John Mayer says it, it must be true. AMIRITE? Mayer continued,\n\nYou can't send someone else to do the gig; you've got to do it. And at that age \u2014 I'm 39 and only now beginning to feel like I can weather the storm. You have to apply a certain amount of grace to younger people who are developing into that.\n\nMayer has been vocal about his support of Bieber's decision since the beginning. After it was announced that Bieber was canceling the remainder of the Purpose World Tour on July 24, he received a lot of backlash. He also got tons of support from fans worried about the \"Love Yourself\" singer's well-being, including John Mayer.\n\nMayer tweeted,\n\nWhen someone pulls remaining dates of a tour, it means they would have done real damage to themselves if they kept going. We've lost so many great artists lately. I give Justin [two thumbs up] for realizing it was time to call it. You should too.\n\nThe news of the canceled tour took a lot of people by surprise because Bieber had less than 20 shows left at the tail-end of an 18-month tour. In a statement to Elite Daily, Bieber's team said,\n\nDue to unforeseen circumstances, Justin Bieber will cancel the remainder of the Purpose World Tour concerts. Justin loves his fans and hates to disappoint them. He thanks his fans for the incredible experience of the Purpose World Tour over the last 18 months. He is grateful and honored to have shared that experience with his cast and crew for over 150 successful shows across six contents during this run. However, after careful consideration, he has decided he will not be performing any further dates. Tickets will be refunded at point of purchase.\n\nOne day, we may know the true reasoning behind Bieber canceling the rest of his tour. For now, we should all take note from John Mayer and give Biebs a break."}

{"label": true, "txt": "In the first episode of \u201cThe Arrangement,\u201d aspiring actress Megan Morrison (Christine Evangelista) is asked to settle a bet between two young businessmen dining at the restaurant where she waits tables. One is convinced that he\u2019s seen her in something, but his douchey buddy won\u2019t pay up until she delivers a line from one of her past roles.\n\n\u201cThat is a risk I\u2019m willing to take, Lieutenant, because last I checked all citizens are entitled to legal counsel,\u201d Megan says. \u201cEven vampires.\u201d\n\nEvangelista plays Megan as effortlessly cool \u2014 confident, with just a hint of vulnerability \u2014 and she\u2019s the main reason that the new E! scripted series is a delight to watch. The 10-episode drama, which premieres Sunday, is a thinly veiled spin on one of the biggest mysteries of our time: the whirlwind relationship between Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes, which some speculate was arranged by the Church of Scientology.\n\nFollowing a bizarre audition process, Megan is plucked from the obscurity of her side hustle and thrust into the limelight as the new girlfriend of superstar Kyle West (Josh Henderson), whose acting career is micromanaged by the Institute for the Higher Mind, a self-help organization clearly meant to evoke Scientology.\n\nKyle credits the institute, led by Terence Anderson (an oh-so-serious Michael Vartan), for his rise to fame, which followed family tragedy and months of sleeping in his car. When he meets Megan, he\u2019s fresh off a broken engagement to an A-list actress, whose path he will cross while promoting his latest film at the Venice Film Festival. The institute sets out to find Kyle a new leading lady, ostensibly for his next blockbuster, \u201cThe Kill Plan.\u201d Terence\u2019s wife, Deann (Lexa Doig), a producer on the film, has her eyes on Megan.\n\nAt her audition, Megan is asked three questions designed to reveal her \u201ctrue character.\u201d Assuming she flopped, Megan prepares for a weekend getaway with her boyfriend. But their plans are scrapped when a woman shows up to his house in tears, announcing that she\u2019s pregnant with his child. Reeling from her own unexpected breakup, Megan gets drunk with her two besties, and is surprised \u2014 and hung over \u2014 when her agent calls to tell her she will soon be reading opposite Kyle.\n\nMegan pulls it together and offers a raw, emotional (perhaps nausea-induced) performance. Impressed, Kyle runs after her and their whirlwind courtship begins with a paparazzi-dodging motorcycle ride, lunch at his favorite taco spot and a trip to a romantic Mexican bungalow.\n\nBy the end of the first episode, Megan has landed a contract proposal \u2014 but it\u2019s not for \u201cThe Kill Plan.\u201d The contract lays out the terms of what would eventually become a marriage \u2014 with a cool $10 million wrapped into the deal. \u201cThere\u2019s no big secret,\u201d Kyle insists. The contract is about his reputation and, he says with a wince, his brand. Despite warnings from her lawyer friend, Megan agrees to consider the offer \u2014 first accompanying Kyle to the film festival \u2014 because it beats waiting tables, and because she actually likes him.\n\nDespite the puppet strings attached to their union, Kyle and Megan have genuine chemistry. In fact, they can\u2019t keep their hands off each other, which presents a rather salacious theory for Cruise\u2019s crazy, couch-jumping appearance on \u201cThe Oprah Winfrey Show\u201d in 2005. \u201cThe Arrangement\u201d may be on basic cable, but there\u2019s a reason it doesn\u2019t come on until 10 p.m.\n\nDespite their connection, Megan and Kyle\u2019s relationship is complicated by interference from the institute \u2014 full of sinister motives that remain intriguingly obscure three episodes in \u2014 and the fact that Terence isn\u2019t sold on the pairing. But it\u2019s fun to watch their relationship unfold. In Italy, Megan is amused to learn that a tabloid has dubbed them \u201cKygan.\u201d When Deann says the moniker will undoubtedly lead to babies named Kygan, Megan replies, bewildered, \u201cThat\u2019s so saaaad.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s tension in the fact that, despite her aspirations, Megan doesn\u2019t appear to take her craft \u2014 or fame \u2014 as seriously as Kyle does. But it also seems that Megan, like pretty much everyone else in her orbit, is hiding something.\n\n\u201cThe Arrangement\u201d isn\u2019t top-tier television, but it\u2019s sharper than one might expect from the celebrity-obsessed network that brought us \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians\u201d and that weird Glambot thingamajig that forces the stars to strut their stuff in slow motion on awards show red carpets. (I\u2019ve never watched the network\u2019s other scripted series, \u201cThe Royals,\u201d but it gets fairly solid ratings).\n\nThat said, you will never, ever forget that \u201cThe Arrangement\u201d is an E! show. The opening scene is a faux E! news report about Kyle, featuring real-life reporters Zuri Hall and Jason Kennedy, who resurface in subsequent episodes.\n\nAnd the network has gone all out in building a backstory for the drama. A few days ago, in the name of research, I cued up a YouTube video of Cruise\u2019s infamous \u201cOprah\u201d appearance. The pre-roll ad was for an \u201cE! True Hollywood Story\u201d installment about (the fictional) Kyle West. Algorithms, smalgorithms \u2014 I prefer to think of it as me and the universe sharing an inside joke.\n\nBut honestly, \u201cThe Arrangement\u201d doesn\u2019t need all those cross-promotional bells and whistles. It\u2019s pretty delicious on its own.\n\nThe Arrangement (1 hour) Sunday, March 5 at 10 p.m. on E!"}

I have never seen June look that good,' he said, noting that the weight loss marked 'a dramatic change' in her appearance.\n\n'I'm proud of her,' he said, inviting her into his home for a chat.\n\nShocker: June's mother Sandra was shocked at her daughter's weight loss, but not for the better\n\nAs they conversed in the home, she told him, 'I hope you treat Jennifer better and that she never has to go through what me and the kids had to go through.'\n\nAs wedding guests arrived on the rainy day in the South, they, like Sugar Bear, were taken aback by June's drastic change in look.\n\nPumpkin said, 'Mama\u2019s going to flip a lid when she sees the people that Jennifer invited.'\n\nThose people included Mama June's sister-in-law, niece and mother Sandra Hale - the latter of whom she hasn't spoken to in three years amid searing tension.\n\nSandra didn't hold back her contempt for her daughter, taking cracks at her figure and hair within June's earshot.\n\nComic relief: Whenever issues ran deep, Alana was there to lighten the mood with her hysterical quips\n\nAfter they exchanged vows, Jennifer and Sugar Bear engaged in a long and passionate kiss, causing their guests to squirm in discomfort.\n\n'It was like a damn woolly mammoth eating a fish,' June said, while Jennifer glowed over her new spouse: 'I love my Mike, he knows how to kiss a woman.'\n\nAfter the ceremony, Kenya did his best to reunite Mama June with her estranged mother Sandra, but his overtures fell on deaf ears.\n\nKeeping the mood up: June's trainer Kenya wore many hats on the day - motivator, coach, peacemaker - as he accompanied his famous client to the nuptials\n\n'She said some things on the air that are untrue and I don't appreciate it,' Sandra said, while June later commented: 'I went through too much improvement in my life to let her back into my life.'\n\nMama June took the snubs in stride, wishing the two a happy marriage as she departed the scene.\n\n'I didn't kill anybody, I took the high road today,' a satisfied June said.\n\nAfter the wedding, June symbolically burned her old clothes in a bonfire in the woods, joking, 'That fire is smoking hot like me.'\n\nTension builds: (L-R) June, Alana and Kenya didn't know quite what to expect as they approached the wedding\n\nAlana tossed her mother's former underpants into the blaze, saying, 'Goodbye granny panties!\n\n'It fell really, really good to burn my clothes,' June said, showing her newfound self-discipline as she passed on a marshmallow roast.\n\n'I'm beginning to like the new Mama,' Alana said, 'especially if it means more marshmallows for me!'\n\nThe episode ended on a cliff-hanger, as Mama June was seen doubled over in 'excruciating' pain the morning after the wedding, complaining to Pumpkin and Alana of her misery.\n\nSaying goodbye: June was surrounded by her loved ones as she ceremonially tossed her old duds into a bonfire\n\n'I can't even get the f--- up. I'm gonna pass out,' she groused.\n\nPumpkin summoned June's bodyguard Luke to the premises, where they later called an ambulance to rush her to the emergency room.\n\nThe postscript will be revealed on a new Mama June special airing Friday at 8:30/7:30c on WeTV.\n\nUnder the weather: June was suffering the morning after the emotional affair, as her daughters flocked to her side"}
{"label": true, "txt": "Brazilian court rules Ryan Lochte can be prosecuted on charge of filing false report\n\nSAO PAULO -- The prosecution of U.S. swimmer Ryan Lochte for filing a false police report during the 2016 Olympics is back on after a Brazilian court decision this week.\n\nDuring the Games in Rio de Janeiro, the 12-time Olympic medalist told NBC that he and fellow swimmers were robbed at gunpoint in a taxi by men with police badges while returning to the Olympic Village from a party. But prosecutors said Lochte invented the story to cover up the swimmers' vandalism of a gas station and an ensuing confrontation with security guards. The confrontation was captured by surveillance cameras at the gas station.\n\nLochte later acknowledged that he was intoxicated at the time of the incident and that his behavior led to the confrontation.\n\nMartin Bureau/AFP/Getty Images Prosecutors said Ryan Lochte invented a story of being robbed at gunpoint to cover up vandalism of a gas station and an ensuing confrontation with security guards.\n\nThe initial claim appeared to confirm widespread fears before the Olympics that the event would be marred by rising crime rates in Rio de Janeiro, which has long struggled with violence. As Lochte's version of events began to shift, many Brazilians became annoyed that a false story about crime drew so much attention, when the city had hosted the Games without major problems.\n\nThe scandal drew international headlines and grew to overshadow the final days of the Games. Lochte ended up serving a 10-month suspension from the U.S. national swim team for his behavior.\n\nLast year, a court dismissed the case against Lochte, but the Superior Court of Justice reversed that decision Tuesday. Prosecutor Rodrigo de Almeida Maia said Thursday that the next step is for Lochte's lawyers to present their defense. Lochte does not have to appear in person to defend himself, de Almeida Maia said.\n\nSteve Lochte, the swimmer's father, said by telephone that he had no comment and directed questions to his son or his son's lawyers.\n\nJeff Ostrow, a lawyer who has represented Lochte in the past, did not immediately respond to an email and a voicemail message seeking comment. It was not clear whether he would represent Lochte in this case."}

DeGeneres teamed up with Lowe\u2019s to give the largest gift in her show\u2019s history to Texas\u2019 own Rockport-Fulton High School. The gift was revealed in a segment on DeGeneres\u2019 popular syndicated daytime TV show.\n\nThe money will be used to rebuild the high school\u2019s Harvey destroyed gym. It means the world to Rockport-Fulton\u2019s student-athletes.\n\n\u201cI spend more time in that gym than I do at home,\u201d senior volleyball player Allison Sanders said on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. \u201cLosing it was devastating.\u201d\n\nJ.J. Watt \u2014 the man who raised $37 million for Hurricane Harvey relief \u2014 weighed in with his own gushing praise for DeGeneres.\n\nLast August, DeGeneres committed $50,000 of her own money to Harvey relief and presented a $1 million check from Walmart to J.J. Watt\u2019s fundraising efforts.\n\nWhen the Category 4 storm made landfall in Rockport on August 25, Aransas County ISD suffered some of the most devastating damage of any of the Texas school districts. The eye of the storm passed directly over Rockport. The area was severely impacted, with $55 million in damages. Rockport-Fulton is the only high school in the town \u2014 and its gym nicknamed Gold Gym was leveled by the storm.\n\nDeGeneres surprised the high school\u2019s students on her show after playing a special video. Five Rockport-Fulton girl volleyball players shared their painful stories and commitment to helping their community.\n\n\u201cThe moment I realized how bad it was when we got pictures of our gym and realized it was just everywhere. It was like a second home for us, and to see it destroyed was so devastating,\u201d one student said.\n\nScenes of the girls playing volleyball were mixed in with Harvey footage, both of the storm itself and the entire town banding together to rebuild.\n\n\u201cBecause Rockport is such a tight-knit community, I think the need to help was so much greater,\u201d one student said in the video. It was that resiliency and determination that caught DeGeneres\u2019 eye. Student Sydney Macha first contacted the show\u2019s producers. Skype meetings with the program heads kicked off in February.\n\nAfter the video played, DeGeneres revealed that the high school students and volleyball coaches had gathered in the middle school. They believed they would be recording for Ellentube. You could say they were in for a surprise.\n\nDeGeneres recognized that the significance of the high school gym to all of Rockport\u2019s resilient citizens. \u201cI know that your gym was more than a gym to you,\u201d she noted. \u201cIt was important to your entire community.\u201d\n\nThe volleyball players updated DeGeneres on Rockport\u2019s progress, some through tears and others nervous about speaking to the celebrity. \u201cIt\u2019s Ellen!\u201d one laughed.

Right before the commercial break, the host teased that she had a big announcement.\n\nAs soon as the break was over, DeGeneres revealed the $1 million gift. The gym erupted in cheers, with students jumping up and down with joy as green and white confetti poured down \u2014 Rockport-Fulton\u2019s school colors.\n\nWith the donation, Lowe\u2019s Heroes from stores in the area will help build a new gym.

{"label": true, "txt": "CLOSE A look back on the talented player's NFL start and the series of events that ultimately resulted in his death. USA TODAY Sports\n\nFormer New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez (81) warms up before the start of the game against the Jacksonville Jaguars at EverBank Field. (Photo: Melina Vastola, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nAaron Hernandez grew up in Bristol, Conn., home of ESPN, and he had the sort of athletic gifts that would lead one day to SportsCenter highlights and multi-million-dollar contracts to play for the darlings of his region, the New England Patriots.\n\nBut the boy from Bristol also harbored demons of the sort that would one day lead him to drugs, accusations of cold-blooded murder and, finally, his own death. Authorities said he hanged himself with a bed sheet early Wednesday in the prison cell where he was serving a life sentence without possibility of parole. He was 27 and had lived an operatic hybrid of American dream and ghastly nightmare. His death came the same day his former team visited the White House to celebrate their Super Bowl victory two months ago.\n\nHernandez caught a touchdown pass in the Super Bowl in early 2012 \u2013 and the next year found himself accused of killing a semipro football player, Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. Motive remains unclear, though it may have been that Lloyd had some knowledge of Hernandez\u2019s link to a double homicide in the summer of 2012.\n\nLast week, Hernandez was acquitted of the most serious charges in that case, which would have only added to his life sentence because Massachusetts does not have the death penalty. Though, in the end, Hernandez apparently imposed his own.\n\nMORE COVERAGE:\n\nArmchair psychologists will long speculate what took Hernandez from a top target for Tim Tebow in college football to a top target for Tom Brady in the NFL and from there to a dark side of malevolent violence and unfathomable anger. Answers are ultimately unknowable but clues abound, beginning with the unexpected death of his father in 2006 when Hernandez was 16.\n\nDennis Hernandez was a high school custodian who died of complications arising from routine hernia surgery. The aftermath \u201cwas a mess with a lot of family issues, fighting and disagreements,\u201d Hernandez told USA TODAY Sports in 2009, when he was playing at Florida.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do for him,\u201d his mother Terri said in the same story. \u201cHe would rebel. It was very, very hard, and he was very, very angry. He wasn\u2019t the same kid, the way he spoke to me. The shock of losing his dad, there was so much anger.\u201d\n\nTrouble 'finds this guy'\n\nHernandez was an honor student at Bristol Central High School, though Doug Pina, his high school coach, told the Hartford Courant in 2010 that he\u2019d personally \u201calways had concerns\u201d about him.\n\nHernandez had originally planned to play college football for Connecticut, where his father and older brother played, but changed his mind and chose Florida. Before his first college game, Hernandez, then 17, punched a restaurant manager in the side of the head, busting his eardrum in a dispute over the bill. The case apparently settled out of court.\n\nHernandez also was among several Gators players interviewed by police after a shooting at a nightclub that left two men wounded. No one was ever charged.\n\nHernandez won a national championship and the John Mackey Award for the nation\u2019s best tight end during his time at Florida. He declared for the 2010 NFL draft where the Patriots took him in the fourth round, lower than his talent suggested he\u2019d go, apparently because of multiple failed drug tests and unsavory friends. CBSSports.com quoted an unnamed NFL scout: \u201cWe stayed away because we hated the people he hung out with and how trouble always finds this guy.\u201d\n\nMORE COVERAGE:\n\nPublished reports at the time said Hernandez had told teams at the NFL scouting combine that he\u2019d begun using marijuana to cope with the death of his father.\n\n\u201cWho do I talk to?\u201d Hernandez said of the uncertainty after his father\u2019s death in that 2009 USA TODAY Sports story. \u201cWho do I hang with?\u201d\n\nHe often hung with a bad crowd in years to come, including Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz. Rolling Stone styled them as \u201ctwo stumble-bum crooks with long sheets of priors.\u201d Wallace and Ortiz were with Hernandez when Lloyd was killed near Hernandez\u2019s Massachusetts home in 2013.\n\nFamily relationships were often complicated. Hernandez\u2019s cousin Tanya married Jeffrey Cummings in 2005; they had a son together and got divorced. Then, in 2009, Cummings married Hernandez\u2019s mother on a trip to Las Vegas. A year later, about a month before Hernandez reported to his first Patriots\u2019 training camp, Cummings slashed Hernandez\u2019s mother with a knife and she had lacerations to her face, shoulder and wrist. Cummings would wind up in jail and they would divorce.\n\nHernandez married Shayanna Jenkins in 2012 in the same month their daughter was born. That came only months after two Cape Verdean immigrants were gunned down in their car drive-by style after one of them bumped into Hernandez at a nightclub and spilled his drink.\n\nAlexander Bradley would say at trial that it was Hernandez who shot Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado \u2013 and Hernandez\u2019s lawyers would say it was Bradley who shot them. Bradley, not incidentally, had filed a civil suit in 2013 alleging that Hernandez shot him point-blank in the face months earlier, costing him his right eye. They were best friends before they were mortal enemies.\n\nTattoos tell story\n\nLast week, Hernandez wept after he was acquitted. It seemed out of character for a man who so often seemed devoid of any emotion. Reports at the time of his father\u2019s funeral said that Hernandez didn\u2019t cry, even as his brother and so many others did.\n\n\u201cThere was such hunger in that kid for a father\u2019s hand, and such greatness itching to get out,\u201d Rolling Stone\u2019s story said after Hernandez\u2019s arrest in 2013, \u201cthat coach after coach had covered for him whenever the bad Aaron showed \u2014 the violent, furious kid who was dangerous to all, most particularly, it seems, to his friends.\u201d\n\nKelly Whiteside wrote in her 2009 story in USA TODAY Sports that a guided tour of the tattoos on Hernandez\u2019s body reads like his autobiography.\n\nStarting from his right shoulder, she wrote, \u201cthere was a tattoo representing God\u2019s hands, a nod to his big brother and to his father and the day he died. There\u2019s the sun representing all the good days he had with his dad. Beneath those rays are clouds and rain.\u201d\n\nHernandez then pointed to the angels near his wrist. \u201cIt all ends in heaven,\u201d he said.\n\nHe\u2019d add more tattoos in the years ahead. One was of a smoking semi-automatic pistol. Another was of a six-shot revolver. That one accompanies two words, written in reverse: \u201cGod Forgives.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Aaron Hernandez's life"}

Frazer Harrison/Getty Images\n\nGwyneth Paltrow is receiving backlash for a recent Goop article about \"achieving your leanest livable weight.\"\n\nThe article drew criticism for appearing to equate health with thinness.\n\nOne Twitter user thought the article was promoting \"how to be as thin as possible without dying.\"\n\nThere's no question that the wellness advice Gwyneth Paltrow preaches on her website Goop are controversial. But for many readers, the website's recent article on how to obtain \"your leanest livable weight\" is taking controversy to a new level.\n\nThe 45-year-old actress and her lifestyle brand are under fire for promoting severe weight loss and teaching people \"how to be as thin as possible without dying,\" according to one critic. Last week, Goop published an article titled \"Busting Diet Myths.\" The article was promoted on its Twitter with the caption, \"Why diets don't work, the role of willpower, and achieving your leanest livable weight.\"\n\nImmediately, Paltrow and her website were slammed for advocating thinness and encouraging unhealthy weight loss. According to the article, a person's \"'leanest livable weight' is the weight at the low end of [one's] 'set range.' Your set range is a genetically determined range of weight that your body generally keeps you in.\"\n\nCritics took fault with the term leanest livable weight, which many believed translated into Goop encouraging its readers to slim down to the lowest weight they can maintain while still living.\n\nThough we can understand Goop's intention of giving advice on how to diet healthily, equating thinness with health is not the way to go. We agree with the internet on this one."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Arya Stark is a fictional character in American author George R. R. Martin's award-winning A Song of Ice and Fire epic fantasy novel series. She is a prominent point of view character in the novels, and is the only viewpoint character to appear in every published book of the series.\n\nIntroduced in 1996's A Game of Thrones, Arya is the younger daughter and third child of Lord Eddard Stark and his wife Lady Catelyn Stark. She is tomboyish, headstrong, feisty, independent, disdains traditional female pursuits, and is often mistaken for a boy. She wields a smallsword named Needle, a gift from her half-brother, Jon Snow, and is trained in the Braavosi style of sword fighting by Syrio Forel.\n\nArya is portrayed by English actress Maisie Williams in HBO's Emmy-winning television adaptation of the novel series, Game of Thrones.[1][2] Her performance has garnered critical acclaim, particularly in the second season for her work opposite veteran actor Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister) when she served as his cupbearer.[3] She is among the most popular characters in either version of the story.[4][5] Williams was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for the role in 2016.[6] She and the rest of the cast were nominated for Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2012, 2014, 2015 and 2016.\n\nCharacter [ edit ]\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nArya is the third child and younger daughter of Eddard and Catelyn Stark, and is nine years old at the beginning of the book series. She has four siblings: an older brother, Robb, two younger brothers Bran and Rickon, and an older sister, Sansa. She also grows very close to her bastard half-brother Jon Snow, who resembles her in looks and is also regarded socially as an outcast.\n\nDescription [ edit ]\n\nArya is left-handed and talented in sums and housekeeping, and is excellent at horse-riding. In contrast to her more praised sister Sansa, who favors activities traditionally befitting a noblewoman and expresses disdain for outdoor activities, Arya shows no interest in dancing, singing and sewing, and revels in fighting and exploring, much to the chagrin of her mother and household tutor Septa Mordane. She is described as \"wolf-blooded\", blunt, impulsive and \"always difficult to tame\" by her mother, and was given the nickname \"Arya Underfoot\" by the guards of Winterfell. She is particularly close to her bastard half-brother Jon Snow, who encourages her to learn how to fight and gives her the smallsword Needle.[7] The sword is well suited to Arya's slender build and her favored \"Water Dance\" (fencing) style which emphasizes speed and agility with a thin, light rapier used in quick thrusting attacks. Throughout her travels, Arya displays great resourcefulness and cunning, and also becomes increasingly ruthless.\n\nArya is the only one out of her full-siblings to inherit the Stark features and is said to resemble her late aunt Lyanna in both looks and temperament.[8] At the start of the series, she is generally regarded as messy and plain-looking, and often mistaken for a boy; but there are multiple instances in the books of her (favorable) comparison to the beautiful Lyanna,[8] and catching the eye of men later on in the series. She is also a skinchanger, capable of telepathically possessing her direwolf Nymeria in dreams, as well as psychically bonding with a street cat in Braavos.[9]\n\nStorylines [ edit ]\n\nNovels [ edit ]\n\nA Game of Thrones [ edit ]\n\nCoat of arms of House Stark\n\nArya is in love with her adopted direwolf cub, which she names Nymeria after a legendary warrior queen. She travels with her father, Eddard, to King's Landing when he is made Hand of the King. Before she leaves, her half-brother Jon Snow has a smallsword made for her as a parting gift, which she names \"Needle\" after her least favorite ladylike activity.\n\nWhile taking a walk together, Prince Joffrey and her sister Sansa happen upon Arya and her friend, the low-born butcher apprentice Mycah, sparring in the woods with broomsticks. Arya defends Mycah from Joffrey's torments and her direwolf Nymeria helps Arya fight off Joffrey, wounding his arm in the process. Knowing that Nymeria will likely be killed in retribution, Arya chases her wolf away;[10] but Sansa's direwolf Lady is killed in Nymeria's stead and Mycah is hunted down and killed by Sandor Clegane, Joffrey's bodyguard.[11]\n\nIn King's Landing, her father discovers Arya's possession of Needle, but instead of confiscating it he arranges for fencing lessons under the Braavosi swordsmaster Syrio Forel, who teaches her the style of fighting known as \"water dancing\". After her father's arrest, Syrio is killed protecting her and Arya narrowly escapes capture. She later witnesses the public execution of her father before falling under the protection of the Night's Watch recruiter Yoren.\n\nA Clash of Kings [ edit ]\n\nArya escapes King's Landing with Yoren and his party of recruits; and on the road, she clashes with the other Night's Watch child recruits Lommy, Gendry, and Hot Pie but eventually befriends them.[12] On the way, the party is attacked by Amory Lorch when Yoren refuses to yield Gendry, who is actually a bastard son of the late King Robert, to the Lannisters. The Night's Watch convoy is overrun and massacred, but Arya and the other children escape through a tunnel. Before escaping, she rescues three prisoners locked in a wagon cage, among them a mysterious man named Jaqen H'ghar.[13]\n\nArya and her friends are later captured by Ser Gregor Clegane and taken to Harrenhal as slave laborers.[14] After witnessing the torture death of her fellow prisoners, Arya begins nightly reciting the names of the people upon whom she wishes to exact revenge. At Harrenhal she re-encounters Jaqen, now under the employ of the Lannisters, who offers to kill for her any three people she names;[15] whereupon she names two people who hurt her at Harrenhal. When Jaqen asks her to name the last target, Arya extorts him to help her free northern prisoners by naming Jaqen himself as the third person. In order to get Arya to retract the name, Jaqen stages a massive prison riot that overwhelms the Lannister garrison. Afterwards, Jaqen offers to take Arya with him, but Arya expresses wish to go home, so he gives Arya a strange Braavosi iron coin to ensure her induction into his guild, the Faceless Men, and tells her to remember the passphrase \"Valar Morghulis\" (\"All men must die\" in High Valyrian) before leaving. The next morning, Roose Bolton captures the castle, and Arya becomes his personal cupbearer. Eventually, Arya escapes Harrenhal with her friends Gendry and Hot Pie after killing a guard.[16]\n\nA Storm of Swords [ edit ]\n\nWhile Arya and her companions are making their way north, she begins dreaming of her lost direwolf, Nymeria.[9] Later, she and her companions are discovered by the guerrilla group, the Brotherhood Without Banners, and is recognized as Arya Stark.[17] At the Brotherhood's secret base, Arya encounters Sandor Clegane, where she accuses him of Mycah's murder; but the Hound survives a trial by combat and is released.[18]\n\nArya eventually escapes the Brotherhood alone, but is captured by the Hound,[19] who plans to return her to her family for a ransom.[20] They reach the Twins just as her brother and mother are killed during the Red Wedding, and Sandor knocks her unconscious to prevent her from being killed.[21] That night, Arya skinchanges into Nymeria during sleep and pulls her mother's corpse out of the river for the Brotherhood to find. Later, Sandor plans to ransom her to her aunt Lysa at the Vale, but is unable to proceed due to the weather. Sandor decides to instead take her to her great-uncle Brynden Tully. On their way to Riverrun, they encounter two men on Arya's death list, Tickler and Polliver, who were both Gregor Clegane's men-at-arms at Harrenhal. In the ensuing fight, Arya personally stabs Tickler to death and reclaims her sword Needle from Polliver's corpse, but Sandor is severely injured. When Sandor becomes gravely ill from his wounds, Arya refuses to kill him and abandons him to die under a tree by the Trident river. She travels to the port town Saltpan and gains passage to Braavos on a merchant galleass, Titan's Daughter, by presenting the ship's captain with the iron coin that Jaqen gave her along with the Valyrian phrase \"Valar Morghulis.\"[22]\n\nA Feast for Crows [ edit ]\n\nArriving in Braavos, Arya makes her way to the headquarters of the Faceless Men, the House of Black and White,[23] where she is initiated into the guild by a priest in charge, whom she calls \"the Kindly Man\". The Kindly Man demands her to dispose of all her past possessions, and she complies by throwing in the river but still secretly hides her sword Needle, which is the one thing reminding of her sweet childhood memories. For her training, Arya adopts the identity of \"Cat of the Canal\", a street child who helps selling seafood, and continues having increasing more frequent and vivid wolf-dreams, which further prevents her from discarding her old identity.[24] During her training, she briefly meets Samwell Tarly and later murders the Night's Watch deserter Dareon.[25] After admitting her unauthorized killing to her mentor, she is given a milk potion to drink; the next morning, she wakes up blind.[26]\n\nA Dance with Dragons [ edit ]\n\nArya remains blind in the service of the House of Black and White for half a year. She continues to dream through the eyes of her direwolf, Nymeria, but speaks of it to no one. While she is blind, Arya wanders the streets of Braavos under the identity of \"Beth\", a blind beggar girl, and becomes better at sensing without her eyes, as well as lying and detecting the lies of others.[27]\n\nAfter skinchanging into a stray tomcat that followed her back to the temple, Arya is able to identify the Kindly Man as the person who sneak-attacks her with a stick every night and later surprise-hits him. For this achievement she passes the test and regains her vision,[27] and is given her first assassination assignment. When she successfully poisons a crooked insurance salesman without rousing any suspicion or collateral damage, the Kindly Man gives Arya an acolyte's robe and assigns her to begin her first apprenticeship inserted within a theatrical group.[28]\n\nThe Winds of Winter [ edit ]\n\nAn excerpt chapter from the yet-to-be-published sixth book of the series, named \"Mercy\", was released on George R. R. Martin's official website on March 27, 2014.[29][30] In the chapter, Arya, now taken the identity of an apprentice stage actress under the alias Mercedene (or \"Mercy\" for short), is performing a Braavosi theatrical play The Bloody Hand, a dramatized parody of the recent Westerosi political events in King's Landing, in which she plays a maiden (a whitewashed version of Shae) and rape victim of the titular evil dwarf Hand (a demonized version of Tyrion Lannister).\n\nWhen the Westerosi envoy led by treasurer Harys Swyft arrive in Braavos to negotiate with the Iron Bank for loans, Arya's theater group is employed to perform the play to entertain the guests. As the play is about to begin, Arya recognizes one of the envoy guards as Rafford, a former subordinate of Gregor Clegane also known as Raff the Sweetling, who is responsible for killing her injured friend Lommy. She seduces him and lures him to her own room, before stabbing his femoral artery and rendering him unable to walk. When Rafford begs for a healer, Arya cuts his throat in the same fashion as when he killed Lommy, and throws his corpse in a canal. She then heads back to perform the play, knowing this murder will most likely ruin her Mercedene identity.\n\nFamily tree of House Stark [ edit ]\n\nTelevision series [ edit ]\n\nLeft: The costumes worn by Arya and her companion Sandor Clegane in the TV series Game of Thrones.\n\nRight: Arya's The costumes worn by Arya and her companion Sandor Clegane in the TV seriesArya's smallsword \"Needle\" as shown in the TV series.\n\nArya Stark is portrayed by English actress Maisie Williams in the television adaption of the book series, this being Williams' first role as an actress.[31] Williams was chosen from among 300 actresses across England.[32]\n\nSeason 1 [ edit ]\n\nArya accompanies her father Ned and her sister Sansa to King's Landing. Before their departure, Arya's half-brother Jon Snow gifts Arya a sword which she dubs \"Needle\". On the Kingsroad, Arya is sparring with a butcher's boy, Mycah, when Sansa's betrothed Prince Joffrey Baratheon attacks Mycah, prompting Arya's direwolf Nymeria to bite Joffrey. Arya shoos Nymeria away so she is not killed, but is furious when Sansa later refuses to support her version of events. Mycah is later killed by Joffrey's bodyguard Sandor \"The Hound\" Clegane, earning him Arya's hatred. Ned arranges for Arya to have sword lessons with the Braavosi Syrio Forel, who later defends her from Ser Meryn Trant after Joffrey ascends to the throne and kills the Stark household. Arya flees the Red Keep, accidentally killing a stable boy in her escape, hiding out as a beggar in the streets of King's Landing. Ned is eventually taken to the Great Sept of Baelor to face judgment; he spots Arya in the crowd, and alerts the Night's Watch recruiter Yoren to her presence. Yoren prevents Arya from witnessing Ned's execution and has her pose as a boy as she joins Yoren's recruits on the march north.\n\nSeason 2 [ edit ]\n\nThe recruits are attacked by Lannister soldiers under Ser Amory Lorch, who have been ordered by Cersei Lannister to kill Robert Baratheon's bastard Gendry, who is part of the party. Needle is confiscated by a soldier, Polliver, who then uses it to kill Arya's friend Lommy Greenhands (who Arya later claims is Gendry). The recruits are taken to Harrenhal, where Tywin Lannister recognises her as a girl and takes her as his cupbearer. Jaqen offers to kill three people for Arya as reward for saving his life and those of his cellmates during the attack; Arya picks Harrenhal's torturer The Tickler and Ser Amory. When Arya is unable to have Tywin killed before his departure, she has Jaqen help her, Gendry and her friend Hot Pie escape. Jaqen offers to take Arya to Braavos to join the Faceless Men assassin guild, and although she declines he gives her an iron coin that will allow her to obtain passage to Braavos.\n\nSeason 3 [ edit ]\n\nArya, Gendry, and Hot Pie encounter Thoros of Myr, a Red Priest who is a member of the Brotherhood Without Banners, a group of men sent by Ned to restore order in the Riverlands. As Thoros takes them to the Brotherhood's hideout they encounter the Hound, a captive of other Brotherhood men. The Hound is brought before the Brotherhood's leader, Ser Beric Dondarrion, and after Arya accuses him of Mycah's murder Beric sentences him to trial by combat. The Hound wins, to Arya's fury, and is released by Dondarrion. Arya is further enraged when the Brotherhood sells Gendry to Melisandre and escapes the Brotherhood. She is captured by the Hound, who intends to take her to The Twins to ransom her to her brother Robb. However, as they arrive the Freys betray the Starks and slaughter their forces, with Arya barely escaping the massacre. In the aftermath of their escape, Arya encounters a Frey soldier bragging about his role in desecrating Robb's corpse. Arya stabs the soldier to death, marking the first time she has deliberately killed another person.\n\nSeason 4 [ edit ]\n\nArya and the Hound encounter Polliver in a tavern; Arya reclaims Needle and uses it to kill Polliver to avenge Lommy. They also encounter Rorge and Biter, Jaqen's fellow prisoners, and Arya kills Rorge after recalling he had threatened to rape her. The Hound takes Arya to the Vale to ransom her to her aunt Lysa Arryn, only to be turned away at the Bloody Gate when they are informed that Lysa has apparently committed suicide. Returning from the Bloody Gate, they are approached by Brienne of Tarth, who had sworn to Catelyn Stark to take Arya to safety. Distrusting Brienne's allegiances, the Hound attempts to kill her but is severely beaten and is seemingly mortally wounded. Arya manages to hide from Brienne in the confusion, and after Brienne leaves, Arya takes the Hound's silver, leaving him to die. She then encounters a Braavosi captain, who offers her passage to Braavos after she gives him the iron coin.\n\nSeason 5 [ edit ]\n\nArya arrives in Braavos and is accepted into the House of Black and White by a man who wears Jaqen H'ghar's face. After impressing Jaqen with her ability to lie undetected by convincing a terminally ill girl to drink poison, she is given the assignment of assassinating a corrupt insurance salesman. However, she is distracted from her mission by the arrival in Braavos of Ser Meryn Trant. Assuming the identity of the girl she had poisoned, Arya disguises herself as a prostitute and infiltrates a brothel, where she kills Meryn. However, when she returns to the House of Black and White she is caught by Jaqen, who chides that Arya has not dissociated from her identity and that as a result wearing another person's face will poison her. Arya is subsequently struck blind.\n\nSeason 6 [ edit ]\n\nArya is forced to beg on the streets of Braavos, with her fellow acolyte the Waif arriving daily to attack her. Eventually, Jaqen brings Arya back to the House of Black and White and restores her vision. She is tasked to assassinate an actress named Lady Crane, but Arya has a change of heart at the last minute, instead warning Lady Crane of the attempt on her life. The Waif witnesses this disobedience, and is given permission by Jaqen to kill Arya. Aware that she is now in danger, Arya retrieves her sword Needle from its hiding place and arranges for passage out of Braavos, but is stabbed by the Waif and barely escapes. Lady Crane nurses her back to health, but the Waif reappears, kills Lady Crane and pursues a recovering Arya. Arya leads the Waif to her quarters underneath Braavos and extinguishes the only candle in the room, her experience fighting blind ultimately giving her the advantage and allowing her to kill the Waif. She removes the Waif's face and adds it to the Hall of Faces before telling an impressed Jaqen that she is Arya Stark, and returns to Westeros.\n\nArya travels to the Twins, assuming the identity of a servant girl. She kills Lord Walder Frey's sons, Black Walder Rivers and Lothar Frey, before cooking them in a pie that she serves to Walder Frey. After revealing her subterfuge and her true identity to Walder, she cuts his throat, avenging Robb and Catelyn.\n\nSeason 7 [ edit ]\n\nTaking the face of Walder Frey, Arya gathers the men of House Frey for a feast before killing them all with poisoned wine. Arya then journeys south, intending to travel to King's Landing to assassinate Cersei (now Queen of the Seven Kingdoms following the extinction of House Baratheon). However, Arya changes her mind after learning from Hot Pie that Jon has ousted House Bolton from Winterfell and has been crowned King in the North, and decides to return to her ancestral home. Along the way she encounters a wolf pack led by her long-lost direwolf Nymeria. Nymeria recognizes Arya, but she has grown feral and ignores Arya when she asks her to come North with her.\n\nArriving at Winterfell, Arya finds that Jon has traveled to Dragonstone but is reunited with Sansa and Bran, the latter of whom reveals his knowledge of Arya's kill list through greenseeing and presents her with a Valyrian steel dagger, which had been given to him by Littlefinger. Arya is also reunited with Brienne, who continues to serve the Starks, and manages to equal the female warrior during sparring despite her smaller size.\n\nLittlefinger seeks to increase his influence on Sansa by driving a wedge between the Stark sisters. To this end, he allows Arya to witness him receiving a confidential message obtained from Maester Luwin's records. Arya breaks into Littlefinger's quarters to steal the message, which is a plea sent by Sansa following Ned's imprisonment to Robb imploring him to bend the knee to Joffrey. Arya, outraged, confronts Sansa, and is unconvinced by her explanation that she did so to try and save Ned's life. Later, Arya catches Sansa looking at her collection of faces, and threatens Sansa before leaving. Some time later, Sansa summons Arya to the great hall and begins an accusation of treason and murder; however, the accusation is directed towards Littlefinger, whose crimes have been discovered by Bran's greenseeing. Despite Littlefinger's pleas for mercy, Arya cuts his throat with the Valyrian steel dagger and Sansa's approval. The Stark sisters later resolve their differences, and acknowledge that the Starks must stay together to survive winter.\n\nRecognition and awards [ edit ]\n\nMaisie Williams has received several award nominations for her portrayal of Arya. For her performance in the series she received two Portal Awards for Best Supporting Actress and Best Young Actor in 2012,[33] an EWwy Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2014,[34] and a Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Young Actor in a Television Series in 2015.[35]\n\nWilliams was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2016.[36] Other nominations include the Portal Award for Best Young Actor in 2011,[37] the SFX Awards for Best Actress in 2012 and 2015,[38][39] the Gold Derby TV Awards for Breakthrough Performer of the Year in 2012,[40] the Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a TV Series by a Supporting Young Actress in 2013,[41] the EWwy Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2015,[42] and the Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Young Actor in a Television Series in 2016.[43]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nThis article incorporates text available under the CC BY-SA 3.0 license."}

That doesn't mean she is going to rag on their new song, though.\n\nWhen asked what she thinks of \"Down,\" Cabello replied,\n\nI've heard some snippets of it. I haven't had a chance to hear the whole thing, but I thought it was pretty cool.\n\nNot to be harsh, but the song, which features Gucci Mane, is three minutes and 14 seconds. I find it suspect that a singer, who inevitably rides in cars to interviews and award shows and hops on planes and maybe even goes to the gym to workout while listening to music, hasn't had three minutes and 14 seconds to listen to the song in its entirety in the past two weeks...\n\nAnyway, Cabello went on to call the song \"a natural evolution,\" saying it's not weird for her that her vocals are missing from the track.\n\nShe also said,\n\nI wish the best for them and I'm sure they're going to kill it, and I'm super happy making my own music.\n\nCabello's first solo album, The Hurting The Healing The Loving, will be released later this year.

{"label": true, "txt": "Tiffany Pollard (born January 6, 1982),[1][2] sometimes known by her nickname New York, is an American reality television personality and actress. She first achieved public recognition for her participation in VH1's Flavor of Love and I Love New York.\n\nPollard was given the nickname \"New York\" by rapper Flavor Flav. She is also known colloquially by her self-proclaimed nickname, the \"HBIC (Head Bitch In Charge)\",[3] which she exclaimed in the Flavor of Love series to taunt her competitors.[4]\n\nIn 2016, Pollard took part in the British television series Celebrity Big Brother, finishing in fourth place. She was a cast member in the reality television series The Next:15. She and her mother were main cast members in the first season of the reality show Family Therapy with Dr. Jenn. On November 3, 2016, it was announced that she joined the second season of E! reality show Famously Single.\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nPollard was born in Utica, New York to Michelle Rothschild-Patterson (also known as \"Sister Patterson\") and Alex Pollard.[5] Pollard has used the surnames of both her parents, who are unmarried.[6] She attended John F. Kennedy Middle School and graduated from Thomas R. Proctor High School.[7]\n\nPollard was engaged to I Love New York season 1 winner Patrick \"Tango\" Hunter for a six-month period until Hunter called off the engagement on the reunion show.[8] She was also engaged to George \"Tailor Made\" Weisgerber, the winner of I Love New York 2. On September 8, 2008, she announced on episode 6 of her show, New York Goes to Hollywood, that she had officially separated from Weisgerber.[9]\n\nIn an episode of Brunch with Tiffany, Pollard revealed that she has bipolar disorder.[10]\n\nTelevision appearances [ edit ]\n\n2006: Breakthrough with Flavor of Love [ edit ]\n\nFlavor of Love [ edit ]\n\nPollard clashed with virtually all the other contestants. Although these feuds were, in general, nothing more than screaming matches, an incident in the penultimate episode of season one led to violence. After her elimination, an outraged Brooke \"Pumkin\" Thompson spat on Pollard after the two had exchanged words.[11] Pollard vowed to \"whoop Pumkin's ass\", and attempted to do so at the season one reunion.[12] The moment was rated number one on various VH1 and MTV reality show specials, including VH1's 20 Greatest Celebreality Fights.[citation needed] The final two contestants journeyed to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico where Flavor Flav chose Nicole \"Hoopz\" Alexander over Pollard, to be his mate.[13]\n\nFlavor of Love 2 [ edit ]\n\nAfter his relationship did not work out with Alexander, Flavor Flav chose to do a second season of his dating show and invited Pollard to help him eliminate contestants halfway through the season. She agreed and was later added as a participant.[14] In the finale, Flav chose Deelishis over Pollard.[15] Pollard verbally fought with Flav in the season finale, asking why he had brought her back only to be ultimately eliminated.[16]\n\n2007\u20132009: VH1 Spinoffs [ edit ]\n\nI Love New York [ edit ]\n\nI Love New York was Tiffany Pollard's first reality television series on VH1. The series is a spin-off of another relationship competition series, the Flavor of Love, which featured Pollard as a finalist in two consecutive seasons. In July 2006, VH1 published a casting call for contestants for a new series tentatively titled The Flavorette. Various blogs speculated that the star of this program could be Flavor of Love season 1 contestant Rain, Hoopz (Nicole Alexander) or Pollard. Before the season 2 Flavor of Love finale, Pollard denied having her own show but after the finale aired, she confirmed she was the \"Flavorette\" and that she was already down to the final three contestants. The show premiered on Monday, January 8, 2007 and was the most-watched series debut in VH1 history with 4.426 million viewers.[17] Its season 1 finale brought in 4.8M million viewers and its reunion show ratings held 5.01 million viewers. Spin-offs from the series include I Love Money, New York Goes to Hollywood, Real Chance of Love, New York Goes to Work, and Frank the Entertainer in a Basement Affair.\n\nI Love New York 2 [ edit ]\n\nI Love New York 2 premiered October 8, 2007 on VH1.[18] In the finale of I Love New York 2, contestant \"Tailor Made\" (real name George Weisgerber) proposed to Pollard, but was turned down. The finale earned 5.4 million viewers. During the I Love New York 2 reunion special, Tailor Made proposed a second time and Pollard accepted. The reunion special earned 4.86 million viewers.[19][20]\n\nNew York Goes to Hollywood [ edit ]\n\nNew York Goes to Hollywood premiered August 4, 2008 on VH1. The eight episode season follows Pollard as she tries to establish herself as an actress in Hollywood, California.\n\nNew York Goes to Work [ edit ]\n\nNew York Goes to Work premiered on May 4, 2009. The reality show followed Pollard as she searches for a regular job.[21] The jobs were selected by fans (via text messaging) from a list of three possible jobs for each episode. Pollard would receive a $10,000 bonus each week if she were able to impress her employer. However, if she quit, failed or was fired, she would not receive a bonus for the week. Pollard won $45000 over the series, earning bonuses in 4 jobs (in episodes 1, 2, 5 and 6); losing, failing in, or quitting 4 jobs (in episodes 3, 4, 7 and 8); and coming to a draw in the season finale. At the end of the series, a mobile poll was presented giving three choices for New York's next task, and the most votes were cast for I Love New York 3.\n\nI Love New York 3 [ edit ]\n\nProduction for I Love New York 3 was set to kick off sometime in the first quarter of 2010; however, prior to that time frame, VH1 requested immediate cancellation on the Celebreality franchise and shelved plans for I Love New York 3. In the summer of 2011, Pollard hinted that I Love New York 3 was cancelled due to the murder-suicide case of Ryan Jenkins, who was a former contestant of Megan Wants a Millionaire.[22]\n\n2015\u2013present: Reality television comeback [ edit ]\n\nOn April 14, 2015, Pollard appeared on an episode of the E! Network's series, Botched, where she details her botched surgeries that have left her breasts sagging with extra skin. She appears on the show in hopes of getting them corrected, so she may resume her reality TV career.[3][23][24]\n\nOn January 5, 2016, Pollard entered the Celebrity Big Brother house in the United Kingdom to participate in the seventeenth season of the show. She was involved in an infamous misunderstanding in which Pollard believed that David Gest had died of cancer inside the house; it subsequently turned out to be David Bowie that had died, the ex-husband of fellow housemate Angie Bowie.[25] Throughout her time on the show, Pollard proved popular with the British public, and achieved the most votes to save over her fellow contestants on at least one occasion. On February 5, Pollard made the final and came in fourth place - ranking higher than any other American female who had been on the show.[26] Due to her popularity on the show, Pollard appeared in many UK publications including New! magazine. She also became a regular fixture on the Big Brother spin off show Big Brother's Bit on the Side during Big Brother 17 (UK).\n\nIn January 2016, Pollard was announced as a main cast member on TV One's The Next :15 which premiered on February 10, 2016.[27] In February 2016, Pollard was announced as a cast member on the first season of Family Therapy with Dr. Jenn which premiered on March 16, 2016 on VH1. In August 2016, it was announced that Pollard would host new gay dating show, The Ex in which she also served as executive producer. The show hasn't been picked up by a network yet.[28][29] On February 9, 2017, Tiffany's VH1 digital series Brunch with Tiffany premiered. The series follows Tiffany as she informally interviews a celebrity guest over brunch. The pilot featured Real Housewives of New York star Sonja Morgan.[30]\n\nIn August 2017, it was announced that Pollard would compete in the first season of VH1's Scared Famous, which premiered on October 23, 2017.[31]\n\nSeveral images and GIFs of Pollard, taken from her various VH1 appearances, have developed into internet memes on social network sites such as Tumblr and Twitter.[32] A notable example includes \"New York on a Bed,\" which became a popular meme on Twitter used to express emotions of frustration and discomfort as well as moments of awkwardness.[33]\n\nActing career [ edit ]\n\nPollard's first movie role was in 2008, in the comedy First Sunday. She appeared in a supporting role, acting alongside Ice Cube, Regina Hall, and C. J. Sanders.\n\nPollard participated in a 2009 national tour of the Vagina Monologues with an all-black cast, most of whom are also former reality show contestants.[34] Pollard has also appeared in a play called The Clean Up Woman in 2009, and The Trial of The Chicago 7 in 2010.\n\nFilmography [ edit ]\n\nFilm [ edit ]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2008 First Sunday Client As Omunique's Client 2014 The Shop Kiana\n\nTelevision [ edit ]\n\nTheater [ edit ]\n\nWeb [ edit ]\n\nYear Title Notes 2017\u2013present Brunch with Tiffany Host; on VH1's YouTube channel"}

{"label": true, "txt": "When I revealed in this column last year that Dame Helen Mirren was the new face of L\u2019Oreal, I had hundreds of letters from readers, ecstatic that beauty giants are celebrating older women.\n\nAs these exclusive pictures show, from next week (February 5) Helen will be appearing in her first television advertising campaign for the company.\n\nThe 69-year-old actress will be seen championing the role of the older woman \u2014 and the candid, unretouched shots from the advert show that wrinkles, ageing hands and natural make-up can be beautiful.\n\nScroll down for video\n\nDame Helen Mirren photographed for the L'Oreal Paris age perfect campaign. In this shot Helen wears the Age Perfect day cream, the candid, unretouched shots are a refreshing change and champion the beauty of the older woman\n\nI suspect this approach will sell more products than the glossier, airbrushed campaigns that many women feel don\u2019t relate to them and their real lives.\n\nDuring the filming of the advert, Dame Helen took time out to speak exclusively to us about what she really thinks about beauty \u2014 and reveals she doesn\u2019t even like the word!\n\nShe told us: \u2018I used to worry a lot more about my looks than I do now.\n\n\u2018I think the great advantage of getting older is that you let go of certain things. Having said that, I think all women worry to some degree \u2014 and I don\u2019t think men are exempt.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t really like the word \u201cbeauty\u201d. There are physically beautiful people in the world (David Beckham, for instance, is unbelievably beautiful), then there are other people that are not beautiful, but are very attractive because of their personality, energy, brilliance, genius: all kinds of things.\n\nHelen (pictured for the L'Oreal campaign) says she used to worry about her looks but as she's aged she's learnt to let go of certain things\n\n\u2018So I have a resistance to the word \u201cbeautiful\u201d. I wish we could find another word that takes it away from physical beauty and brings it more into the world of true attractiveness.\u2019\n\nDame Helen also told of her shock at being asked to be the face of L\u2019Oreal. \u2018I was surprised \u2014 but flattered as I am a fan of the brand and its products.\n\n\u2018I love make-up. I\u2019m often seen prowling the aisles of various chemists all over the world looking for a new lipstick or a new mascara, so to become a spokesperson for a major cosmetics firm is very exciting.\n\n\u2018I think L\u2019Oreal\u2019s slogan \u201cBecause I\u2019m Worth It\u201d really strikes a chord with women. Self-esteem is such a hugely important thing and it\u2019s so difficult for all of us.\n\nDame Helen's much admired hair colour is now maintained by L'Oreal Excellence Age Perfect\n\n\u2018Everybody has moments of massive insecurity and I think anything that makes you feel more confident and more secure in yourself is a great thing. It\u2019s tough for a lot of women with busy schedules or limited resources: they are incredibly busy and have difficult lives. To stop for a few seconds to say: \u201cYou know what, I can sit down, have a breather, a cup of tea or a bath and think \u201cYes, I\u2019m worth it, my life is worth it\u201d is so important.\n\n\u2018People say to me \u201cOh, you\u2019re so self-confident\u201d but I am not naturally self-confident, I just have had to be in my work and my life. If it\u2019s a problem, it\u2019s my problem \u2014 I\u2019ve got to deal with it.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s this refreshing honesty that makes Helen the perfect figurehead for older women. So was there an age at which she started to feel differently about the way she looked?\n\n\u2018My whole life has been slightly different from most people\u2019s in the sense that I\u2019ve always had to look at images of myself from when I was 21 years old,\u2019 she said.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve either been in front of a camera or in the theatre, being photographed, having my picture in the paper, so I\u2019ve grown up with what I look like and ageing has never sort of come as a shock.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not obsessive when it comes to looking after my skin. I have always used moisturiser at night and in the morning \u2014 it makes me feel better and to me that\u2019s what I want from it.\n\n\u2018It doesn\u2019t have to make me look ten years younger: it\u2019s all about how it makes me feel better that day.\n\n\u2018My biggest beauty advice is just to make sure you clean your skin really well and don\u2019t smoke. I also have to have my eight hours of sleep a night.\u2019\n\nWhile her new role as an ambassador for the beauty brand hasn\u2019t changed Helen\u2019s skincare regime, what has changed is her hair.\n\nDame Helen is pictured here at the Golden Globe awards two weeks ago, accompanying her stylist dress with a slash of bold red lipstick\n\nFor the initial print campaign, she was given a stylish crop, and her much-admired bright blonde is now maintained using L\u2019Oreal\u2019s new Excellence Age Perfect hair colour.\n\n\u2018I have very fine hair so I\u2019ve always been quite careful not to overtreat it. I don\u2019t normally colour or dye it, I like it to grow naturally, but this dye is fantastic. It really does what it says on the box, allows my hair to grow out naturally and is also very easy to use. It\u2019s my new favourite product.\n\n\u2018Yes, I know it sounds like I\u2019m saying it because of the advertising, but it\u2019s true! The brilliant thing is that it has layers of colour, it\u2019s not one colour that you then need to add highlights on top of.\u2019\n\nSo what hair advice would she give to somebody who, like her, is in their 60s?\n\n\u2018Be bold! Be bold with your cut, really look what young people are doing and copy them \u2014 don\u2019t copy what old people are doing.\n\nSeen here last year, Helen is clearly a fan of a statement lip. She says her advice to women out there is to look at what's happening now style-wise and 'go with the flow'\n\n\u2018I loved it when I dyed my hair pink. A lot of women get stuck at what they are good at and what they did between the ages of 18 and 28 and they never have the courage to change that.\n\n\u2018You see women from the Sixties still with their beehives and now they\u2019re in their 70s. You see women from the Eighties who still have those Eighties hair-dos. My advice is to look at what\u2019s happening now and go with the flow \u2014 don\u2019t do what you did when you were 24.\n\n\u2018Some people have a classic haircut and it works for them and that\u2019s great, but it\u2019s much better to accept how you look now and then be modern.\u2019"}

{"label": true, "txt": "Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Laura Wasser is known around Hollywood as the \"Disso Queen,\" as in dissolution of marriage. As in d-i-v-o-r-c-e.\n\nThe first marital dissolution she ever handled was her own, in 1993. She met a guy while she was at Loyola Law School, married him, and it lasted a year. She filed the paperwork as soon as she passed the bar, landing -- permanently, she says -- in Splitsville.\n\nThe divorce was simple. There was no money to wrangle over, no kids. Still, Wasser vowed she'd never get divorced again because she'd never get married again.\n\n\"Everybody should get married -- once,\" Wasser said. \"I was 25.\"\n\nThese days, Wasser is a divorce lawyer to the stars and there's much more to fight over: Millions of dollars, high-end property, children blessed by the gene pool -- not to mention reputations that can anchor a record label or movie franchise.\n\nShe's currently trying to hammer out a settlement for Mel Gibson's wife, Robyn, and recently had dinner with Gibson's criminal lawyer, Blair Berk.\n\nShe dropped Britney Spears (another Berk client) when the pop star wouldn't follow her advice during a 2008 custody dispute. Before that, in 2003, she helped Angelina Jolie break away from Billy Bob Thornton with only the tiniest ripple of gossip.\n\nFollow CNN.com's Lawyers to the Stars series\n\nWasser is 42 now and is raising two boys at her home in the Hollywood Hills. The father of the youngest child lives with her. The father of the older boy is a friend and he visits often, she said. It's her family, as she defines it.\n\nShe is a second-generation celebrity lawyer. Her father, Dennis Wasser, handles the family affairs of studio moguls and billionaires. She works at his firm, giving the families of broken-hearted rockers and TV and movie stars the same TLC her father showers on their bosses.\n\nShe's also a devoted fashionista, and unlike most other celebrity lawyers, has been known to walk the red carpet on occasion. In July, she was featured in Vogue.\n\n\"My mom said I can die happy because I was in Vogue,\" Wasser said.\n\nShe was conceived on the night her father passed the California Bar exam (\"My parents did the math,\" she noted) and Dennis Wasser knew his little girl would follow in his footsteps. Her father chose the name Laura Allison Wasser so the initials would spell L.A.W.\n\n\"My mom wanted to name me Rebecca,\" she added. But then, her initials would have been R.A.W. meaning her destiny would be \"What -- a porn star?\" she joked. A sushi chef?\n\nIn the bureaucracy of law firms, most of the paperwork is identified by the initials of the lawyer generating it. \"There's another Laura in the office, so everyone just calls me \"Law,\" Wasser said.\n\nWasser and her younger brother grew up in Beverly Hills, attending high school with the privileged scions of Hollywood studio heads, agents, producers and directors. Her parents moved there when she was 6 because the schools were so good, she said. But, she insisted she wasn't spoiled, even if she is by her own admission \"a major clothes horse.\"\n\n\"A lot of these kids we were in school with got huge allowances and there was a car with a big bow on it in the driveway when they turned 16 and I couldn't for the life of me figure out why I was so deprived,\" Wasser recalled.\n\nShe had to negotiate for her car, agreeing to get a job to help pay the insurance. Then, she said, she wrecked the car, anyway. She also had to negotiate her allowance and curfew. She realizes now that the first seeds of a legal career were being planted.\n\n\"I'll tell you, I never thought I'd ever be going into law, and certainly not the same kind of law as my dad,\" she said. \"When I started clerking here, it kind of clicked. When you grow up with it, it's in your blood.\"\n\nBecause she was raised in zip code 90210, Wasser is familiar with the territory her clients tread. Besides, she said, \"Dissolution and custody matters are the great equalizers.\"\n\n\"Having done this for a while, you do realize that everybody has the same issues,\" she explained. \"It doesn't matter how much money you have or how much power you have, you are always afraid you're never going to see your child.\"\n\nShe advises her famous clients to try and work out a settlement because once legal papers are filed, marital discord becomes a matter of public record. She tells clients to remember what they once saw in the other person.\n\n\"Take yourself back to either when you were in dating, or when you were in the delivery room holding her hand. There must something you liked about him or her,\" she advises.\n\n\"In the midst of it, they hate each other because they're still in an adversarial position. As soon as the deal is done, people start liking each other more.\"\n\nAnd, she reminds clients that money they're paying her could be going to their kids. When they tear at each other in her office, she tells them to take it to a counselor. \"I'm not qualified. A counselor charges $150 an hour, and that's a whole lot cheaper than me,\" she says. \"Do you really want to pay me 25 grand over who gets the kids on Tuesday nights?\"\n\nWasser values discretion and says she's proud the Gibsons' divorce hasn't been in the headlines even though millions are at stake, while the breakup with girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva are endless tabloid fodder.\n\n\"Their dissolution, we haven't seen anything about it,\" Wasser said, referring to her client Robyn Gibson's divorce petition.\n\nShe said the best advice she received came from a legal opponent years ago:\n\n\"He said, 'Laura, you and I are going to be working together long after your client is gone. I was young and pretty passionate.\" She said she learned to be less adversarial.\n\nWasser is also keenly aware that she was born well-connected. \"My dad has been doing this for a while,\" she said. \"Any of the kids I went to high school with, the agent across the way at CAA, they call me. There's a lot of back-scratching going on. It's total word of mouth.\"\n\nPersonal: Wasser is a single mom with two boys. She vows to never marry again.\n\nClients: Robyn Gibson, Kate Walsh, Britney Spears, Angelina Jolie, and others who will go unnamed.\n\nQuote: \"I represent celebrities, but I am not a celebrity.\""}

What is the Gargoyle King exactly?\u201d\n\nSee our interview with Aguirre-Sacasa below.\n\nTheWrap: You\u2019ve said that Season 3 won\u2019t be too heavy on the courtroom stuff with Archie. Now that he\u2019s pled guilty and he\u2019s in juvenile detention, what can you say about his fate?\n\nAguirre-Sacasa: \u201cThat\u2019s it for the trial stuff. We are definitely going to see Archie in juvenile detention. You know, we always do kind of noir and crime stuff, and we wanted to do some \u2014 there are some great, obviously, classic noirs that are set in prisons and jails, so we wanted to do sort of like almost an homage to \u201cShawshank Redemption,\u201d which is one of my favorite movies. And yeah, on the outside, we\u2019re definitely going to see everyone working to get Archie out. Especially Veronica, who doesn\u2019t want to be separated from her man.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Why Sabrina Didn't End up on 'Riverdale' -- Or on the Big Screen\n\nSpeaking of Veronica, she tells her dad in this episode, \u201cYou have no daughter.\u201d So how is that going to affect the Lodge family? Hermione especially, dealing with this crazy family life and mayoral duties.\n\n\u201cHermione\u2019s definitely caught between the two of them. And you know, Veronica and Hiram, they did fight last year, but Veronica\u2019s always been kind of a Daddy\u2019s Girl, and I think in Season 3 we really see her stop being that, and start being a real rival to her father. Last year, it was all about Hiram and Archie, and this year it\u2019s all about Veronica and Hiram.\u201d\n\nAnother character I wanted to ask you about is Betty. We find out she\u2019s been lying and hiding drugs all summer, and really avoiding the trauma from Season 2 \u2014 and then the episode ends with her having a seizure! How might this affect the rest of the season?\n\n\u201cI think you know, the good thing about this season is that after the premiere, we have a great murder mystery and a great sort of mystery and you know, shocking crime for Betty and Jughead to investigate. So Betty\u2019s very good at throwing herself into projects. So she\u2019s going to throw herself into that. And she\u2019s also going to throw herself into helping her mom, who is getting deeper and deeper into this place called the farm.\u201d\n\nYes \u2014 and in the trailer we saw the Gargoyle King right behind Betty. So is that related to the end scene when she is seizing and having this crazy vision of the babies floating?\n\n\u201cOne aspect of this season is we\u2019re going to see how all these things tie together \u2014 or if they do. And that\u2019s one of the big mysteries, is are the seizures connected to the Gargoyle King? What is the Gargoyle King exactly?\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'Riverdale' Star Lili Reinhart on Her 'Twin Peaks' Inspiration for Season 3's Flashback Episode\n\nI know you said you\u2019ve been inspired by the first season of \u201cTrue Detective.\u201d\n\n\u201cTotally.\u201d\n\nWhat I\u2019m interested in is this game that Dilton and Ben are playing. What can you tell us about this game? Will that be part of the mystery?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a really big aspect of the season. You know, when I was a kid, or when I was a teenager, Dungeons & Dragons was huge. It was kind of when it first really broke out. And a lot of adults and parents were against Dungeons & Dragons because they thought it like led to Satanism and murder and suicide and cult behavior. So Griffins & Gargoyles is sort of Riverdale\u2019s version of Dungeons & Dragons. How the game fits into all of this is also sort of part of this \u2018True Detective\u2019-like mystery.\u201d\n\nWe also in the premiere see the return of the Ghoulies when the Serpents are trying to save Hot Dog. How much will that rivalry play into the rest of the season?\n\n\u201cIt felt like last year we did a lot of stuff with the Serpents, and we did a significant amount of stuff with the Ghoulies. You know, Jughead is the Serpent King, Betty is the Serpent Queen. The Serpents are definitely in conflict with other gangs. That\u2019s a world that we\u2019re not leaving behind, but I\u2019d say that Betty and Jughead are mostly focused on the mystery at first.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'Riverdale': There's a Creepy New Mystery Promised in the New Season 3 Teaser (Video)\n\nAnd then I had a question for you just about your day-to-day. How has it been balancing \u201cRiverdale\u201d and \u201cChilling Adventures of Sabrina\u201d?\n\n\u201cBrutal! Brutal, brutal, brutal. I mean listen, you know, I\u2019m not gonna lie, it\u2019s been exhausting and challenging and I don\u2019t have weekends anymore and I don\u2019t sleep. But I love the shows, so it\u2019s easy to kind of throw myself into it. I have such great writing staffs, they make it possible. And really it\u2019s like two groups of, two teams working at the best of their, at the top of their game. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\nWe know not to expect a crossover at least anytime soon, but when working on two shows at the same time, do you find that an idea you had for \u201cRiverdale\u201d might not work there, but on \u201cSabrina\u201d instead, or vice versa?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a really good question. Yeah, you know there\u2019s always a little bit of cross-pollination that way. I will say that the shows are \u2014 because the genre is different, one is horror and one is pulpy crime, there\u2019s not tons of overlap. But I think there\u2019s no denying that they\u2019re both products of their time. And you know, that they kind of refract what I\u2019m thinking about and what the writers are thinking about. But they\u2019re pretty distinct, I would say.\u201d\n\nWe finally got to learn about the Gladys and Jellybean casting during New York Comic-Con over the weekend, which I know was exciting for fans.\n\n\u201cYeah, absolutely.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'Riverdale' Casts Anthony Michael Hall as Principal for 'Breakfast Club' Inspired Flashback Episode\n\nHave they been on set already? What can you tease about how they\u2019ll fit in?\n\n\u201cWe just shot their first episode, and they\u2019re amazing. I love them. I love them I love them I love them. They\u2019re great. You know, Gina Gershon is an icon obviously, and she\u2019s been in two of my favorite crime movies. She was in a movie called \u201cKiller Joe\u201d and she was also in one of the great modern pulp noirs, \u201cBound,\u201d which I love. And she knew Skeet [Ulrich] \u2014 it\u2019s amazing. And Trinity, who plays Jellybean, she\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nAnd how will Betty get along with Jellybean and Gladys?\n\n\u201cVery good question. Probably not well, right?\u201d\n\nDuring our interview at TCA this summer, we talked about another musical episode happening in Season 3. Have you narrowed down which musical yet?\n\n\u201cI definitely still want to do it, it\u2019s obviously one of my \u2014 it\u2019s such a fan favorite episode, and we all love it. You know, we haven\u2019t narrowed it down yet. We have a list, a running list, but it really has to be the perfect musical at the perfect time for it to work, or else it just won\u2019t be as good as last season. And kind of no one wants that, you know what I mean?\u201d\n\nYeah. So we talked about \u201cTrue Detective,\u201d you mentioned \u201cShawshank Redemption,\u201d and obviously the flashback episode is inspired by \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d \u2014 what, if any, other pop culture or pulp crime touchstones did you draw inspiration from for this season?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re definitely, you know for Veronica\u2026 she says in the [Season 2] finale, she said she\u2019s opening a speakeasy. And we\u2019re really like\u2026 there are a couple of homages to like the movie \u201cCasino,\u201d a little bit younger, the Tom Cruise movie \u201cRisky Business.\u201d We\u2019ve got some\u2026 You know the movie \u201cCabaret\u201d or the musical \u201cCabaret\u201d is obviously another inspiration. So we\u2019re going to add a little bit of showbiz glamour to Riverdale with the speakeasy.\u201d\n\n\u201cRiverdale\u201d airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. on The CW."}

Not only are Prince Harry and Meghan Markle set to tie the knot in May, but also Kate Middleton is pregnant with her third child with Prince William.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge announced that they were expecting another royal baby back in September, an addition that will expand their current brood of two to three. Middleton gave birth to her first child with William, Prince George, on July 22, 2013. Their daughter, Princess Charlotte, followed nearly two years later on May 2, 2015.\n\nTheir Royal Highnesses are choosing to not reveal the baby\u2019s gender, as they did before both Prince George and Princess Charlotte were born. However, some fans speculate that Kate Middleton and Prince William\u2019s 2017 Christmas Card\u2014which featured a photo of the family all dressed in blue\u2014was a hint that they are expecting a boy.\n\nHere\u2019s everything we know about Kate Middleton\u2019s pregnancy, due date and the new royal baby.\n\nWhen is Kate Middleton due?\n\nPrince William, Duke of Cambridge looks on as Paddington Bear kisses Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge's hand whilst they attend the Charities Forum Event at Paddington Station on October 16, 2017.

She was affected by the same condition while pregnant with both Prince George and Princess Charlotte.\n\n\u201cThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Cambridge is expecting their third child,\u201d the Palace wrote.\n\nMiddleton made her first public appearance after the third baby announcement at a Oct. 10 reception at Buckingham Palace in honor of World Mental Health Day.\n\nAbout a week later on Oct. 17, the Palace divulged that Kate Middleton is due is sometime in April 2018, just before Princess Charlotte\u2019s third birthday. This means that royal baby number three will be here before Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s wedding.\n\nWhat are the most likely royal baby names?\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge attend the BAFTAs at Royal Albert Hall on February 18, 2018. Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images:\n\nThe third royal baby\u2019s gender may still be a mystery, but London-based bookmaker William Hill is betting on another girl for Kate and William. The bookie has set royal baby names odds at 3/1 for Mary, with Alice close behind at 6/1, Victoria at 10/1 and Elizabeth at 14/1.\n\nThe name Diana has been given royal baby name odds of 20/1, indicating there is also some speculation that the Duke and Duchess will pay tribute to their child\u2019s late grandmother, Princess Diana.\n\nOn the other hand, if the royal baby turns out to be a boy, Arthur is the current favorite at 12/1, with Frederick at 14/1 and James at 16/1.\n\nHow could the royal baby make history?\n\nPrince William, Duke of Cambridge, Prince George, Princess Charlotte of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge at Germany's Hamburg airport on July 21, 2017. Karwai Tang/WireImage:\n\nThe third royal baby could make history by becoming fifth in line to the British throne regardless of its gender. Thanks to the 2013 passing of the Succession to the Crown Act to end the system of male preference primogeniture\u2014which had been in place since the Act of Settlement of 1701\u2014a boy baby would be the first prince not to take precedence over his older sister in the line of succession.\n\nThe law came into effect in 2015, meaning Princess Charlotte will remain fourth in line to the crown whether she gets a younger brother or a younger sister in April. However, Prince Harry will still move down to sixth in line after his new niece or nephew is born.\n\nWhat can we expect when the royal baby is born?\n\nCatherine, Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge leave St. Mary's hospital with Prince George, on July 23, 2013.

{"label": true, "txt": "The latest development in the push to express strength among women and solidarity in the wake of the #MeToo movement comes in the form of a classic symbol: a white rose.\n\nWhite has long been associated with the fight for women\u2019s equality, going back to the days of the suffragettes. Now attendees of the 2018 Grammy Awards are mobilizing to wear white roses to the ceremony as a way of recognizing the ongoing cultural reckoning with sexual harassment and abuse occurring across several industries, including entertainment.\n\nIndustry marketer Meg Harkins and promoter Karen Rait came up with the idea earlier this week, according to Billboard, at a dinner where they and other music industry insiders brainstormed ways to ensure that the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up movements were acknowledged at the Grammys, just like they were at the Golden Globes.\n\nAfter they had chosen the white rose \u2014 which they settled on as a symbol of peace, hope, and resistance \u2014 they began to spread the word by way of a mass email from Atlantic Records chair Julie Greenwald. Celebrities who\u2019ve confirmed they\u2019ll be wearing white roses to the Grammys include Halsey, Kelly Clarkson, Cyndi Lauper, and Rita Ora, among others on a list that reportedly numbers in the hundreds.\n\nWhen informed of the movement during an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Grammys host James Corden immediately voiced support and said he\u2019d be wearing one as well.\n\nHarkins and Rait told Billboard they were working to coordinate their messaging with the leaders of the Time\u2019s Up campaign, which has been generally viewed as a leveling-up of the #MeToo movement to call for action and change in Hollywood. Time\u2019s Up also doubles as a legal fund for anyone fighting sexual harassment.\n\nThe push to extend the conversation around the movement into the Grammys is significant; so far, despite prominent actors like Casey Affleck and James Franco coming under scrutiny in the wake of a wave of sexual assault allegations throughout Hollywood, there\u2019s been little similar pushback against prominent members of the music industry.\n\nA few, like mogul Russell Simmons, have experienced repercussions after allegations against them. But others, like musicians R. Kelly and Chris Brown, continue to maintain successful careers despite ongoing controversy surrounding accusations of sexual assault and misconduct leveled against them.\n\nThe organizers of the plan to wear white roses to the Grammys are all too aware of this dichotomy. \u201cWe have not had the tsunami [in the music industry] that politics and Hollywood has had,\u201d Harkins told the Associated Press on Wednesday, \u201cbut we are still women.\u201d\n\nThe effort to extend #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up into the music industry comes at a moment when the latter campaign is already drawing backlash for expanding its reach outside of Hollywood, even though it\u2019s not even a month old; the campaign has been criticized for not remaining narrowly focused on Hollywood reform. But the fact that in just a few days, hundreds of women in the music industry have vowed to show solidarity with Time\u2019s Up at the Grammys indicates that, if anything, an expansion of the movement\u2019s reach is still desired by many.\n\nEnsuring that the conversation remains galvanized around the Grammys, then, will be an important task for the rose wearers. Corden told the Hollywood Reporter that the topic will be a major part of the awards show \u2014 most visibly through a prominent performance by Kesha intended to spotlight the #MeToo movement.\n\nKesha has become an inadvertent leader in conversations about how to reform the music industry to keep sexual predators from being structurally protected, due to her long fight to win contractual and financial independence from her alleged rapist and former manager, the producer Dr. Luke. Her struggle speaks to the ongoing need for conversations around abuse and assault in the music industry as well as to the growing call for change.\n\n\u201cWe all agreed it was really necessary,\u201d Harkins told the AP. \u201cWe\u2019ve all felt the political and cultural change in the last couple of months.\u201d\n\nStill, the Grammys are already receiving criticism for not doing more to center the ceremony on such a glaring issue. Whether or not the red carpet is full of white roses, all eyes will be on the men and women of the music industry to see what comes next."}

But my script is so long... I'm not an actress.\"[25][26] Her performance was met with negative reviews from critics.[27] In September 2012, she and younger sister Kim created another spinoff reality television series, Kourtney and Kim Take Miami, which began airing in January 2013. It features their mother Kris Jenner and sister Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian.[28]\n\nKourtney, Khlo\u00e9, and Kim are spokeswomen for the diet supplement Quick Trim, for weight loss.[29][30] In March 2012 the three sisters were named in a $5 million class-action lawsuit against QuickTrim.[31] The complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, accused the Kardashians, along with QuickTrim's manufacturer Windmill Health Products; the retailer GNC; and others in the sales and marketing chain, of false and deceptive marketing. The plaintiffs, from several states, brought claims under their respective states' consumer protection laws.[32]\n\nKardashian also represents the skincare line PerfectSkin with her sisters, which was developed by Dr. Ron DiSalvo for Perfect Science Labs.[33] The three sisters also released a 20-piece collection of jewelry line for the company Virgins, Saints, and Angels, in March 2010. The jewelry is reflective of their partial Armenian background.[34] In 2017, Kourtney launched her first solo fashion line as part of a collaboration with the site PrettyLittleThing. According to the website, the 32-piece line was inspired by Studio 54, classical Hollywood cinema, and the 1970s.[35]\n\nPersonal life\n\nKardashian and Scott Disick in 2010\n\nKourtney began dating Scott Disick in 2006, when they met at friend Joe Francis' house party in Mexico.[36] The couple have had an on-again, off-again relationship, all throughout the filming of the show. Kourtney gave birth to their first son, Mason Dash Disick, on December 14, 2009. Mason's delivery by Beverly Hills doctor Paul Crane was filmed and aired during the 4th season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians.[37][38]\n\nIn early 2010, the couple temporarily moved to Miami with their son and Kourtney's sister Kim. During this time, Kourtney believed Disick had an alcohol problem. After regularly attending therapy and temporarily giving up alcohol, Disick and Kourtney reconciled and they continued their relationship in mid-2010.[39]\n\nIn 2011, during the final episode in the first season of Kourtney and Kim Take New York, Disick purchased an engagement ring and planned to propose to Kourtney during an evening meal in New York City. However, when Disick asked Kourtney's opinion on marriage, she responded with, \"If things are so good now...why would we want to change that?\", so he did not propose.[40] On July 8, 2012, Kourtney gave birth to their second child, daughter Penelope Scotland Disick.[41] She was named after Scotland because of Kourtney's Scottish ancestry.[42]\n\nIn June 2014, it was announced that the couple were expecting their third child together.[43] Kourtney gave birth to their third child, a son, Reign Aston Disick, on December 14, 2014, which was also Mason's fifth birthday.[44]\n\nOn July 6, 2015, E! News reported the couple's breakup.[45]\n\nFilmography\n\nAs television actress\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2011 One Life to Live Kassandra Kavanaugh TV series (1 episode)\n\nAs herself on reality TV\n\nBooks\n\nNotes\n\n^ [9] Jenner changed her name due to gender transition in 2015."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Christian Guardino wowed America\u2019s Got Talent viewers across the country with his inspiring performance, earning him the golden buzzer during Tuesday night\u2019s episode. The formerly blind singer, 17, made Simon Cowell\u2019s jaw drop just seconds into his take on The Jackson 5\u2019s \u201cWho\u2019s Lovin\u2019 You.\u201d After receiving a standing ovation from the judges and audience, Howie Mandel slammed the coveted button.\n\n\u201cI wanted to cry,\u201d Guardino tells EW, reliving the unexpected moment of glory. \u201cI was really nervous before I got on stage. I was just thinking, I can\u2019t mess up. I can\u2019t mess up. I can\u2019t mess up. But when I saw everything that was going on with the judges, all my nerves turned into strong energy and excitement. I started going off on the song and getting comfortable.\u201d\n\nMaking Guardino\u2019s AGT experience even more special: He was able to watch all the action go down. \u201cI would have never been able to see it before,\u201d says Guardino, who was totally blind before a revolutionary treatment helped him regain most of his sight when he was 12.\n\nStruggling with his vision impairment as a child, Guardino turned to melody. \u201cMusic was always my escape,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I was dealing with my condition, it was a way to forget everything that was happening.\u201d\n\nHis disability would end up amplifying his musical talent, too. \u201cMy hearing was strengthened because of my eyesight,\u201d he says. \u201cI hear music in a strong way. It\u2019s always been there for me.\u201d\n\nVIDEO: Here\u2019s How To Save on Concert Tickets So You Still Have Money For Merch\n\nHaving grown up in a musical family, Guardino already has an impressive musical background: In middle school, he performed in a circuit of talent shows on Long Island and sang multiple times at the Apollo Theater. He also performed a duet with Jordin Sparks in November at an event for Michelle Obama\u2019s Partnership for a Healthy America in Washington D.C.\n\nNow he wants to take on songwriting, looking to his idol Stevie Wonder for inspiration. \u201cI feel like I relate to him and what he goes through being blind and struggling with his sight,\u201d he says. \u201cI love his voice. It\u2019s incredible.\u201d\n\nHe also looks up to Cowell. While Mandel was the judge to press the golden buzzer for Guardino, immediately securing him a spot in the quarterfinals, Guardino says it was Cowell he was trying to impress. \u201cI know Simon\u2019s so honest and he\u2019s going to tell me how it was, and if I wasn\u2019t good he would tell me,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut I\u2019m really glad he liked me!\u201d\n\nCowell\u2019s October announcement that he would return to the show motivated Guardino to audition. \u201cI\u2019m a huge fan of America\u2019s Got Talent and ever since Simon came on it was like, No way. It felt like I had to do this,\u201d remembers Guardino, who went to the pre-round auditions after learning they were being held in New York City\u2019s Queens borough in January. \u201cIt\u2019s been my dream to go in front of him.\u201d\n\nAfter his successful Los Angeles audition, Guardino spotted Cowell outside the theater and walked up to him. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be really good friends,\u201d Guardino recalls hearing from Cowell, who hugged him and praised his vocal performance.\n\nThe compliments have poured in, with host Tyra Banks tweeting, \u201cYou just BLEW ME AWAY!\u201d on Tuesday, and Howie Mandel singing his praises in a YouTube video. As Mandel pointed out, the last person to receive a Golden Buzzer from him was last year\u2019s pre-teen contestant Grace VanderWaal, whom Guardino says he\u2019d like to ask for performance tips as he preps for his next appearance on the show in early August. Right now, though, he\u2019s not looking at it as a competition \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ll get way too nervous if I think of it that way,\u201d he says \u2014 but rather just another great opportunity to perform."}

These can be almost unlimited in length (for example, aminoheptafluorocyclotetraphosphonitrile, (40 letters) and many contain numerals, Roman and Greek letters, and other symbols, as well as ordinary letters.

Nikki and Brie are presenting and are nominated for an award. Nikki Bella is asked on the red carpet about returning to the WWE. She says that she was disappointed that she wasn't drafted to Smackdown Live and is unsure of what her future will be.\n\nWe are now in Sofia, Bulgaria. Rusev's mom Slavka is awaiting her son and Lana's arrival at the airport. When they do arrive, Lana off screen talks about their upcoming wedding, which is their second. The first one took place in Malibu and this one will be more in line with Rusev's wishes of having a traditional Bulgarian wedding. Later on, Rusev and Lana are on the road together. They start arguing over who will play the role of maid of honor. To which Rusev states, that there will be no such thing at this wedding. This doesn't go over well with Lana.\n\nBack in the states at Eva Marie's parents home in Concord, California. Eva is with her parents Josie and Barry. Eva's father has recently had knee replacement surgery. He and Eva get into a bit of argument because she didn't bring over the food, that he wanted. Eva tells her dad that he shouldn't be eating McDonalds. She is worried about her father's health and she wants to see him retire. Barry is not keen on the idea of retiring because he feels like he is being put out to pasture.\n\nBack in Bulgaria, Lana and Rusev have arrived at their hotel and meet up with friends and family. Once Lana and Rusev get settled into their honeymoon suite. Lana once again attempts to get Rusev to allow her to have a maid of honor at their wedding. Lana suggests her sister assume the same role, she had at the first wedding. Rusev gets annoyed with Lana pushing for this again. He tells her that they can't mess with Bulgarian traditions, that go back thousands of years. Rusev's best friend and wife are slated to be the best man and woman at their upcoming wedding. Rusev has also pegged them as being future god parents.... Off screen, Lana makes mention of a black eye that Rusev is sporting, as a result of a recent match. Lana is angry with Rusev's stubbornness and suggests giving him another black eye. Back in the hotel room, The couple are still arguing. Lana complains about Rusev's family traditions. Rusev ends the argument by telling Lana, that she should have married a Greek guy instead, if she wanted to be able to make changes.\n\nBack in Los Angeles, The Bellas are doing a photo shoot at Global Fitness. When the shoot is done, Nikki Bella gets a message and an offer to be on 'Dancing With The Stars'. Nikki tells Brie about it and is very excited about the possibility. Nikki asks Brie what night the show is on the air, and wonders if she can do both the WWE and Dancing at the same time. When Nikki finds out that the show is on opposite of Raw on Mondays. She says that she will be going to Smackdown Live instead. Nikki suggests promoting her neck injury and return on both platforms. Brie discourages Nikki by questioning her dancing skills. Nikki tries to demonstrate her abilities to Brie.\n\nBack at Eva Marie's parents house, The family is getting together for dinner. Eva is concerned about her father's health and eating habits. Barry has colon cancer and it hasn't gone away. After the dinner, Eva and her husband Jonathan have a chat in the kitchen. Eva tells him about the concerns for her father. She then decides to take action. She throws out all the leftovers and tells her family, that she is going to start taking control of her father's diet.\n\nMeanwhile in Bulgaria. Lana gets christened in an Orthodox church. She goes through the rituals while Rusev's family aids and looks on. Lana is prayed to, told to spit on the ground and then step on it. Afterwards, She takes off her shoes and places her bare feet in water, and leans over while the priest christens her with water repeatedly. Lana off screen, talks of how upset she is, that Rusev didn't tell her, about what she would had to do. Lana is fuming in the church while Rusev is instructing her on proper hand placement..... Moments later, Lana is asked to have a part of her hair cut and she refuses. Lana looks over her shoulder and tells Rusev, that she should have been told about this beforehand. Rusev is furious and gives Lana back a cold stare. The priest and others try to get Lana to go through with the tradition. Lana spouts back that she wasn't told about these traditions in advance. Rusev looks away in disbelief. After some convincing by her mom Judy, Lana relents and has a small part of her hair cut. Off screen, Lana says that she is so livid with Rusev right now.\n\nThe Bella family is together having lunch in Arizona. Nikki tells her brother and sister in-law about her Dancing With The Stars opportunity. Nikki says that she won't be able to do both the WWE and the dancing show. That she might have to pick one over the other. Nikki admits that she has enjoyed her time away from being on the road and wrestling. She talks about not being cleared yet to return to the WWE, and how she doesn't feel wanted right now by the company. Nikki's brother suggests that she does Dancing With The Stars. He feels that it will open up more opportunities for her outside of wrestling.\n\nBack in Bulgaria. The drama continues for Rusev and Lana. After the christening ceremony, Lana vents to her parents outside of the church. Rusev comes out to address his wife, and Lana airs out her grievances with him. Rusev doesn't understand what the big deal is and why Lana threw a tantrum and disrespected the church. A few expletives are exchanged, while a camera hidden behind a tree, picks up the conversation. Lana tells him that she is upset and leaving. Rusev figures that they are heading back together to the hotel but Lana tells him that she is leaving on her own. Rusev calmly responds \"To America?\". Rusev says that if that's what she wants, Lana can do it.... Moments later, Lana is shown crying somewhere on the grounds outside of the church. Her mom Judy tries to calm her down. When Rusev interrupts the conversation and tells Lana, that she now has to be dipped into the river. Lana pouts like a child and says that she doesn't want to do it. Rusev laughs because he was just joking. Despite Rusev trying to bring some levity to the situation, Lana is still upset.\n\nMeanwhile in Concord, California. Eva Marie and Jonathan have gone grocery shopping for her dad. Eva tries to institute a raw food diet to help with Barry's cancer. Eva and her husband are preparing a health shake for Barry's breakfast. He's not going for it and wants bacon and eggs. The green smoothies with veggies don't go over well with Barry. Eva Marie's brother Neal shows up and he gives his two cents on Eva's forced diet on their dad. Neal is not against his dad eating healthier but doesn't like the extreme transition set up by his sister..... Later on, Eva Marie starts snooping around the house looking to see if her father is still smoking. She searches the house with Jonathan. Eva says that her dad has been known to sneak around and smoke cigarettes on the property. Eva is upset when she does find a cigarette butt in the backyard. She is upset after 3 heart attacks and a 15 year battle with cancer, that her father is still smoking. Later on, Eva has a long time chat with her husband about the approach to take with her dad. Jonathan suggests that Eva take it easy with him because he has been set in his ways for so long.\n\nJimmy Uso, Trinity(Naomi) and Natalya have arrived for Lana and Rusev's second wedding in Bulgaria. They can't believe that they have committed to this. They have taken 3 flights that combined for nearly 20 hours. Natalya and Naomi have the impression that they will both be brides maids for this wedding. On the cab ride from the airport to the hotel. The Bulgarian cab driver tries to speak to Jimmy Uso in his native language..... After Nattie has arrived at the hotel. Lana comes by to see her. She tells Natalya about her traumatizing day at the christening. Natalya sympathizes with Lana's plight and jokes that Lana's mom may make her want to grow a beard.\n\nWe are now at John Cena and Nikki Bella's home in Tampa, Florida. John says \"Nikki, I Love You\" and gives her a diamond... dallas page yoga dvd set!.... Just kidding.... Nikki tells John about her opportunity on Dancing With The Stars. He congratulates her but is surprised and wants to know what it means for Nikki's future. Nikki tells him about potentially doing the WWE and the stars show on ABC at the same time. John cites himself as an example and provides an interesting take on handling both. How he has been doing the WWE and a fox reality tv series at the same time. How it has been risky for him because if he were to be injured on one show, than it would effect him being able to perform on both shows. Cena suggests that Nikki doing WWE and dancing with the stars would be too physically demanding for Nikki to do. He asks her what is most important to her and says that Nikki can't do both, that she has to choose one.\n\nLana and Rusev are with friends and family having dinner at a restaurant in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. Natalya toasts to \"the weird and wacky world of Bulgaria\". Rusev questions Nattie's choice of words and then suggests that everyone have some \"Rakia\". He promises that the alcohol is not too strong. Jimmy Uso, Natalya and Naomi all have comical reactions after taking a sip. Jimmy is hyped for it but appears to have burned a hole in his throat after drinking some of that \"Rakia\". Rusev then toasts to everyone and tells the women that he has prepared for them to wear traditional Bulgarian attire. The women have to take notes and prepare because they will be dancing in the streets during the wedding. Lana and company all leave and get changed. They return in the attire and dance with Bulgarian men. Trinity and Lana seem game but Natalya is uncomfortable. Jimmy Uso gets a kick out of it and likes his wife's attire.\n\nTrinity and Rusev def do NOT have the same taste in alcohol. #TotalDivas pic.twitter.com/niceo4dLJM \u2014 Total Divas (@TotalDivas) April 27, 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nFYI: At Bulgarian weddings, dancing is mandatory.

Eva Marie has an emotional conversation with her father. They discuss their time apart from one another, Barry's health and potential retirement. Eva is told by her father that he is not ready to retire yet despite working for 55 years straight. Barry appreciates Eva's love and care for him and promises to let her know when he officially decides to retire.\n\nBack at the dinner in Bulgaria. Lana and Rusev walk off to have a discussion about their recent differences. Lana is still hurt by the fact that Rusev is not respecting her feelings. He doesn't understand why Lana is upset to begin with. He then goes over another bone of contention between them, which is the Bulgarian tradition of who the best man and woman can be in a wedding ceremony, that the best man has to be married and his marital advice must take precedence during any issues. Lana is not down with this at all. Her and Rusev continue to argue and not see eye to eye. Lana walks off, worse off than she was before the conversation even started. When Lana returns to the dinner table. Naomi sees that Lana is upset and asks her about it. Lana starts ranting about how Rusev will never admit to being wrong. Lana ends the rant by saying, \"I don't want his stupid traditions\".\n\nThe very next day, Lana is greeted by Natalya in her hotel room. Lana is in her wedding dress. They have a talk about Lana's recent issues with Rusev. Natalya tries to calm Lana's anxiety by suggesting that she surrender and let go of her feelings. Nattie then takes Lana out to the balcony and gets her to scream \"I surrender\".\n\nNikki Bella meets up with her sister Brie in Phoenix. They discuss Nikki's current situation and future. Nikki then gets in contact with her agent about the Dancing With The Stars opportunity. Nikki tells her agent that she is going to pass on the offer. Nikki says that she wants her comeback to be with the WWE and nowhere else. Her agent \"Blake\" tries to convince her that she needs to think about the future, and asks Nikki if she is sure about this. Nikki reassures him that she is.\n\nLana and Rusev's Bulgarian wedding has begun. Lana is given instructions on all the specific traditions. Part of it entails Lana hiding her shoe and Rusev arriving to buy the bride from the other women. Natalya and Lana's sister are chosen to negotiate the price, at the door when Rusev arrives to claim his wife. A nice touch as Rusev's ring entrance plays when he arrives outside. He has a bottle of liquor with him and heads to Lana's room with several friends and family members in tow. Rusev knocks on the door and says that he wants his wife. The women chant in Bulgarian on the other side of the door. Natalya then negotiates a price with Rusev. The door is then opened slightly for him to start giving money through. Rusev hands over some bills and the women chant \"more money\" at him until he gives them the right amount. When Rusev finally meets the asking price, the door is open and Rusev and an entire Bulgarian band follows. Rusev then searches for and finds Lana's hidden shoe. Before they head out for the remaining festivities. Lana takes Rusev aside and apologizes to him for her behavior. After the chat, They head to street and celebrate in the streets. The wedding ceremony follows and can be seen in the video below. Rusev and Lana exchange vows, They both have crowns put on their heads and they hold candles. After the ceremony, Lana and Rusev throw white doves into the air. The after party occurs and Lana states that she is so happy with the way things turned out. The show ends on this note.\n\nNext week on Total Divas. Maryse and Miz try to jazz up their relationship. Natalya's cat actually gets an agent and Nikki Bella's in ring training for her return continues."}

{"label": true, "txt": "NEW YORK \u2014 With 27 more women accusing former news anchor Charlie Rose of sexual misconduct, a report Thursday calls into question CBS News\u2019 claims that his behavior was a surprise before he was fired last November.\n\nThe Washington Post said that on least three occasions prior to that, women reported discomfort about Rose\u2019s actions to superiors. Rose was fired as \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d anchor and PBS cancelled his interview show after an earlier Post report on women who said he groped them, made lewd remarks or walked around naked around them.\n\nIn one new allegation, a former research assistant said Rose exposed his penis and touched her breasts when they worked at NBC News\u2019 Washington bureau in 1976.\n\nThe Post said Rose, 76, told the newspaper in an email that its story was inaccurate and unfair.\n\nSince Rose was fired, CBS News said it has taken steps to ensure a safer workplace, including mandatory misconduct training. Network news President David Rhodes and other key managers have said they were unaware of Rose\u2019s actions. Yet the Post outlined three episodes where word had reportedly spread:\n\nAnnmarie Parr was a 22-year-old news clerk in 1986 when she handed Rose a script and he asked whether she enjoyed sex and how often she liked to have it. She told a senior producer about it and said she didn\u2019t want to be alone with Rose, and said her boss laughed and said, \u201cFine, you don\u2019t have to be alone with him anymore.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, a woman who worked at \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d said Rose forcibly kissed her at a holiday party. She complained to the show\u2019s top producer, Chris Licht, but asked him not to tell human resources about it. Licht told the newspaper he followed her wishes and also talked to Rose about the incident.\n\nA 24-year-old woman who worked the night shift was noticed by Rose last year. He began taking her to expensive restaurants and talked about other jobs. The executive assistant to the show\u2019s new producer, Ryan Kadro, said she told her boss about the attention Rose was paying to the young woman, and said he did not seem alarmed. Kadro disputed that she told him about inappropriate behavior.\n\nSome of the women told the Post they feared reporting bad behavior to their bosses because the network was more concerned about the male TV personalities. \u201cI had been there long enough to know that it was just the way things went,\u201d said Sophie Gayter, 27, who said Rose groped her while they walked down a hall. \u201cPeople said what they wanted to you. People did what they wanted to you.\u201d\n\nEleanor McManus, co-founder of Press Forward, a group of women who have been victims of sexual misconduct in newsrooms, said the Post report illustrated a systematic problem across news organizations that needed to be addressed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear that there were people in management who were aware that there was a problem, and nothing was done,\u201d McManus told The Associated Press on Thursday. With the stories that have come out about the likes of Rose, Matt Lauer and Mark Halperin, the networks are making strides but women need to know they can report wrongdoings without repercussions, she said.\n\nMarcy McGinnis, who was senior vice president of newsgathering at CBS News when she left in 2005, said she didn\u2019t know Rose but knew he had a reputation as a \u201cladies man.\u201d His behavior never came up at senior staff meetings, she said, and she was surprised as others when she read about Rose\u2019s behavior.\n\n\u201cThis just proves how important it is for people in positions of authority to believe people when they come forward with complaints, instead of brushing them off (by saying) \u2018boys will be boys\u2019 or \u2018that\u2019s just Charlie,'\u201d McGinnis said.\n\nCBS News said it could not confirm or corroborate many of the stories told by The Post.\n\n\u201cWe continue to look for ways to improve our workplace and this period of reflection and action has been important to all of us,\u201d the network said.\n\nThe network recently appointed a working group led by Karen Raffensberger, CBS standards director, to look at the structure of how CBS handles complaints of inappropriate behavior.\n\nFor many years, Rose did his PBS interview show at the same time he worked for CBS, and the Post story also examined his behavior there. In 2003, a then-20-year-old intern was brought by Rose on a trip to California, where she alleged that he squeezed her breast while on a car ride. The woman said she complained to PBS management and was told that Rose was harmless.\n\nPoll: A third of women say they\u2019ve been sexually harassed or abused at work"}

{"label": true, "txt": "While the entire world will have eyes set on Meghan Markle and Prince Harry on Saturday, desis back home will be rooting for someone else at the royal wedding. Bollywood star Priyanka Chopra is in London and is ready to watch her friend walk down the aisle.\n\nThe actor reached London ahead of the royal wedding wearing a plaid pantsuit. Priyanka had earlier confessed that she was \u201cstressed out about [wearing] a small hat\u201d but a visit to iconic British fascinator designer Philip Treacy put her mind to rest. Ohhhh, now I get it !!\u201d the 35-year-old actor shared a photo as she is surrounded by fascinator designs. Her makeup artist Patrick Ta also reached London and shared an Instagram photo, giving us a broad hint that he will be creating Priyanka\u2019s makeup look for Meghan Markle\u2019s wedding.\n\nWelcomed by the UK sun... #nomakeupnofilter A post shared by Priyanka Chopra (@priyankachopra) on May 18, 2018 at 11:58am PDT\n\nPriyanka will be one of the very few Indian faces present at the wedding and those who don\u2019t know about her friendship with the to-be princess might be wondering about the connection. To clear all doubt, here\u2019s a quick revision for you on how they met, what they have said about each other and more.\n\nThe Bollywood star and the American actor first met in January 2016 at Elle\u2019s 6th Annual Women in TV Celebration. They met at the party which was also attended by Viola Davis, Olivia Wilde and more. The two hit it off instantly. \u201cWe bonded as actors. We just became friends, like two girls would,\u201d Priyanka told People magazine in 2017.\n\nMeghan then interviewed Priyanka for her now-defunct lifestyle blog, The Tig. Soon, they became good friends and started hanging out regularly. They watched Hamilton together, enjoyed drinks by swimming pools in Malibu and clicked a lot of selfies. While a few pictures from this phase can still be found online on Priyanka\u2019s Instagram, others were lost when Meghan\u2019s Instagram profile was deactivated after she got engaged to Prince Harry in November 2017.\n\nBefore the engagement was announced and when Harry and Meghan were being spotted together by the paparazzi, even Priyanka started getting bombarded by curious questions about her friend and her prince. In May 2017, she was asked by Wendy Williams on her show about \u2018Prince Harry\u2019s girlfriend,\u2019 Priyanka didn\u2019t hesitate in correcting her: \u201cAlso, Meghan Markle: actress, Suits, her achievements,\u201d a gesture appreciated by both the actors\u2019 fans.\n\nThe love, however, has not been one-sided. Meghan also talked about Priyanka with PTI in an interview. \u201cI would love to work with her on a film one day! I told her specifically that my dream is to work with her on a Bollywood film, because I think it would be so much fun \u2014 she said I should do it,\u201d she had said.\n\nPriyanka also recently wrote a piece on Meghan for Time magazine as she featured in their list of 100 Most Influential and called her a \u2018princess for the people.\u2019 Here\u2019s the full text:\n\nSomewhere among biryani, poutine and endless conversations, I realized just how deeply Meghan Markle cares for the world. With her, what you see is real, and what you get is a relatable young woman with her heart and mind in the right place. Her compassion, evident in the causes she supports, and her drive to break down stereotypes\u2014obvious in her actions\u2014will connect her to a generation in much need of kindness.\n\nThis ever-smiling, strong free spirit found her prince, fell in love and in turn made a cynical world believe in fairy tales again. But more than anything else, Meghan is an important influencer in a world that needs strong public figures to respect and look up to. People the world can be inspired by. Meghan, standing shoulder to shoulder with Harry, will be a princess for the people.\n\nLove always, my friend. Live happily ever after.\n\nPriyanka was again asked about Meghan on The View, Good Morning America and What Happens Live With Andy Cohen earlier this month as she promoted her show, Quantico. She was asked about what she would wear, the gift she had chosen, if she had met Prince Harry or if she knows with Meghan cried when she saw her wedding dress. Priyanka, like a true friend gave nothing away.\n\nGuess, we will have to wait just a few more hours to find that out with the world.\n\nFirst Published: May 19, 2018 10:28 IST"}

There was nowhere to hide.\n\n20+ people were studying my face on the camera monitor at any given time during the 11 hour shoot. And all I could think about when I was in the front of the camera were the pimples on my forehead.\n\nI always text my mom when I have a bad breakout. I tell her how ugly I feel and how these breakouts shatter my confidence every time they appear.\n\nBut I'm hoping that someday I can feel beautiful even if I'm having a breakout. And that I won't feel obsessive or paranoid.\n\nI feel the need to talk about my struggles with acne.

He is known for his performances in many films, in which he frequently portrays both the hopeless romantic or a sleazy, but oh-so-attractive jerk. Grant graduated from New College in Oxford where he studied English literature, and acted purely for pleasure. He never thought of having a career in the entertainment industry. However, Grant soon performed in a touring production of \"Twelfth Night,\" and started participating in the Oxford University Dramatic Society.\n\nBefore becoming famous, Grant tried his hand at a variety of different jobs, such as writing book reviews, writing radio commercials, and tutoring. Eventually, Grant returned to acting, performing in many plays in England. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Grant was offered roles in smaller films, such as \"Bitter Moon\", directed by Roman Polanski, and intellectual films, such as \"The Remains of the Day\". His big breakout role that made him a huge star came in \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" . It was the highest-grossing British film at the time, and Grant was awarded a Golden Globe. Grant went on to make films such as \"Mickey Blue Eyes\", \"Bridget Jones' Diary\", \"Love Actually\", \"Notting Hill\" and many more. Critics often praise Grant's performances, however, he is sometimes considered to have no versatility in his career, and constantly turns to the same jokes. Hugh has been linked to a number of beautiful women during his life, most notably Liz Hurley. Grant and Hurley spent 13 years together before separating in 2000. Hugh has a daughter and a son with a woman named Tinglan Hong who was working as a receptionist at a Chinese restuarant in London when they met. Hugh has a third child with a Swedish TV producer."}
{"label": true, "txt": "EXCLUSIVE UPDATED: Two popular, long-time Grey\u2019s Anatomy cast members, Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew, will be departing the hit ABC medical drama at the end of the current fourteenth season. Capshaw has been on the show for 10 seasons, nine of them as a series regular, playing Dr. Arizona Robbins; Drew has been on Grey\u2019s for nine seasons, eight of them as a series regular, playing Dr. April Kepner.\n\nThe decision was made by the producers who at the start of each season have to formally pick up the option of each regular cast member. Sources say Capshaw and Drew will be the only series regular members of Grey\u2019s large ensemble cast to depart this year.\n\nABC\n\nWhile Grey\u2019s, created/executive produced by Shonda Rhimes and executive produced by co-showrunner Krista Vernoff, has not been officially renewed for Season 15, that is considered a foregone conclusion with its ratings remaining strong and its star, Ellen Pompeo, signing a new two-year deal. The decision not to bring back Capshaw and Drew comes on the heels of the blockbuster new Pompeo pact that gave her a significant salary increase, paying her as much as $20 million a year.\n\nSources close to the matter stress that the decision for Capshaw and Drew\u2019s exits was based strictly on the show\u2019s creative direction, something Vernoff alluded to in her statement.\n\n\u201cThe characters of Arizona and April are permanently woven into the fabric of Grey\u2019s Anatomy thanks to the extraordinary work of Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew,\u201d Vernoff said. \u201cAs writers, our job is to follow the stories where they want to go and sometimes that means saying goodbye to characters we love. It has been a joy and a privilege to work with these phenomenally talented actresses.\u201d\n\nRhimes underlined the cultural significance of Capshaw and Drew\u2019s characters \u2014 Arizona, who is a lesbian, and April, who has a very close relationship with God \u2014 and indicated that we may see them again.\n\nABC\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always hard for me to say goodbye to any of my characters,\u201d Rhimes said. \u201cBoth Arizona Robbins and April Kepner are not only beloved but iconic \u2014 both the LBGTQ and devout Christian communities are underrepresented on TV. I will be forever grateful to both Jessica and Sarah for bringing these characters to life with such vibrant performance and for inspiring women around the globe. They will always be a part of our Shondaland family.\u201d\n\nUPDATE: While Deadline\u2019s story stressed that the decision for Capshaw and Drew\u2019s exits was strictly creative, the mention of the big new deal for Pompeo, which helped secure a renewal for Grey\u2019s, led to online speculation about a possible connection between the two.\n\nThere is no such connection that we are aware of. Because this has become an issue, pitting women against each other on International Women\u2019s Day, we are making it clear. Here is Vernoff\u2019s statement on the fallout:\n\nLike most Grey\u2019s non-original cast members, Capshaw and Drew started on the show as recurring \u2014 Capshaw in Season 5, Drew in Season 6 \u2014 before getting promoted to series regulars the following season.\n\nDrew\u2019s Dr. April Kepner is an attending trauma surgeon at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital who joined from Mercy West Medical Center after the merger. She shares a daughter with her ex, Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams).\n\nCapshaw\u2019s Dr. Arizona Robbins is Head of Fetal Surgery, an Attending Pediatric Surgeon and a board member at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. She was married to Callie Torres, who was played by Sara Ramirez until she left Grey\u2019s at the end of Season 12 after 10 years on the show.\n\nBoth characters are fan favorites, with each of the actresses boasting 1.9 million followers on Instagram. Drew often posts behind the scenes photos from Grey\u2019s, including this shot of her and Capshaw a couple of weeks ago.\n\nToday, following the news of their pending exits, both shared their reactions with fans. \u201cI know you\u2019re sad. I\u2019m sad, too, Drew wrote. \u201cFor now, I\u2019d like to say: I love you April and her story isn\u2019t over yet.\u201d\n\nWrote Capshaw, \u201cFor the past ten years I have had the rare privilege of not only playing Arizona Robbins, but also being madly in love with playing her. She was one of the first members of the LGBTQ community to be represented in a series regular role on network television. Her impact on the world is forever. \u201d"}
{"label": true, "txt": "We're still processing the season two finale of Stranger Things . Sure, things ended on\u2014spoiler warning\u2014a positive note at the Snow Ball , but we have a feeling the crew isn't finished with the mysteries of the Upside Down just yet. (Um, remember that haunting last shot of the Mind Flayer?) And then there are the blossoming romances: Eleven and Mike! Max and Lucas! Puppy love has honestly never looked cuter. There's also Nancy's love triangle with Jonathan and Steve to think about, not to mention the adorable, and unexpected, friendship between Dustin and Steve. Plus, what the hell is going to happen between Joyce and Sheriff Hopper? It's only a matter of time before they get together, right?\n\nLike we said, there's a lot to think about\u2014and it looks like our questions will be answered sooner rather than later. Netflix confirmed in December 2017 that a third season of Stranger Things is officially happening. The streaming platform posted a poll on its Twitter page asking if another season of the show should happen, and shortly after we received an answer: \"FOR THE LOVE OF STEVE, DUH! So hold tight baby darts\u2014season three is officially happening.\" See the tweet for yourself, below:\n\nExcited? So are we. Granted, season three is in development, but here's what we know so far (some spoilers from seasons one and two ahead):\n\n1. Writers are still bouncing around ideas. At the time of the second-season premiere in late October, cocreator Matt Duffer revealed the third season had been in the writers' room for only about two days. In other words, even the showrunners don't know much about the plot right now.\n\n2. Season three will start off with a \"clean slate.\" That's what the Duffer brothers told The Hollywood Reporter. And this makes sense: Remember, the Upside Down has been closed, so that danger isn't looming over them anymore. Of course, there's the issue of that pesky Mind Flayer hovering over the school, which is certainly going to cause some trouble. \"[The Mind Flayer is still out there],\" Ross Duffer also told THR. \"They've shut the door on the Mind Flayer, but not only is it still there in the Upside Down, it's very much aware of the kids, and particularly Eleven.\"\n\n3. There are more like Eleven and Eight. We were introduced to Kali, another child experimented on at the Hawkins Lab, this season on Stranger Things. Her nickname is Eight, like Jane's is Eleven, and the Duffer brothers told E! there are more siblings out there who we don't know about. \"I think we've clearly implied there are other numbers, and I can't imagine that the world will only ever know Eleven and Eight,\" Matt Duffer said.\n\n4. There's no more Hawkins Lab. It's closed up shop for good, according to this article from Collider.\n\n5. Expect to see more of Erica, Lucas' iconic little sister. \"We were able to integrate more of her in [season two], but not as much you want because the story [was] already going. \u2018We got to use more Erica\u2019\u2014that was one of the first things we said in the writers room [for three],\u201d Ross told Yahoo .\n\n6. Max and Eleven won't be enemies. Why the showrunners decided to make these two young girls hate each other in season two is a mystery. However, Ross contends they won't be adversaries for long. \"They won\u2019t be enemies,\" he told HelloGiggles . \"They won\u2019t be enemies forever. We\u2019re excited [to] spend more time with Max and develop her in a way\u2026we\u2019re sort of scratching the surface on this season of what I think she\u2019s capable of.\u201d\n\n7. There will be another time jump. The Duffer brothers confirmed this to THR as well, but how many years or months exactly is still unknown. Our money's on exactly one year, just like season two.\n\n8. You'll see a new side of Karen Wheeler. One of the funniest scenes of season two involved a flirtatious moment between Mike and Nancy's mom and bad boy Billy.

{"label": true, "txt": "For one sunny summer weekend, at least, there was peace in the mad, mad world of Mel Gibson. He spent July 10 and 11 playing and enjoying time with his 9-month-old daughter Lucia in his Malibu home. \u201cHe\u2019s okay as long as he\u2019s with her,\u201d says a friend. \u201cHe loves that baby.\u201d Meanwhile his ex-girlfriend and Lucia\u2019s mom, Oksana Grigorieva, 40-his adversary in a ferocious ongoing custody battle-was photographed 15 miles away, grocery shopping.\n\nBut as soon as the weekend was over, one of Hollywood\u2019s nastiest breakups went ballistic again. On July 12 an eight-minute recording allegedly of Gibson viciously ranting at Grigorieva was posted on Radaronline.com, which has posted several leaked tapes despite a judge\u2019s ordering them sealed. Hyperventilating with fury during the phone conversation early this year, Gibson, 54, screams and curses while seemingly admitting to having hit Grigorieva in the face while she held Lucia and threatening to bury Grigorieva \u201cin an [expletive] rose garden \u2026 I\u2019m capable of it\u201d (see box). Gibson\u2019s raw, hate-filled outbursts-other tapes, reportedly made by Grigorieva, included racial and ethnic slurs-have people wondering how the life of a movie star once renowned for his charm and humility could have gone so far off the rails.\n\nGibson may have to answer that in court: The L.A. County Sheriff\u2019s Department announced it is investigating Grigorieva\u2019s claims that he hit her in the face \u201cmore than once\u201d this January, knocking out a dental veneer. (A Gibson source said the actor was restraining Grigorieva from shaking Lucia \u201clike a rag doll\u201d; Gibson also claims to have evidence Grigorieva was using tapes to try to extort money from him.) L.A. criminal defense attorney Trent Copeland calls the tapes \u201ca smoking gun of domestic violence\u201d that will create public pressure to charge Gibson, perhaps with battery and making threats. But \u201cas inflammatory as this tape is, it\u2019s not a slam dunk against Mel,\u201d says former L.A. prosecutor Jeffery Rubenstein. \u201cThe legality of the tapes will be fought over, and it could be argued that she deliberately pushed his buttons.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime Gibson\u2019s vitriolic rants, on top of anti-Semitic remarks he made during his 2006 arrest for drunk driving, have turned some of Hollywood against him. His agency William Morris Endeavor announced on July 9 that it would no longer represent him, a few days after the death of his longtime personal agent Ed Limato. Ari Emanuel, the head of WME, \u201cpersonally hated the things Mel has said and done,\u201d says an industry source. \u201cHe was embarrassed to have him at William Morris.\u201d And while Gibson has often financed his films himself, his future as a bankable mainstream actor is in doubt. His Jodie Foster-directed dark comedy The Beaver, shot last fall, still has no release date, while a proposed Viking epic with Leonardo DiCaprio \u201cwill never happen [with Leo],\u201d says a source. \u201cAt a certain point, it\u2019s five strikes and you\u2019re out,\u201d says one Hollywood insider. \u201cHe has expressed hate towards so many kinds of people, I think he\u2019s toast.\u201d\n\nSome who know Gibson say he began losing control of his life after separating from his wife of 26 years, Robyn, in 2006 and particularly after she filed for divorce in April 2009. \u201cRobyn always had a calming influence on Mel, and he always felt safe with her,\u201d says a source close to the family. \u201cHis family always stood by him through good and bad. Now Mel is like a lost boy without her.\u201d\n\nGibson seemed to rebound after his 2006 DUI arrest, apologizing for drunkenly telling cops that Jews were responsible \u201cfor all the wars in the world.\u201d He also landed the lead role in the thriller Edge of Darkness. But then he started publicly stepping out with Grigorieva, a Russian-born musician (Lucia was born last October; they broke up this March). From the beginning, say friends, they were not an ideal match. \u201cShe has no sense of humor,\u201d an acquaintance says of Grigorieva. \u201cI thought, \u2018God, Mel loves to joke, so what\u2019s he going to do with this girl?\u2019 You had an impulsive, damaged, funny man with an opportunistic, cold survivor. It was destined for doom.\u201d Sources close to Gibson\u2019s camp believe Grigorieva only dated him to benefit her career and bank account: \u201cMel realized how unhealthy the relationship was and recognized he was getting his buttons pushed. He wanted to figure out how to extricate himself peacefully and calmly,\u201d says one friend. Gibson began seeing a therapist earlier this year to help him deal with the troubled relationship, says the source, noting the actor is still in therapy.\n\nGibson has long admitted to problems controlling his emotions. In a 2002 interview he said he had been diagnosed as manic depressive; he entered rehab for alcoholism after his 2006 DUI arrest. Lately he seemed to have been staying sober. On the set of Edge of Darkness, Gibson \u201cdid not drink, and he wasn\u2019t going crazy,\u201d says production assistant Jill Habelow. A source on the set of Gibson\u2019s movie How I Spent My Summer Vacation, filmed in Mexico this spring, says Gibson \u201cwas not raging around. He was just one of the guys, and [crew members] would run through a wall for him.\u201d\n\nBut the way Gibson\u2019s anger has erupted is new and alarming, says the Gibson family source. \u201cMel never talked to Robyn in a disrespectful way,\u201d says the source. \u201cHe\u2019s had anger issues all his life, but Robyn knew how to deal with him. To hear how Mel speaks to Oksana in such a hateful manner is very sad. It shows how far off the track Mel has gone.\u201d"}

{"label": true, "txt": "This article is about the attorney. For his son, the television personality, see Rob Kardashian\n\nRobert George Kardashian (February 22, 1944 \u2013 September 30, 2003) was an American attorney and businessman. He gained national recognition as O. J. Simpson's friend and defense attorney during Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He had four children with his first wife, Kris Kardashian (n\u00e9e Houghton, later Jenner): Kourtney, Kim, Khlo\u00e9, and Rob, who appear on their family reality television series, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and its spinoffs.\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nKardashian was born in Los Angeles, California. He has a sister and brother, Barbara and Tom Kardashian.[2][3] His great-grandparents, Saghatel (\"Sam\") and Harom Kardaschoff, were ethnic Armenian Spiritual Christian Prygun[4] immigrants from Karakale (now: Merkezkarakale), Kars Oblast of the Russian Empire (now Kars Province in Turkey). The family, known at the time by the surname Kardaschoff, in Russian style, made their way from their home village of Karakale probably to Bremerhaven, Germany, a popular emigration port. From there, they travelled to a new life in America. Their son Tatos anglicized his name to Tom, started a business in garbage collection in Los Angeles, and married another Kars-Karakale immigrant, Hamas Shakarian.[5]\n\nGrowing up in the Baldwin Hills area of Los Angeles, Kardashian attended Susan Miller Dorsey High School and the University of Southern California, from which he graduated in 1966 with a B.S. degree in business administration.[6] He earned a J.D. degree from the University of San Diego School of Law and practiced for about a decade; after that, he went into business. In 1973, Kardashian was one of the co-founders of the trade publication Radio & Records, which he and his partners sold for a large profit in 1979.[6] Kardashian also pioneered the idea of playing music between movies in theaters. He subsequently parlayed the concept into a business, starting a company called Movie Tunes.[7][8][9][10] He served as President and CEO of the firm and later invested in Juice Inc., a frozen yogurt company, and in a music video business called Concert Cinema.[11][12]\n\nMarriages and children [ edit ]\n\nRobert Kardashian dated Priscilla Presley from 1975 to 1976.\n\nHe had four children with his first wife, Kris Kardashian (n\u00e9e Houghton, subsequently Jenner): Kourtney, Kimberly, Khlo\u00e9, and Rob.[13] The couple separated and divorced in 1991.[citation needed]\n\nShortly after separating from his first wife in 1991, Kardashian became engaged to Denice Shakarian Halicki, widow of movie producer H.B. Halicki.[14][15] The couple never married. In 1998, Kardashian married Jan Ashley; however, the marriage ended in annulment 30 days later. Ashley later claimed frequent upset and turmoil related to Kardashian's ex-wife Kris and their children \"were instrumental\" in the demise of the relationship.[16][17][18] After dating for three years and proposing in 2001, Kardashian married his third wife, Ellen Pierson (n\u00e9e Markowitz), six weeks prior to his death.[19][20]\n\nO. J. Simpson case [ edit ]\n\nKardashian and Simpson first met in the early 1970s and became close friends.[20]\n\nFollowing the June 12, 1994, murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, Simpson stayed in Kardashian's house to avoid the media. Kardashian was the man seen carrying Simpson's garment bag the day that Simpson flew back from Chicago. Prosecutors speculated that the bag may have contained Simpson's bloody clothes or the murder weapon.[21] When Simpson failed to turn himself in at 11 a.m. on June 17, 1994, Kardashian read a letter by Simpson to the assembled media. This letter was interpreted by many as a suicide note.[22]\n\nSimpson was charged with the murders and subsequently acquitted of all criminal charges in a controversial criminal trial. Kardashian had let his license to practice law become inactive before the Simpson case but reactivated it to aid in Simpson's defense as a volunteer assistant on his legal team, alongside Simpson's main defense attorneys, Robert Shapiro and Johnnie Cochran. As one of Simpson's lawyers and a member of the defense \"Dream Team\", Kardashian could not be compelled or subpoenaed to testify against Simpson in the case, which included Simpson's past history and behavior with his ex-wife Nicole, and as to the contents of Simpson's garment bag.[23] He sat by Simpson throughout the trial.[20]\n\nKardashian visited Simpson in jail regularly. According to an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Kardashian said, \"I've never been in a jail before. It's extremely depressing. It makes me sick every time I go down there. We can't have any physical contact. I want to hug him, I want to show him that I care. It's very difficult.\"[citation needed]\n\nThe New York Times reported that Mr. Kardashian said in a 1996 ABC interview that he questioned Mr. Simpson's innocence: \"I have doubts. The blood evidence is the biggest thorn in my side; that causes me the greatest problems. So I struggle with the blood evidence.\"[23]\n\nDeath [ edit ]\n\nKardashian was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in July 2003. He died few months later, on September 30, 2003, age 59,[24] and was buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.[25]\n\nIn popular culture [ edit ]\n\nKardashian was portrayed by David Schwimmer in the 2016 FX miniseries American Crime Story: The People v. O. J. Simpson.\n\nIn 2017, Kardashian was the subject of the pilot episode of the TV comedy series Over My Dead Body on Amazon Prime.[26]\n\nSee also [ edit ]"}

'He's made it very clear.'\n\nBoth Jonathan and Molly were dreading their separate get-togethers with the show's other participants because they knew they would have to admit that they were getting a divorce.\n\n'I have to tell them my marriage is just over,' Jonathan said. 'I feel like a loser.'\n\nHe was once again forced to recount how he recorded Molly berating him and showed it to Dr. Jessica Griffin, who pointed out that it was verbal and emotional abuse.\n\nUncomfortable: Molly also felt awkward telling Jaclyn (right) and Shawniece Jackson, 29, that she was getting a divorce\n\nPlaying innocent: Molly once again glossed over specifics when she explained why she and Jonathan were giving up on their marriage\n\n'Molly and I have already decided that it's a no,' he said. 'We both know that we are walking into decision day saying no.'\n\nAlthough Jonathan and Molly were the only couple who didn't consummate their marriage, the other guys were understandably shocked by the revelation.\n\nMeanwhile, Molly once again glossed over specifics when she told the girls that she had moved out and was getting a divorce.\n\nShe claimed their marriage couldn't work if their physical chemistry didn't increase, noting that Jonathan was unable to be patient with her without constantly blowing up over their lack of intimacy.\n\nTowards the end of the episode, Jonathan had to tell his mom, Cheryl, and stepfather, Richard, that he and Molly were calling it quits.\n\nStressed: Jonathan was understandably nervous before telling his mom, Cheryl, and stepfather, Richard, that he and Molly were getting a divorce\n\nFamily ties: However, they were nothing but supportive after he shared his news\n\nHe explained that the visit was even more awkward because his mother had expected Molly to be with him. Cheryl was invested in their marriage and had already exchanged phone numbers with Molly's mom.\n\nHowever, when Jonathan told them that he was getting a divorce, they were nothing but supportive. His stepfather even told him that he admired him for taking a chance on love.\n\nJonathan was the only person on the show who gave up his apartment for good, and now he was trying to figure out where to live.\n\n'I don't have a job, so I can pick any place,' he joked. '[It is the] silver lining of being homeless and unemployed.'\n\nWhile Jonathan was away, Jaclyn Schwartzberg, 29, went over their apartment to help Molly pack. Molly said she had sent a long text to Jonathan in hopes that they could part amicably and leave the show in a good place, but he never responded.\n\nTough luck: When Jaclyn helped Molly pack her things, Molly revealed that she had sent a long text to Jonathan in hopes that they could party amicably, but he didn't respond\n\nBlindsided: Jaclyn was shocked when Ryan told her that he hadn't decided what he was going to say on decision day\n\nThe couple's breakup was weighing on the rest of the newlyweds, who were also unsure if they were on the verge of getting a divorce.\n\nWhen he had the guys over to his apartment, Jaclyn's husband Ryan Buckley, 29, confessed that he was having trouble talking to his wife, explaining that she shuts down whenever he shares his concerns that their constant fighting was unhealthy.\n\nNot only did he admit that he didn't feel close to her anymore, he claimed he didn't even care about her.\n\n'If I were to cut ties, I honestly wouldn't be heartbroken at all,' he said, pointing out that it was a warning sign that he didn't feel anything when he thought about divorcing his wife.\n\nBoth Jonathan and Jephte Pierre, 26, thought Ryan was all over the place with his feelings and was likely acting out of fear.\n\nStunned: 'I thought we both knew that we wanted to see this past decision day, at least because we had so much going for us,' she said\n\nBack on? Just when Jaclyn though their marriage was doomed, he surprised her with a necklace made out of flowers from their wedding day\n\nGiving it another go: Ryan and Jaclyn shared a kiss after making up yet again\n\nWhen Jaclyn returned home from her girls' night, he made it clear that he was on the fence about their marriage, which left her feeling blindsided.\n\n'I am completely caught off guard,' she said in her testimonial. 'I thought we both knew that we wanted to see this past decision day, at least because we had so much going for us.\n\n'I know we've had our battles and our wounds, but I thought we were on the same page, so I am feeling very blindsided.'\n\nIronically, just when Jaclyn though their marriage was doomed, he surprised her with a necklace made out of flowers from their wedding day as an apology for how he had been treating her.\n\nAnd Ryan wasn't the only one going to extremes. Jephte also ended up picking a silly fight with his wife Shawniece Jackson, 29, after they had a disagreement over who would drive that day.\n\nTrouble in paradise: Shawniece and Jephte go into a fight about who was going to drive\n\nConfused: 'My husband is mad because I didn't end up driving, and like why does that matter?' she said in her testimonial\n\n'My husband is mad because I didn't end up driving, and like why does that matter?' she asked, while her husband confessed to the cameras that her behavior had left him questioning whether or not she was the person he really wanted to be with forever.\n\nAlthough Shawniece didn't believe it was a big deal that she decided she didn't want to take her car that day, Jephte thought it was a warning sign that she wasn't a woman of her word.\n\n'I am still figuring out who she is, and I don't like when you say something and then do something different,' he admitted in his testimonial.\n\n'I'm not sure if that's the person I want to be spending the rest of my life with,' he added.\n\nShawniece, on the other hand, seemed more confident in her own decision, but noted that the stress of the show's finale may have had a negative impact on her husband as he attempted to figure out his future.\n\nTense: Jephte admitted that he was not sure Shawniece was the type of person he wanted to spend the rest of his life with, while she was nervous that he was going to ask for a divorce\n\nBouncing back: Although Jephte seemed genuinely upset at first, he ended up diffusing the situation by joking around and laughing with her\n\n'Maybe he is just stressed out \u2014 I guess about final decision \u2014 so who knows?' she said of his behavior.\n\nWith decision day right around the corner, Shawniece was worried that their latest squabble could be a sign that they are headed for divorce.\n\n'When he gets super annoyed with me, it just makes me really nervous and really scared for the future 'cause we only have a few days before final decision,' she says in her testimonial.\n\nAlthough Jephte seemed genuinely upset at first, he ended up diffusing the situation by joking around and laughing with her.\n\n'I am just proud that we are able to come back from the situation and be at the place where I know we can be,' Shawniece told the camera."}

{"label": true, "txt": "The Image Direct\n\nGisele Bundchen and Tom Brady were suited up the night before the Met Gala. The couple was spotted having a twinning moment yesterday, as they sported matching suits and white tees in New York City.\n\nThe supermodel opted for a tailored look with a cropped jacket, tapered trousers, heeled sandals and a circular clutch. Meanwhile, the Patriots quarterback added some unexpected texture to his outfit with a deep green velvet blazer over black jeans and boots.\n\nThe duo will serve as co-chairs for tonight's Met Gala, along with Katy Perry and Pharrell Williams. Bundchen and Brady, who wed in 2009, made their first joint appearance at the ball in 2008. This year's gala will mark their 10th time attending together.\n\nAfter teaching us a lesson in couple's twinning over the weekend, let's see if they'll match again tonight on the red carpet."}
{"label": true, "txt": "From the moment Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson made headlines as a new couple to watch, fans fell in love with their sweet relationship. Who doesn't remember that moment in Keeping Up With The Kardashians when Khloe brought her family to Cleveland to visit Tristan's house? She told them that Tristan wanted her to have all of her stuff in his closet so that she could feel at home and have everything she needed. How cute?! Of course, then the cheating scandals came, and for the past few months, Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan's relationship has seemed like it could break at any moment.\n\nCan't keep up with all of the drama? Here's a complete timeline of Khloe and Tristan's relationship...\n\nDecember 7, 2018:\n\nThings between Tristan and Khlo\u00e9 are MUCH better these days, so much so that Khlo\u00e9 is even considering getting pregnant again with the basketball player.\n\n\"Now that she's a mom, Khloe's never been happier,\" a source told Entertainment Tonight. \"She has wanted this baby more than anything and motherhood has proven to be even more incredible than she imagined.\"\n\nApparently the couple is in \"such a good place now\" after spending Thanksgiving together last month. \"Her relationship with Tristan is so good,\" said the source. \"They made it through some really dark times, but she's happy that she gave him a second chance because he's stepped up and is not only an amazing father to True, but he's been such a rock for Khlo\u00e9. They're really just so in love.\"\n\nThey're doing so well, that Khlo\u00e9 wants to start trying for a second kid. Getting pregnant with True wasn't easy and Khlo\u00e9 is \"aware it may take some time again,\" so she doesn't want to wait too long.\n\nIn other Kardashian news, Kylie is also interested in having baby number two with her bae, Travis Scott.\n\n\"Kylie and Travis are going to wait until he's finished his [Astroworld] tour before trying for another baby,\" ET's source said. \"They want to have another child soon so it's close in age to Stormi, but they do not want to do this while he's busy on the road.\"\n\nSince their first kids were born just months apart, and seem to have a close relationship, the sisters are apparently excited about the prospect of getting pregnant together again.\n\n\"Kylie and Khloe would love to be pregnant together again. And it seems like the timing could work out that way,\" said the source. \"It was a real bonding experience for them, but more importantly, it\u2019s been amazing for their daughters to be so close in age. There are so many kids/grandkids in that family, that's really where the family's attention is. It's all about the next generation.\"\n\nNovember 26, 2018:\n\nKhlo\u00e9 and Tristan had a quiet Thanksgiving together, as she joined him in Ohio for the big holiday. While many fans were questioning why Khlo\u00e9 decided to not be with her sisters for Thanksgiving dinner, she quickly shut down the haters down with a couple of tweets.\n\nY\u2019all are reaching now. I\u2019ve spent the past 3years in Cleveland for Thanksgiving. Not sure why people are trying to create drama between my family and I. My sisters and I are perfectly fine thank you! All of their families were able to travel but TT being in season, he can not \u2014 Khlo\u00e9 (@khloekardashian) November 24, 2018\n\nThe truth is never as fun as some story some of you like to create. So here we goooooooooooo!! Happy Thanksgiving I guess lol \u2014 Khlo\u00e9 (@khloekardashian) November 24, 2018\n\nKhlo\u00e9 also had to defend her sister Kendall on Friday night after she booed Tristan during a basketball game, where she was cheering on the Philadelphia 76ers' with Ben Simmons.\n\nA fan called out Khloe for her being okay with Kendall booing him during the game, but still supporting Tristan after he cheated on her.\n\nWhat he did was fucked up and disgusting. What you\u2019re watching is over seven months old. We have gone through countless hours of help. My sister was watching HER man Play against my man\u2026 So of course she\u2019s going to heckle the opposing team. Why are you confused? \u2014 Khlo\u00e9 (@khloekardashian) November 25, 2018\n\nDespite what people believed to be a shady interaction between Kendall and Tristan, the two of them were all smiles when they saw each other at the game.\n\nGetty Images Mitchell Leff\n\nThe Cleveland Caveliers ended up winning the game, so it's safe to say that the two of them are even now.\n\nNovember 18, 2018:\n\nKeeping Up with the Kardashian's retell of True's birth confirmed what we already knew: that the baby's delivery, which occurred just days after it was revealed that Tristan had cheated of Khlo\u00e9, was awkward af.\n\nNot only were there some savage moments from Khloe's sisters (Tristan saying \"girls change your life,\" with Kourt responding, \"we can only pray.\" AMEN), but there was also so much tension.\n\ngiphy\n\nAfter the ep aired, Khlo\u00e9 shared a pic from the occasion on her Instagram story, and you can feel the awkwardness in the photo, let me tell you.\n\nInstagram\n\n\"This is one of the most awkward photos I have seen in a long time,\" she wrote about the pic. \"You can feel the tension lol but it makes me laugh for some reason. I am definitely one of those people that when I am uncomfortable I nervously laugh. Welcome to my labor lol.\"\n\nWe're glad she can laugh about it, because all we can manage is a cringe.\n\nNovember 15, 2018:\n\nForget what you heard because Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan are reportedly doing very well despite breakup rumors. A source told TMZ that the couple is \"still together and going strong.\" According to the site, Khlo\u00e9 hasn't been in Cleveland because she's filming a new season of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, and then she wanted to stay with her family this past week amid the California fires.\n\nThe reality star will be heading to Ohio soon, however. She plans to spend Thanksgiving with Tristan and True in Cleveland as a family.\n\nThis all comes as the cheating episodes of KUWTK are airing on TV, episodes which Tristan refused to watch. But hey, if they're doing better, why relive the past?\n\nNovember 7, 2018:\n\nWhile Tristan Thompson seemed to have no issue cheating on Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian when she was nine-months pregnant back in April, he has not interest in reliving the experience through Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\n\nAccording to Us Weekly, when Khlo\u00e9 asked Tristan if he wanted to watch the KUWTK episode that addressed the cheating scandal, \"the response was a firm no.\" Apparently while Khlo\u00e9 already screened the ep before it aired, she wanted to watch it live with her boyfriend.\n\nTristan has a lot of other things to worry about. A source close to him told Us that \"he is focused on basketball, and the Cavaliers are struggling this season.\" Watching the episode would only create further distractions, and \"there wasn't any need for that.\" Of course, he could have not cheated on her in the first place, then this issue wouldn't exist at all.\n\n\n\nOctober 31, 2018:\n\nTristan took to Instagram to show off photos of True's first Halloween. The basketball player shared a super cute pic of his daughter dressed like a flamingo, sitting on his head.\n\nInstagram\n\nIn another photo, Khlo\u00e9 joined in on the fun. This family get-together comes amid rumors of Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan's impending breakup. After another cheating allegation came to light recently, Khlo\u00e9 decided to delay her move to Cleveland, where Tristan is currently living.\n\nInstagram\n\nIn the past week, however, the two have seemed to be on better terms. Khlo\u00e9 did end up going to visit Tristan in Ohio briefly, and, when Khlo\u00e9 got home from her Bali trip last week, he surprised her with balloons.\n\nThis Sunday, Keeping Up with the Kardashians will air the aftermath of Tristan's original cheating scandal, which occurred days before True's birth. It will be interesting to see how re-living that dark time will affect Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan's current relationship.\n\nOctober 29, 2018:\n\nKhlo\u00e9 and Tristan seem to be back on good terms after Khlo\u00e9's recent vacation with Kim and their kids.\n\nThe two of them returned from their big trip to Bali and Khlo\u00e9 had a very special surprise waiting for her at home when she got back. Tristan got her some special balloons to welcome her back and Khloe was super excited to share them on her Instagram story\n\nInstagram\n\nSoon after, she posted another photo of a quote that seemed to be hinting at a reconciliation.\n\nInstagram\n\n\"Please stop overthinking life like you have an answer to every feeling or rituation. That's not how life works We figure it all out by just living, by f*cking up, by missing an. opportunity, by seeking advice and not taking it. We learn what's important and what isn't. Sometimes we have no f*cking idea what to do and it's scary but it's okay. Always trust your gut and know that everything will work out exactly the way it is supposed to be. It always does. Relax, we were never in control anyway.\"\n\nOctober 23, 2018:\n\nSix months after Tristan's first cheating scandal, which occurred just a few days before the birth of their child, True Thompson, Khlo\u00e9 finally \"seems over Tristan,\" according to People.\n\nThis feeling has manifested itself in her move to Cleveland, which she hasn't rescheduled, despite postponing it three weeks ago. \"It doesn\u2019t seem to bother her that she isn\u2019t with Tristan in Cleveland,\" said People's source. \"She seems to know what she wants in her life right now. And it definitely doesn\u2019t seem like she wants to be with Tristan.\"\n\nAs far as their future, however, Khlo\u00e9 hasn't yet made a decision. \"Khlo\u00e9 isn\u2019t saying that she and Tristan split. It seems she hasn\u2019t decided yet what she wants to do about their relationship,\" the source said. \"And she seems fine about this.\"\n\n\n\nOctober 14, 2018:\n\nThings don't seem to be going well for the couple, despite the fact that Khlo\u00e9 took a solo trip to see Tristan in Cleveland.\n\nWhile the two seemed to have plenty of time to talk to one another during her two day visit, it seems like the couple isn't doing too well despite their time together.\n\n\"Khlo\u00e9 is stable, content and very happy with being a mom and with how things are going with True,\" a source told People. \"As for Tristan, things are still quite up in the air between them. Things seem more unstable in the relationship right now, but she\u2019s taking it all in stride.\"\n\n\n\nWhile the two haven't officially said anything in terms of their current relationship status, Khlo\u00e9 has been posting several messages on her Instagram that seem to hint at a major dent in their relationship.\n\nHere's hoping the couple can work things out again.\n\nOctober 6, 2018:\n\nAfter a week of posting emotional Instagrams amid new rumors that Tristan Thompson is once again cheating, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian has postponed her move to Cleveland. Khlo\u00e9 was planning on returning to Ohio to live with Tristan as the basketball season begins, but, according to People, this is no longer the case.\n\n\"It\u2019s of course difficult to trust someone 100 percent who cheated days before he was about to become a dad,\" said People's source. \"Khlo\u00e9 still struggles with this sometimes. She wants to move back to Cleveland, but she isn\u2019t sure what date she is [going]. The move is postponed for now. She seems very upset about leaving her family. She had the best summer in L.A.\"\n\nAll of this is happening as Keeping Up with the Kardashians is preparing to air the original cheating scandal, which occurred about six months ago, right before True Thompson was born. This has caused Khlo\u00e9 to become \"overwhelmed and exhausted,\" according to the source.\n\n\"Khlo\u00e9 has every reason to occasionally feel [that way],\u201d they added. \"She\u2019s a new mom, a first-time mom, and her TV show is currently replaying one of the most emotional times in her life. It\u2019s a lot.\"\n\nOctober 4, 2018:\n\nKhloe took to Instagram stories to post a very mysterious text image that reads: \"If you've been brutally broken but still have the courage to be gentle to other living beings, then you're a badass with a heart of an angel.\"\n\nInstagram\n\nThe image was posted late last night.\n\nThis post from Koko comes on the heels of more alleged Tristan drama. A few weeks ago, Tristan was seen walking out of a club (seemingly) with two girls. Koko fans pounced when the info dropped, claiming that he was back at his cheating ways.\n\n\n\nSeptember 27, 2018:\n\nIt seems like we're about to get a lot more info on the Tristan cheating scandal and how Khlo\u00e9's family reacted to the original news back in April. In a mid-season preview for Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Kim Kardashian is seen saying, \"They have another video of him.\" While we don't know for sure that she's referring to Tristan, the promo then switches to a pic of Khlo\u00e9, who looks less than happy. So, we can assume Kim means the paparazzi got another vid of Tristan with a random girl.\n\n\"Unfollowed,\" says Kim, and we know she did, actually unfollow him on Instagram. \"I hate him. Sorry, not sorry.\" Khlo\u00e9, on the other hand, seems more calm as she prepares to give birth to her baby, True. \u201cThe things I can control, I have to be able to control,\" she says.\n\nWe can't wait for the second half of KUWTK to see what Khlo\u00e9's family thought about everything that went down with Tristan, though we already know they don't think too highly of him.\n\nSeptember 26, 2018:\n\nTristan Thompson was, once again, spotted getting very close to not-Khlo\u00e9 at a club in LA recently. According to Us Weekly, \"Tristan and a girl were chatting and flirting throughout the night. They were very touchy-feely. He had his hand on her butt.\"\n\nKhlo\u00e9, who will be moving back to Cleveland when basketball season kicks off, is apparently unbothered by the allegation. A source says that she believes Tristan, who promised to \"never betray her again.\"\n\nHer family, however, is not on the same page. \"Everyone is flabbergasted, but her family has learned to keep their opinions quiet,\" said a source. \"People underestimate the threshold of what she\u2019ll put up with for love.\"\n\nSeptember 19, 2018: It looks like LA will be losing a Kardashian. Khloe plans to move back to Cleveland with Tristan for basketball season, which is about to start up again soon. While it's good to see that the couple will still be together while Tristan plays for the Cleveland Cavaliers, a source told People that the move will be hard on Khloe.\n\n\"He has games in October. They are all moving back to Cleveland, and it\u2019s hard for Khlo\u00e9. She will really miss Kris and her sisters,\" they told People.\n\nDespite the big move, the source said that they plan to make frequent visits back to LA to try to keep the family together.\n\n\"It\u2019s not going to be easy for her,\" the source told People. \"But she is committed to keeping her family together. And Tristan has shown that he is committed to Khloe, so Khloe will make it work.\"\n\nWhile Khloe plans to make the big move, it looks like another Kardashian is staying put.\n\nKim doesn't plan to move to Chicago with Kanye, despite the fact that he recently announced that he will be moving back there soon.\n\n\"Kim plans on spending more time in Chicago, but she isn\u2019t moving there full-time,\" a source told People.\n\nThe source also told People that Kim believes that a move wouldn't make sense for the kids right now and that it's likely that Kanye will change his mind and move back to LA soon.\n\n\"She will be supportive of Kanye\u2019s plans and they do have a house in Chicago too. Kanye has a tendency though to change his mind quickly, so she is just going along with his plans because it makes him happy,\" the source said. \"Next week, something else might make him happier.\"\n\nSeptember 4, 2018: Things seem to be going well for Khloe and Tristan, but that doesn't mean you should expect them to walk down the aisle anytime soon.\n\n\n\nKhloe went off on Instagram after she was tagged in a post by Perez Hilton about her and Tristan planning to get married soon.\n\n\"Who makes up this crap you guys post?? This is how slow the news is? You need this ridiculous story?? What a waste,\" she wrote, according to Comments by Celebs.\n\nComments by Celebs took Khloe's side of the argument, but when a fan tried to question her relationship, she fired back.\n\n\"So she's acting like Tristan didn't cheat? Like it was made up by blogs? Lol,\" a commenter posted.\n\n\"I'm not acting as if Tristan didn't cheat. I'm saying the story about marriage and anyone insinuating they know what we speak about privately is 'crap.' Not upset by commenters. Not upset by anything. Only pointing out when blogs create stories for you all to believe when it's just simply untrue.\"\n\nInstagram\n\nAugust 9, 2018: While many of the Kardashian/Jenner ladies were accompanied by their men at Kylie's 21st birthday party, Tristan was nowhere to be seen. According to TMZ, the basketball player was in Toronto at a fundraising event for epilepsy.\n\nTristan's presence was missed in more ways than one at the event. A mural that took up a whole wall of the party featured everyone in Kylie's life. The late Rob Kardashian was included, as well as Stormi Webster, and even Kendall Jenner's new BF, Ben Simmons.\n\nMissing from the mural was Tristan, which is strange considering he has been with Khlo\u00e9 for almost two years AND they have a kid together. Maybe it's a sign that the Kardashian crew is very anti-Tristan.\n\nInstgram\n\nAugust 1, 2018: Despite rumors that the couple aren't doing so well, Tristan and Khloe seem to be doing just fine. Tristan even commented on Khloe's Instagram featuring pink and blue beach waves and the caption, \"take me please.\"\n\nTristan adorably responded to her photo by asking her, \"where do you want to go my love?\" While Khloe hasn't yet responded to the comment, her fans have been having a field day responding back to Tristan and reminding him of his cheating scandal.\n\n\n\nLooks like her fans aren't ready to forgive Tristan just yet, even though they are clearly trying to make it work.\n\nJuly 25, 2018: It looks like not everything is what it seems between Khloe and Tristan. The couple seem to be having trouble together and it looks like Tristan is the one that wants out of the relationship.\n\n\u201cKhlo\u00e9 and Tristan are still not fully OK,\u201d a source told US Weekly. \u201cThey act like they are when they\u2019re in front of others, but it\u2019s all a show at this point.\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to US Weekly, Tristan has stopped going to couples therapy with Khloe and has openly shared that he wants to move back to Cleveland.\n\n\u201cTristan is feeling trapped in a bad relationship,\u201d another source said. \u201cHe\u2019s no longer going with Khloe for sessions. He just didn\u2019t feel it was helping to discuss s**t that happened months ago.\u201d\n\nJuly 11, 2018: Tristan just couldn't wait to share a dance with baby True and, luckily for us, Khloe was right there to film the beautiful moment.\n\nKhloe shared the video on her on Snapchat of the two sharing a father-daughter dance together. Khloe can be heard laughing in the background while watching them. Check out the adorable video below:\n\nJune 26, 2018: Tristan posted a video of him and baby True on Snapchat and it is absolutely adorable!

This is the first time the basketball star has posted a pic of him and his daughter, True. He captioned the photo with a red heart. So cute! The photo also features a basketball, a Koko-approved candy-filled canister, and a comfy AF-looking chaise lounge chair.\n\nJune 21, 2018: The couple that works out together, stays together. Khloe showed off her at-home workout with her personal trainer Don and a familiar figure joined them in the middle of her session. Tristan was seen doing his own training alongside Khloe in some of the videos that she posted on her Snapchat.\n\nSnapchat\n\nJune 20, 2018: While Khloe and Tristan haven't been completely open about the cheating scandal that almost ruined their relationship, a source told UsWeekly that it will be addressed in the next season of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\n\n\"They always discuss real life things on the show. They\u2019ve never ignored a topic,\" a source told Us Weekly. \"It will definitely be brought up, but they don\u2019t know how much. They can film hours about it, but in the end, Khloe is one of the executive producers and will have final say on what actually makes air.\"\n\nThe source also says that Tristan is upset that it will be talked about on the show, but Khloe has assured him that it will only be a small part of the season.\n\nJune 19, 2018: The Kardashian clan has officially forgiven Tristan for cheating on Khloe and he is planning to move to Los Angeles for the summer.\n\nAccording to Entertainment Tonight, Tristan is currently staying over Khloe's house in Los Angeles in an effort to work on their relationship.\n\n\u201c[Tristan] has a home in L.A. too, but the plan is to live together as a family at Khloe\u2019s home as they continue to work on their relationship,\u201d a source told Entertainment Tonight. \u201cEveryone is back on board -- friends, family and Khloe have all forgiven him and are giving him this second chance -- and so far it\u2019s been working for them.\u201d\n\n\n\nKhloe and Tristan have been spending a lot of time together in Los Angeles. They recently went on a date night with sister Kendall Jenner and her rumored boyfriend, Ben Simmons, and they were seen together at a McDonald's drive-thru.\n\nJune 18, 2018: Looks like Tristan is in the City of Angels as he was spotted hanging out with Khloe at Dave Chappelle's private friends and family only private show, taking a night off from being with baby True. E! News also reports that Kendall and her rumored boyfriend, Ben Simmons, also joined them. Later, they moved to Poppy nightclub, where they also met up with Kris and Corey Gamble, according to Entertainment Tonight .Despite them now being in Los Angeles together, there's still no word on whether Tristan will be moving in or if he is just visiting for now.\n\n\n\nJune 17, 2018: On Father's Day, Khloe and baby True traveled from Cleveland to Los Angeles after the end of NBA season. Kylie and Stormi decided to give them a very special welcome back home with a teddy bear and balloons that said, \"welcome home, Khloe and True. Stormi and Kylie - we love you.\"\n\nInstagram\n\nAccording to E! News, the Kardashian family are very happy to see Khloe back in LA and that they'll see more of True.\n\n\"The whole family is thrilled that Khloe is home and that they will get to be close by and an every day part of True's life. They made it a big celebration and welcome home for her.\"\n\nE! News also reported that Father's Day was going to be a rough day for Khloe and she specifically wanted to spend it with her sisters.\n\nTristan also took to Instagram to give a shout out to his two children for Father's Day with two new necklaces with their names on them.\n\nThere's no word if Tristan will be moving out to Los Angeles to be with Khloe and True, but with the end of basketball season, it's likely that he will also make the big move soon.\n\nJune 13, 2018: Khloe shares a cute pic of her baby girl to celebrate her 2-month birthday. The photo is caption: \"Baby True.\" What a cutie!\n\nKhloe shared the first video of True (complete with a fun IG filter) for her 1-month birthday. If it continues like this, we'll have to set an alarm for the 12th of every month so that we can be sure to catch of new glance of Koko's cutie.\n\nKoko's pic of True comes right after sister Kylie swore off sharing pictures of her baby, Stormi. After receiving some negative comments about Stormi on Instagram, Kylie decided that she's not here for the trolls.\n\nAn insider told People:\n\n\u201cKylie felt so protective of her baby when she was pregnant. This is why she didn\u2019t share any bump pictures while she was pregnant. After Stormi was born, Kylie was the proudest mom.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe couldn\u2019t wait to show off Stormi to her fans. She posted pictures, because she was so excited to be a mom. Unfortunately, social media is a crazy place. People have been making nasty comments.\"\n\n\u201cKylie is shocked and doesn\u2019t want her daughter\u2019s pictures to be a part of something negative. She might reconsider in the future, but for now, she won\u2019t post any more photos of Stormi\u2019s face.\u201d\n\nJune 7, 2018: Don't get it twisted: Just because Khloe seems to be back on with Tristan doesn't mean her family in on board. A source told People that Tristan will be returning to Cali with Khloe (and baby True in tow), but that the Kardashians aren't thrilled about it. Apparently, they are still \"very unhappy\" with him. \u201cIt will be interesting to see how they will treat him. Although Khlo\u00e9 defends him and her reasons to stay with him, her family feels she deserves much better,\u201d the source told the outlet.\n\n\n\nJune 4, 2018: Khloe and True are moving back to Los Angeles, according to a very reliable source, momager Kris Jenner. \"We go back and forth,\" Kris told E! News when asked how often she saw Khloe (who is currently in Cleveland). \"I FaceTime with her every day. So that's a lot of fun.... She'll be home soon.\"\n\nJune 3, 2018: Some Koko fans are not loving the star's decision to stay with Tristan, and they are letting it be KNOWN. One person tweeted at the celeb, saying: \u201cA year from now @khloekardashian will be over all of this and feeling salty for her super passive IG posts. She\u2019s just in the stage of \u2018but I love him!\u2019 Until then let her pretend he\u2019s changed and they\u2019ll be a happy family. #WednesdayWisdom.\u201d\n\nDamn. Well, if this fan thought her tweet would just evaporate into the inter-ether, she was damn wrong. Khlo\u00e9 shot back,\u201cBabe that\u2019s not wisdom at all because you\u2019re assuming you know who I\u2019m talking about and you\u2019re assuming you know my feelings. Assuming anything is anything but wisdom.\"\n\nTouch\u00e9.\n\nMay 31, 2018: In case you were wondering how Kanye felt about Tristan's cheating scandal, well, now you know. Kanye hosted a listening party for his new album \"Ye\" in Wyoming, and people immediately picked up on a reference to Tristan's cheating scandal in one of the songs.\n\n\n\n\"All these thots on Christian Mingle / That\u2019s what almost got Tristan single / If you don\u2019t ball like him or Kobe / Guarantee that bitch gon\u2019 leave you,\" he says.\n\n\n\nFans were shook, to say the least.\n\nKanye saying Tristan Thompson was almost single after using Christian Mingle pic.twitter.com/RCaZPhgWj3 \u2014 Morgan A Baila (@morganbaila) June 1, 2018\n\nYo did @kanyewest really just reference Tristan Thompsons cheating scandal as if the girl he cheated on isn't his sister-in-law? Jesus \ud83d\ude05 \u2014 jimmypistachio. (@jimmypistachio) June 1, 2018\n\nMay 30, 2018: Sounds like Tristan is throwing himself a bit of a pity party. A source told Us Weekly that Tristan is \"completely emotionally and physically exhausted from the cheating allegations and of course the playoffs.\" Ok, yes, the playoffs are a big deal, but is he seriously complaining about the drama that he started?! Unbelievable.\n\nBut that's not all we have to report on this drama-filled day. Khloe took to Twitter and clapped back at a woman who shared some pretty judge #WednesdayWisdom, concerning the cheating scandal.\n\n\"A year from now @khloekardashian will be over all of this and feeling salty for her super passive IG posts. She\u2019s just in the stage of \u201cbut I love him!\u201d Until then let her pretend he\u2019s changed and they\u2019ll be a happy family. #WednesdayWisdom,\" the Twitter user wrote.\n\n\n\nKhloe responded, \"Babe that\u2019s not wisdom at all because you\u2019re assuming you know who I\u2019m talking about and you\u2019re assuming you know my feelings. Assuming anything is anything but wisdom.\"\n\nBabe that\u2019s not wisdom at all because you\u2019re assuming you know who I\u2019m talking about and you\u2019re assuming you know my feelings. Assuming anything is anything but wisdom \u2014 Khlo\u00e9 (@khloekardashian) May 30, 2018\n\nMay 15, 2018: Khloe gets real about who truly thought of the adorable name True for her baby girl. \u201cMy grandma MJ suggested True,\" the star wrote on her app. \"She told me it was my great-grandfather\u2019s first name and my grandfather\u2019s middle name. It stuck with me for my entire pregnancy and was the only one I couldn\u2019t get out of my head.\u201d So cute!\n\nMay 14, 2018: Khloe (kind of, sort of) made her first statement regarding Tristan's cheating scandal. On her Instagram stories, she published the quote, \"It's all about who you look for in a crowded room. That's where your heart belongs.\" Khloe has posted quotes on Instagram before, but this one seems pretty intentional.\n\n\n\nInstagram\n\nMay 13, 2018: Looks like Khloe had a really good first Mother's Day! In case you missed it, she took to Snapchat and posted this cute pic of her True in honor of the holiday.\n\n\n\nSnapchat\n\nOn her Instagram stories, she shared pics of a beautiful flower arrangement and \"KOKO\" balloons, which you can see, below. Now, the question is, who sent those gifts?! Was it Tristan Thompson or someone from the family, like Kris Jenner?\n\nInstagram\n\nInstagram\n\nInstagram\n\nMay 12, 2018: Khloe finally introduced her daughter True to the world with a super cute video on Instagram. In the video, True is rocking a floral Snapchat filter and batting her adorable eyes at the camera. \"Happy One Month True,\" Khloe wrote.\n\nInteresting enough, some fans think True looks a lot like her cousin, Stormi Webster (a.k.a. Kylie Jenner's daughter). Do you see the resemblance?\n\nMay 11, 2018: Ever since True's birth, fans have been anxiously awaiting the first pic of Khloe's darling baby girl. And that day has finally come... though it seems like it may have happened by accident!\n\nKhloe posted a few quick selfies on Snapchat. In them, she looks glam as hell, lying on her bed and rocking a camo sweatshirt. But, if you look at the corner of the image, you can spot baby True's tiny little hand.\n\nSnapchat\n\nTrue seems to be wearing a light pink and white onesie. And she just looks oh-so-cozy on her mama's chest. So precious.\n\nMay 10, 2018: Apparently, Tristan blocked Khloe's sister Kim on social media after she addressed the cheating scandal during an episode of The Ellen Degeneres Show.\n\n\n\n\"Like, I don\u2019t even know how to describe it other than it\u2019s just so f*cked up,\" she said at the time. \"We really were rooting for Khlo\u00e9. And we still are. She\u2019s so strong and she\u2019s doing the best she can. It\u2019s a really sad situation all over.\"\n\nSince then, she has appeared on Live With Kelly and Ryan. Naturally, Ryan Seacrest wanted to hear her thoughts on all the drama, and so he asked, \"Is there any part of you that roots for Khloe and Tristan?\"\n\nShe responded, \"OK, last time I went on TV and I answered some questions about her I got blocked on social media\u2014and not from Khloe. So, I'm going to...yes, I'm always rooting for her. I'm always rooting for love. I'm always rooting for families.\"\n\nInteresting answer, Kim. Very interesting.\n\nAlso, details about what went down in the delivery room continue to come to light. Apparently, before baby True broke through with her cry, someone else had a breakdown in the hospital room.\n\n\"Khlo\u00e9 has completely forgiven Tristan for cheating on her, and it really wasn\u2019t hard for her to do because he literally broke down crying in her hospital room after she had given birth to True,\" a source tells Us Weekly. \"Tristan was absolutely devastated that he had hurt and betrayed Khlo\u00e9. Adding to the grief, was of course the timing of when it all came out, the days before she gave birth.\"\n\nAnd it sounds like Tristan doesn't think that getting caught was necessarily a bad thing. \"Khlo\u00e9 has always said that everything happens for a reason, but absolutely loves Tristan,\" the source says. \"He actually told Khlo\u00e9 he was relieved that it had come out, and that he thinks subconsciously he wanted to get caught.\" The source went on to say that he \"knew there were paparazzi taking pics of him in New York City, but that didn\u2019t stop him from taking a woman back to his hotel.\"\n\n\n\nMay 9, 2018: Tristan finally opened up about his daughter True while on the basketball podcast Road Trippin. He revealed that she has green eyes and was born 21-inches long. Later on, he explained the difference between raising his first-born, Prince, and True.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think with a girl, you\u2019re just so much more emotionally like\u2026 with a boy, it\u2019s just like, \u2018Hey man, you\u2019ll be all right man. Stop crying,'\u201d he explained. \u201cBut [with True], it\u2019s like, \u2018True, it\u2019s gonna be okay. You know, we\u2019re right here. Daddy\u2019s here to feed you. It\u2019s me! Look, yeah!\u2019 It\u2019s way different, but it\u2019s fun, though. It changes you.\u201d\n\n\n\nFor the record, there's a lot of good that can come from parents letting their sons express a range of emotions, but looks like Tristan has a different perspective on that.\n\nMay 8, 2018: According to TMZ, Khloe and Tristan go out to see an afternoon movie together at a theater a few miles outside of Cleveland. The outlet says that they looked \"very much like a couple again.\" They were seen buying snacks in the theater lobby, and leaving in the same car after.\n\nThis movie outing comes at the same time that reports about how Khloe's family feels about the whole situation start to surface. According to TMZ, the Kardashians are \"outraged\" over Tristan's cheating scandal. However, they hope Khloe will remain civil with Tristan for True's sake. \"We're told the family privately feels they may never forgive Tristan, but they're not going to attempt to torpedo the relationship,\" the site wrote. Well, let's hope everyone can keep the peace.\n\n\n\nMay 7, 2018: Some fans thought Khloe naming her daughter True was ironic given Tristan's cheating scandal, but a source told Us Weekly Khloe and Tristan had picked their baby girl's name way before the news broke.\n\n\n\n\u201cTrue had already been picked for a while,\u201d the source said. \u201cShe went into labor not even knowing the full scope of the cheating so the option of changing her name wasn\u2019t even brought up. It\u2019s too much for one person to deal with during the crazy time.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe source added, \u201cA lot of people thought she\u2019d change the name and were waiting to send her gifts. Everything that Khloe bought during her pregnancy was already monogrammed True.\u201d\n\n\n\nMay 5, 2018: According to E! News, Khloe reportedly attended Tristan Thompson's basketball game, in which the Cleveland Cavaliers played against the Toronto Raptors. An eyewitness told the outlet Khloe arrived a little bit into the first quarter but stayed until the end. Throughout the game, she was cheering, clapping, and interacting with the fans around her. And as you might expect, she looked fabulous AF.\n\n\n\n\"She had her hair done and red lipstick on. She wore black aviators inside the whole game, only taking them off once to powder her face,\" the source said.\n\nMay 4, 2018: According to Us Weekly, Khloe and Tristan are \u201cfully back together.\u201d An insider told the site that Khloe has seen all of the photos and videos of Tristan with other woman. Yet, she's still in love with him.\n\nThe insider also said Khloe feels \u201cthe whole world is against Tristan.\u201d The Kardashian-Jenner family might the exception to that claim, but only for Khloe's sake.\n\n\u201cThose around Khlo\u00e9 are trying to be as supportive to her as they can. It\u2019s hard because if everyone distances themselves from Tristan, they\u2019ll risk losing Khlo\u00e9,\u201d the source said. \u201cLuckily there\u2019s this buffer time. She always planned to stay in Cleveland the first three months. Now with Tristan in the playoffs for possibly another month, no decision needs to be made right now.\u201d\n\n\n\nMay 2, 2018: Reports say Khloe disabled Instagram comments on every pic that includes Tristan. If you haven't noticed, you can see for yourself, below.\n\nInstagram\n\nHowever, the comments section on the photos that don't include Tristan have stayed the same.\n\nInstagram\n\nAlthough it's not clear when Khloe disabled the comments, it's probably safe to assume the change was made because of Tristan's cheating scandal. Many fans have been defending Khloe, but it's likely she wanted to keep the drama away from her feed. Meanwhile, fans are still posting hateful messages on Tristan's Instagram account.\n\n\n\nApril 29, 2018: Tristan finally broke his social media silence, but failed to address any of the cheating allegations. Instead, he celebrated his team's victory over the Indiana Pacers in an Instagram post. In the caption, he wrote, \"\"WHAT AN ATMOSPHERE IN THE Q!! GREAT WIN #OnToTheNextOne.\" Meanwhile, people defended Khloe Kardashian in the comments section.\n\n\n\n\"KHLOE BETTER BE ON TO THE NEXT ONE TOO \ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffc,\" one fan wrote.\n\n\n\nApril 24, 2018: Entertainment Tonight reports that an exclusive source says that Khloe is \"not in a bubble of denial. She knows what's going on and is still trying to process it, but so far, she's managed to move past it and look forward.\"\n\nThe source says that five women have come forward with cheating allegations. Some claim they had months-long affairs with Tristan and one woman even said she slept with him the night before Khloe's baby shower.\n\n\n\nEven with these reports, the insider says Khloe is set to stay put in Ohio... at least for now.\n\n\"Khloe is very settled in Cleveland right now and is planning on staying another few weeks to a month at least. Of course, that could change, especially since every day there seems to be more stories out about Tristan.\"\n\n\n\nApril 19, 2018: According to People, Tristan left Cleveland and made his way to Indianapolis, where he and his team (the Cleveland Cavaliers) will play against the Indiana Pacers in the NBA playoffs. This is reportedly the first time Tristan has left Cleveland since Khloe gave birth to their daughter, True.\n\nAlthough Khloe and her newborn daughter remain in Ohio, they will reportedly head to L.A. once they receive doctors' approval to fly. Given Tristan's recent cheating scandal, the move seems only natural.\n\nApril 16, 2018: In a super pink Instagram post, Khloe announced that her and Tristan's baby girl was named True Thompson. So cute!\n\n\n\n\"Our little girl, True Thompson, has completely stolen our hearts and we are overwhelmed with LOVE. Such a blessing to welcome this angel into the family! Mommy and Daddy loooooove you True!,\" she wrote.\n\n\n\nApril 12, 2018: Khloe gives birth to her and Tristan's baby girl. TMZ and E! News confirm the delivery with a source close to the couple. Kris and Kim reportedly flew to Cleveland to be by KoKo's side during the labor. ET reported that Kourtney and best friend, Malika Haqq, were in the delivery room when Khloe gave birth. Khloe reportedly arrived at the hospital on Wednesday night. Whether Tristan was present in the delivery room or not has yet to be confirmed, though TMZ also reported today that Kardashian would allow him in the delivery room with her.\n\nET's source says that Tristan has been \"apologetic and begging for forgiveness\" since the scandal.\n\nApril 11, 2018: Tristan Thompson is accused of cheating on Khloe Kardashian after videos of him getting intimate with several different women hit the web. First, the NBA player was spotted kissing a woman at a rooftop bar called PH-D in Manhattan. The woman is believed to be Instagram model Lani Blair. Footage obtained by TMZ also shows Tristan arriving at his hotel, after leaving the bar, with a mystery woman.\n\nTMZ\n\nThen, surveillance footage from October 2017 (when Khloe was three months pregnant) is released. It shows Tristan getting cozy with two women at a club outside of Washington D.C.\n\nThough neither Khloe Kardashian nor Tristan Thompson have commented on his alleged cheating, Page Six reports Khloe \"went absolutely ballistic\" on Tristan when she found out. She was \u201cdevastated when she saw the pictures of Tristan with that girl, she went absolutely ballistic at him,\" a source close to the Kardasian family reportedly said. \"She is not only hurt, she is humiliated and worried for their child. How could he do this, and so publicly, when their baby daughter could arrive within a week?\u201d\n\n\n\nApril 9, 2018: According to a report by TMZ, Khloe Kardashian is in Cleveland waiting to go into labor with boyfriend Tristan Thompson by her side.\n\nMarch 21, 2018: The eight-months-pregnant mom-to-be posts photos on Instagram of a steamy photoshoot where she rocks nothing but a lingerie set and a matching robe. The stunning photo has no caption.\n\nMarch 15, 2018: Fans wonder if Khloe and Tristan's baby will keep up with the Kardashian tradition of having a \"K\" first name. After Twitter tosses the question back and forth, Khloe decides to weigh in. \"I think im going with a T,\" she writes.\n\nI think im going with a T \u2014 Khlo\u00e9 (@khloekardashian) March 16, 2018\n\nMarch 11, 2018: Khloe and Tristan throw a very pink baby shower to celebrate their first daughter. According to People, the shower was sponsored by Amazon Baby Registry at the Hotel Bel-Air in Los Angeles.\n\nIn a sweet Instagram post, Khloe writes...\n\n\"\ud83d\udc95 Where do I even begin?!?! How do I even begin to give thanks and praise to ALL of the people who took part in helping create the most incredible baby shower? @jeffleatham and his ENTIRE team and @mindyweiss and her ENTIRE team, THANK YOU for creating the most magical memories I get to keep for the rest of my life!!! WOW, is truly all I can say! They say \u201clove is in the details\u201d, I couldn\u2019t agree more! Look at all the LOVE! From my mommy\u2019s hand written Baby Thompson sign to each and every flower placed. Love was involved! I wish I could post every single picture!

Apparently, he had an \"inappropriate encounter\" with not one, but TWO women.\n\nThompson was seen \"getting cozy\" with models Jasmine Rose and Maya Nova James out February 16, according to the report.\n\n\"Two girls were hanging out with Tristan and his crew, some other basketball players and Canadian friends, at Avenue in L.A. during All-Star Weekend,\" a source told Us Weekly. \"The girls were at his table and Tristan was paying more attention to one of them, but he wasn't all over her. These girls are models and were in a fashion show for Angel Brinks that weekend and are shooting a show with her.\"\n\nThings didn't get really inappropriate until later on when the group went to a bar called Lavoo Lounge. \"It was the group of guys and the two girls,\" the source revealed. \"Tristan wasn't kissing on the girls, but he had his arms around and on the one that looks more like Khlo\u00e9, Jasmine. Tristan was flirting with her and didn't look or act like someone who had a pregnant girlfriend. The flirting and body language were definitely inappropriate for someone in a serious relationship expecting a baby.\"\n\nFebruary 4, 2018: Khloe Kardashian shares an adorable pic from the pregnancy photoshoot she and Kylie Jenner did together when both of their pregnancies were under wraps.\n\n\n\nJanuary 5, 2018: Khloe sits down with Jimmy Kimmel to talk about how she found out she was pregnant. \"Tristan kept saying 'You're pregnant' and I was like: 'Be quiet.

It's so weird and surreal.\"\n\nJanuary 4, 2018: Khloe makes her first interview appearance baring the bump on the Ellen DeGeneres Show.

After the news broke Wednesday morning, Variety published a report with three women claiming the anchor had sexually harassed them, as well. One woman claimed the anchor gave her a sex toy as a present, along with an explicit note on how he would like to use it on her, while another claimed he exposed himself to her inside of his office. The latter also claimed that he had a button underneath his desk that could lock the door from the inside.\n\nNBC's Seth Meyers was one of the few stars of late-night TV that didn't address the media bombshell, but he tweeted an explanation why.\n\n\"Due to the tree lighting we taped tonight's show yesterday so if you're wondering why any of today's news is conspicuously absent this evening - now you know!\" Meyers wrote.\n\nMany of the late-night hosts also seemed pretty disturbed by other tweets on the subject from President Donald Trump.\n\nWow, Matt Lauer was just fired from NBC for \u201cinappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace.\u201d But when will the top executives at NBC & Comcast be fired for putting out so much Fake News.

The former morning show host has dressed up as Dolly Parton, a \"Baywatch\" girl, Paris Hilton, Jennifer Lopez and Lucy from \"Peanuts,\" to name a few.\n\nBut as Colbert pointed out, the initial allegation and subsequent termination was just the tip of the iceberg; it was allegations in the Variety article that he really found disturbing.\n\n\"It's bad enough that he gave her a sex toy, but he also gave her instructions? He found a way to mansplain sexual harassment,\" Colbert said. \"I'm going to say what that woman honestly could not at the moment, 'What a dick.'\"\n\nAs for Trump tweeting about the \"Fake News practitioners at NBC\" in his reaction to Lauer's termiantion, Colbert said: \"By fake news do you mean more than a dozen women accusing Trump of improper conduct or sexual assault? Is that what you mean by 'fake news?' Listen up! You don't get to comment; that is the pot calling the kettle at 3 AM asking what she's wearing.\"\n\n\"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"\n\nKimmel found out about the allegations when his wife looked at her phone Wednesday morning and said, \"Oh my God, Matt Lauer.\"\n\n\"Which of course I assumed he was dead so I guess this is better, I don't know,\" Kimmel said.\n\nWhile the ABC late-night host found the situation \"surprising,\" he was more angered by Trump's response on Twitter.\n\n\"I'll tell ya if anyone knows about inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace at NBC, it's Donald J. Trump,\" Kimmel said. \"Is he aware that he's him? I don't think he is.\"\n\n\"As far as Matt Lauer goes, what happens next? Does he have to do an emotional sit down interview with himself?\" Kimmel joked.\n\n\"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\"\n\nThe NBC late-night host found a way to inject some holiday spirit into the Lauer scandal.\n\n\"The Rockefeller Christmas tree was lit tonight,\" Fallon said. \"Also getting lit tonight, the HR rep over at the 'Today' show.\"\n\n\"If you're wondering where in the world is Matt Lauer, he's probably at a bar somewhere with Charlie Rose,\" the late-night host added.\n\nLike the rest of the late-night gang, Fallon also called out Trump's tweets.\n\n\"Actually President Trump tweeted about Matt Lauer being fired and went on to attack NBC News executives and Joe Scarborough.

We encourage Pixar to be leaders in bolstering, hiring, and promoting more diverse and female storytellers and leaders.

She is seeking an order that Corey Bohan\u2018s visitation with their one-year-old daughter, Kirra, be stripped and that a restraining order be issued against him.\n\nPatridge claims during a court-ordered hand-off with their daughter on March 5, Corey threatened her by saying, \u201cYou better start f**king playing nice, I\u2019m f**king warning you.\u201d She says she recorded that incident, but claims on other occasions Bohan has aggressively followed her out of the parking lot and \u201cone time swerved his vehicle dangerously close to my sister.\u201d\n\nPatridge also claims her ex is \u201cstalking\u201d her on social media by picking apart her public posts and trying to attack her character. One example she references is after a post about attending church, Bohan allegedly posted on his own social media, \u201cONE THING I CANNOT STAND IS THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE PURE EVIL PUSHING THE \u2018I LOVE CHURCH\u2019 BEHAVIOR.\u201d\n\nShe says Bohan\u2019s obvious response to her posting supports her theory that he is keeping tabs on her, as well as publicly disparaging her.\n\nPatridge claims Bohan is being \u201cangry, rude and emotionally abusive\u201d towards Kirra, and tells her that \u201cMommy doesn\u2019t pick you up anymore because she\u2019s an L.A. party girl.\u201d She says sometimes her mom picks Kirra up if she\u2019s away on business, and claims Bohan tries to punish her for working.\n\nThe reality star says she believes her ex has participated in anger management and parenting classes since their split, but claims he hasn\u2019t participated in any individual therapy and therefore believes has not fully addressed his issues.\n\nBecause of the volatility between the two, Patridge says, \u201cI am more afraid of him now than ever, and fear for the safety of our daughter Kirra when she is in his care.\u201d\n\nShe backs up her statement with an example of recklessness, referring to a Snapchat video Bohan posted that appears to show him driving with their daughter in the car while he is filming on his phone. She also says that the video shows the child\u2019s \u201ccar seat is facing the wrong way.\u201d\n\nAs we\u2019ve reported, Patridge filed for divorce from Bohan back in September. At the time, she had also filed for a temporary restraining order after accusing him of pushing her while she was holding their child.\n\nBohan also got into a heated argument with his estranged wife\u2019s father, and it got so bad that the two men almost came to blows. He was later ordered to vacate the house he shared with Patridge, and she got full custody of Kirra, with Bohan getting visitation.\n\nPatridge\u2019s claims and requests will be addressed in court on their next scheduled hearing."}

Google Maps\n\nThe most expensive private home in America will hit the market this spring in Los Angeles for a cool $500 million.\n\nThe Bel Air mansion was designed by Paul McClean, the same architect who built the $88 million estate Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z bought in 2017. McClean's contemporary homes have also sold to the Winklevoss twins, Calvin Klein, and Swedish DJ Avicii.\n\nLos Angeles real estate developer Nile Niami bought the hilltop property in 2012 for $28 million and gutted the original 10,000 square-foot house to make room for the mega-mansion, which he dubbed \"The One,\" according to the New York Times.\n\nAt 100,000 square-feet, the house will also be one of the largest private residences in the US \u2014 but the amenities sound more like a hotel than a home.\n\nWithin floor-to-ceiling glass walls, there's a casino, a jellyfish tank, a beauty salon, a nightclub with VIP seating, plus two indoor swimming pools and two spa pools, and an infinity edge moat surrounding the property.\n\nNiami told the Times he included the Gatsby-like amenities \"because it's cool.\"\n\n\"Let's say you're a super-wealthy single dude who just sold your company. You've just moved to LA and you don't know anybody, so you hire someone to fill your house with partiers,\" Niami told the Times. \"You want everyone to know who you are, but you don't want to talk to anybody. So you go sit in your VIP room.\"\n\nNiami expects the eventual buyer will purchase the mansion as a fifth or sixth home and use it like a private hotel when they're in town. The home has 20 bedrooms, seven of which are in a separate building for staff. The master suite measures 5,500 square feet and includes a separate pool, kitchen, and office.\n\nAlthough McClean is no stranger to designing mansions \u2014 over half of his homes are larger than 8,000 square feet \u2014 \"The One\" was a challenge, he told the Orange County Register.\n\n\"There are very few homes this size,\" McClean said. \"We had to think of it in a different manner than other homes.

Drake would have a big summer, like he has the past few years \u2013 and that also came true, with his various singles from his \u201cScorpion\u201d album ruling the airwaves this summer into fall. And, Kanye West would continue to be unpredictable \u2013 which definitely happened, from his roller coaster of political involvement to his musical output, including his seven-song album \u201cYe\u201d and his surprise hit single \u201cI Love It\u201d with Lil Pump.\n\nIt was the other acts this year that kept things interesting, from surprise rising acts to pop stars that released career-best albums or shone even brighter than we expected.

As it turned out, Cardi fans had nothing to worry about \u2013 the rapper more than exceeded expectations with her stacked debut album \u201cInvasion of Privacy,\u201d which charmed critics and spawned a number of successful singles, including \u201cI Like It,\u201d which racked up the kind of numbers to outperform \u201cBodak Yellow,\u201d a feat that naysayers never would\u2019ve believed last year.\n\nSince the release of \u201cInvasion of Privacy,\u201d she\u2019s remained one of the most visible stars of her genre, contributing one guest feature after another to both hip-hop songs and Spanish-language tracks.

What was surprising were Grande\u2019s creative choices, the most interesting of her career, which she continued to pull off even as she survived yet another incredibly rocky summer. Last year, she persevered after the tragic bombings at her Manchester concert, her struggles of that period helping to inspire the material on \u201cSweetener,\u201d on which she recruited Pharrell Williams to help take her sound in a newer, weirder direction.\n\nThen came this summer\u2019s death of Mac Miller and her breakup with Pete Davidson, which she addressed with her No. 1 single \u201cThank U, Next,\u201d a song that managed to graciously thank her exes and also serve as her public statement of perseverance.

(Photo: Rick Kern, WireImage)\n\nLil Wayne\n\nThe 2018 release of \u201cTha Carter V\u201d, the rapper\u2019s endlessly-delayed fifth album, is surprising enough. Even Wayne\u2019s most die-hard fans have to admit that the rapper hasn\u2019t had the strongest few years of output recently, which along with his various health issues fueled speculation that \u201cTha Carter V\u201d would never see the light of day. But \u201cTha Carter V\u201d didn\u2019t just see an official release date this year but flourished, debuting at No. 1 and winning over skeptical critics who never thought they\u2019d hear Wayne rap at that level again.\n\nThe big talker of the album was \u201cMona Lisa,\u201d a hip-hop opera condensed into a few minutes of music, featuring Kendrick Lamar playing multiple characters and adopting a series of wild voices, with Wayne holding his own through it all.

After a failed audition for \u201cThe X Factor\u201d and an EP that didn\u2019t make waves, Mai began posting clips of her singing to Instagram, where she was discovered by megaproducer DJ Mustard, who signed her to his label and released a series of EPs in 2016 and 2017. Her breakthrough single, \u201cBoo\u2019d Up,\u201d came out in February 2017 but steadily gained traction and finally took hold in early 2018, where it became one the year\u2019s most memorable songs of the summer.

Yet detractors aside, her public statement was the right move for a star who's vocally supported women\u2019s issues and LGBTQ rights, proving that she's willing to work toward advancing those causes by publicly supporting candidates who've backed those policies.\n\nAnd ending her year with news of her new record label deal with Universal Music Group, in which she lobbied for the label's artists to receive fair compensation should UMG sell its Spotify shares, gave Swift fans further faith that their idol is fighting the good fight.\n\nMore: Taylor Swift's political statement is a redeeming moment for the star\n\nRead on: Taylor Swift reveals she signed a new record deal and used it to boost other artists' pay\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/12/24/best-surprises-2018-music-cardi-b-taylor-swift-ariana-grande/2127629002/"}

We're both striving for a different picture,' Vinny explains in a preview clip for Wednesday night's episode.\n\nWhen he first appeared on the show, he wanted the doctors to create him a nose that starts out thick from the nasal bridge and comes down to a point. However, they warned him that what he wanted to achieve was potentially dangerous and wouldn't actually work.\n\nThe surgeons advised him to stick with a more natural-looking nose, and Vinny appreciated their honesty.\n\n'They will definitely say that I have taken more of an extraterrestrial on Earth kind of look \u2014 but always being galaxy realness,' he tells the cameras.\n\nAfter watching Bryan rehearse, they sit down for a chat and Bryan reveals that he and his fianc\u00e9 have set a wedding date, but he's looking to have another surgery before saying 'I do.'\n\nFriends: 'Me and Bryan have a lot in common in terms of him being Britney and me being an alien.

The make-up artist believes he's neither male nor female and so his extreme look is a way to mirror how he feels inside.\n\nVinny started getting cosmetic procedures after feeling like an outcast while growing up. He got lip fillers at the age of 17, before having two rhinoplasties, multiple cheeks and brow bone fillers, and more.\n\nThe part-time model also wears large blackened contact lenses, alien like talons, and dyes his hair bright colors.\n\nLast year he revealed he plant to fork out another $160,000 to have his genitalia, nipples and bellybutton removed.\n\nDedicated: Bryan has spent more than $80,000 on plastic surgery and cosmetic procedures to look like Britney Spears\n\nThrowback: Bryan started emulating the 'Hit Me Baby, One More Time' singing superstar at 17\n\nAll smiles: Bryan pictured with the singer when they met for the first time on vacation in Hawaii\n\n'I want to be a sexless alien being, I want my outside to reflect how I feel on the inside,' he said.

'I could live without sexual organs so why should I have a penis or a vagina? I don't see why I shouldn't have my genitals completely removed and have nothing down there.'\n\nIt's unclear if Vinny ended up going through with the procedure.\n\nLike Vinny, Bryan has also spent thousands of dollars on plastic surgery, shilling out more than $80,000 to look like his idol Britney Spears.\n\nTransformation: He's had more than 90 cosmetic procedures including a nose job, having fat injected into his cheeks, laser hair removal, lip fillers, Botox injections, and more\n\nDedicated: Bryan also splashes out $500 a month on lotions to keep his skin looking youthful\n\nBryan started emulating the 'Hit Me Baby, One More Time' singing superstar at 17, when he had veneers to match her smile.\n\nSince then he's had more than 90 cosmetic procedures including a nose job, having fat injected into his cheeks, laser hair removal, lip fillers, Botox injections, and more.\n\nAs well as cosmetic procedures, he splashes out $500 a month on lotions to keep his skin looking youthful.\n\nOn Wednesday night's episode of Botched, he is looking to get his second rhinoplasty, explaining: 'Now is the perfect time that I get my perfect nose for my dream wedding.'\n\nHowever, its unclear if the doctors will be willing to operate on him.\n\n'Here is the issue, part of your nose will just go psst and collapse in,' Dr. Nassif tells Bryan in another preview clip from the episode."}

This year, we basked in all kinds of greenery, and 2016 found us floating back and forth between the equally dreamy rose quartz and serenity. This year, Pantone suggests a year filled with the rich and regal Ultra Violet.\n\nAccording to Pantone, \u201cUltra Violet suggests the mysteries of the cosmos, the intrigue of what lies ahead, and the discoveries beyond where we are now. The vast and limitless night sky is symbolic of what is possible and continues to inspire the desire to pursue a world beyond our own.\u201d Purple/violet is known to be a spiritual, and religious color, that calms and aids in balancing one\u2019s life and overcoming obstacles. It is also the color of royalty, courage, and justice. In a time where we need courage, leadership, and the ability to overcome obstacles, this color proves to be right on point.\n\nPantone also points out that the color \u201csymbolizes experimentation and non-conformity, spurring individuals to imagine their unique mark on the world, and push boundaries through creative outlets.\u201d This beautiful shade of purple is also a reminder of great musicians. Selena, Prince, Jimi Hendrix, and David Bowie all used the color as part of their image.\n\nFortunately, this fierce color is not reserved for musical geniuses. Ultra Violet is a fun color you can wear right now. It is a jewel-toned pop of color that will jazz up any neutrals in your wardrobe, and a nice fall-and-winter-friendly choice when you want to try something outside of burgundy, navy, dark green, or other such seasonal colors. If you\u2019re feeling bold, mix this color with other brights, like teal, cobalt blue, or yellow (purple and yellow are complimentary colors on the color wheel). For makeup, purple is a universally-flattering eye color; it also looks great as a bold matte lip, or a berry-hued manicure.\n\nPhoto: FashionLady\n\nReady to take the plunge into Pantone\u2019s Color of the Year? We compiled a list of some places where you can get in on the Ultra Violet craze early on.\n\nYour nails, of course."}
{"label": true, "txt": "5 steps to achieving your New Year's resolutions\n\nI'm a big fan of New Year's resolutions. \"New Year's resolutions\" are yearly goals that you set for yourself at the beginning of a new year. They usually have to do with fitness, saving money, education, etc.\n\nPeople often make New Year's resoltions at the beginning of the year but don't end up keeping them. That used to happen to me too. Then one year I got serious about my resolutions and started using some of the techniques that I'm going to describe below. I ended up achieving all of my New Year's resolutions that year, and it felt great!\n\nSo here are some techniques to help you become a super resolution achiever:\n\n1. Only pick three goals\n\nYou should have one really important goal that you're going to achieve no matter what. You can set two other goals to work toward as well. Just remember to decide which goal is your \"main\" one.\n\nWhy am I being so restrictive? Because if you try to do more than three things at once, you'll get lost. You'll lost track of what's most important. You'll start to neglect one of your goals, and then you'll feel guilty about it. Soon you'll start to lose confidence in yourself.\n\nSo stick with one main resolution and two secondary ones.\n\n2. Write your resolutions down and post them somewhere\n\nThink of a single word to represent each of your resolutions. Write the word in big letters and post it somewhere in your home.\n\nFor example, if you want to lose weight, you can make a sign with the word \"thin\". Hang it on your refrigerator, so that every time you get food you'll be reminded of your resolution.\n\nDon't just write your resolutions down quietly, though. Announce them to your family and friends. Put them on your Facebook page. Make copies of your resolution to hang in your office. The more reminders, the better.\n\n3. Turn each resolution into a habit\n\nNow that you've chosen a goal, find something that you can do every day to work toward it. Working on your resolutions every single day is very, very effective.\n\nFor example, that's how I started PhraseMix: I made a rule for myself that I had to write a lesson every day before I went to sleep. I've missed a few days in the last two years, but mostly I've stuck with it.\n\nIf you do something every day, it becomes a habit. Soon you won't even think about it; you'll just do it naturally, like brushing your teeth.\n\n4. Work on one habit per month\n\nTo achieve an important goal, you'll probably need to pick up several good habits. For example, to get in shape you'll need to exercise, cut down on your drinking, eat more vegetables, and so on.\n\nIf you try to pick up a lot of good habits at once, you're probably going to fail. It's just too hard to focus.\n\nInstead, I suggest focusing on one good habit per month. After you've gotten used to the first one, you can then add the next one, and so on. For example, if you want to save more money this year, you can add habits like this:\n\nJanuary: Write down your expenses each day\n\nFebruary: Make your own lunch each day\n\nMarch: Sell one used item from your home each day on the Internet\n\n...and so on.\n\n5. Use a calendar\n\nA few years ago, I heard about the Jerry Seinfeld calendar technique.\n\nThe way it works is simple: get a calendar to put on the wall. Every day that you keep up your good habits, mark the day with an \"X\" on the calendar. Then try not to miss any days.\n\nSeeing all of the hard work marked on the calendar will motivate you to continue working hard every day.\n\nTo help get you started, I've put together a blank calendar that you can print out and use:\n\nReview\n\nTo review, here's how you can make New Year's resolutions this year and really keep them:\n\nPick one main resolution and one or two secondary ones.\n\nWrite your resolutions down and post them in easy-to-see places.\n\nFind a way to work on your resolutions every day.\n\nStart just one new habit per month.\n\nKeep track of your progress on a calendar.\n\nSo what are your resolutions going to be? Something related to your English studies? What are you going to do each day to achieve your goals?"}

{"label": true, "txt": "Image zoom Getty Images\n\nIt's easy to wax poetic over the benefits of a gel manicure\u2014two weeks of chip-free wear and glossy shine? Yes, please! Removing the LED-cured lacquer, however, is another story. Once the free edge around the cuticle starts to lift, it takes all of our self-control trying (and sometimes failing...) not to rip all ten shells from our digits, which can cause major damage to the natural nail bed underneath.\n\nWhether you're wearing a gel manicure from the salon or your own handiwork, we rounded up three foolproof DIY ways to remove the product. No matter the method you choose, make sure you shield the skin around the nail with a preventative layer of Vaseline, as each involves acetone. Follow your technique of choice with an ample amount of cuticle oil or cream, like Lush's Lemony Flutter ($20; lushusa.com) afterward to restore moisture, and if you must re-shellac your nails, give them a few hours to breathe before applying another layer.\n\nVIDEO: How to Properly Remove Your Gel Manicure\n\nGRAB A KIT\n\nRemoval kits like Red Carpet Manicure's ($13; amazon.com) and Nails Inc.'s Gel-Less Gel Nail Polish Remover Kit ($19; sephora.com) come equipped with everything you need to strip the shellac from your nails. Both work on salon-cured and DIY jobs, but differ only in the type of soaking pads involved. Red Carpet Manicure's kit includes ten foils with each piece affixed to the nail surface, while Ciate's comes equipped with conditioning acetone and a gel remover pot in which you pour the solution and dip your hand in one at time to loosen up the gel polish.\n\nRELATED: '90s Babies Rejoice! Hard Candy is Relaunching Their Classic Nail Polishes\n\nDIY FOILS\n\nIf a gel manicure is a frequent treatment for you, this method might be best, as some of the kits may not include enough solution for regular removals. Pick up a bottle of acetone like Beauty Secrets' formula ($3; sallybeauty.com), ten cotton balls, and a roll of tin foil from the kitchen. Buff the surface of your mani with a nail file to remove the shine, then soak a cotton ball in the acetone and place it directly on top of your nail. Follow by wrapping each finger with a small piece of foil, and after 10 to 15 minutes, the gel manicure should slide right off with the cotton ball. If some residue remains stuck to your nail, use an orange wood stick to work it off.\n\nRELATED: Step Away From the Rhinestones! Minimalist Manicures Are Having a Moment at #NYFW\n\nTHE SOAKING METHOD\n\nThis method takes the longest and requires a little elbow grease, but works wonders if you don't have any foil or cotton balls on hand. Grab two bowls from the kitchen, one slightly larger than the other. Fill the larger bowl with warm water, place the smaller one inside (as you would with a double-boiler), and pour in some acetone. Because acetone is highly-flammable, you should not heat it in the microwave or stove. As you allow the solution to warm for a minute or two, buff the surfaces of your manicure with a nail file, then place your hand inside the acetone and allow the gels to gradually soak off. After 10 to 15 minutes, you should notice the corners coming loose. As your nails are steeping in the acetone, take an orange wood stick and gently begin to loosen the gel on each nail until it is removed completely. Repeat on the other hand, and top off with a generous amount of hand cream and cuticle oil."}
{"label": true, "txt": "The Paley Center for Media paid tribute to the actor Thursday at the Paley Honors.\n\nOn Thursday, The Paley Center for Media honored Alec Baldwin for his distinguished career and supportive efforts for the organization\u2019s educational initiatives. The event included a discussion with The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon announcer and Saturday Night Live writer-producer Steve Higgins.\n\nBaldwin made a point to discuss the current sexual misconduct allegations circulating in Hollywood. The actor admitted that he has been guilty of treating women poorly in the past. \u201cI certainly have treated women in a very sexist way. I\u2019ve bullied women. I\u2019ve overlooked women. I\u2019ve underestimated women. Not as a rule,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom time to time, I\u2019ve done what a lot of men do, which is \u2026 when you don\u2019t treat women the same way you treat men. You don\u2019t. I\u2019m from a generation where you really don\u2019t and I\u2019d like that to change. I really would like that to change.\u201d\n\nThe Emmy Award-winning actor said that the way individuals function in the workplace needs to change, not just in Hollywood but everywhere. \u201cI think it\u2019s important for us to try to make the workplace and beyond not only comfortable and right and fair and appropriate but as productive, as well. I think a lot of what we\u2019re dealing with within this issue is hurting our business. It\u2019s making it less productive,\" Baldwin asserted.\n\n\u201cI knew of certain things, that there were rumors of things happening to people, but I didn\u2019t necessarily know the scope, when you hear the hundreds and hundreds of women who are complaining about this,\u201d the actor admitted while accepting the honor. \u201cIt\u2019s been a very eye-opening experience for me personally. We\u2019ve got to be vigilant in a new way to make sure that everybody is comfortable and that we get the job done together that we\u2019re there to do.\u201d\n\nDuring the conversation, Baldwin and Higgins discussed some of the actor\u2019s career highlights, including his famous impression of Donald Trump on NBC's Saturday Night Live. When Higgins asked if Baldwin jumped at the opportunity to play the public figure turned president, he joked, \u201cI was so there. I was like, \u2018Oh, God, I hope that Lorne [Michaels] calls me.'\u201d Baldwin admitted that he initially had no clue how in-demand the character would become. \u201cI lived in a world where it was presumed he wasn\u2019t gonna win,\u201d he said. Because of this, Baldwin thought he was only committed to play the character for three episodes on the late-night sketch show.\n\nBaldwin mentioned that he had only known Trump in passing prior to his portrayal. \u201cHe was always kind of a drive-by presence in Manhattan,\u201d he said. While the two had attended the same events, Baldwin explained that Trump would often show up for the red-carpet photo opportunities and then leave before the socializing began. \u201cIt would have been nice to sit through dinner, just out of curiosity, with Trump and say, \u2018Tell me what it was like growing up there in Jackson Heights, or wherever you\u2019re from,\u2019\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cYou never got to talk to him. You never met him. He was a cypher.\u201d\n\nBaldwin said his lack of personal interactions with Trump didn\u2019t leave him with much material to draw from when creating the character. \u201cSo when you come in to do the show, you just have him in the media. Although he\u2019s pretty vivid in the media. He seems like himself,\u201d the actor said on his inspiration for the impersonation. \u201cI just wanted to make him as miserable as possible. He wins the election and he\u2019s like, \u2018God damn you people,\u2019\u201d Baldwin said in his best Trump impression.\n\nAnother character Baldwin reflected on was that of Jack Donaghy of NBC\u2019s critically acclaimed sitcom 30 Rock. \u201cI got very lucky,\u201d he said. The show never garnered impressive ratings, but managed to be a critical success. Baldwin won seven SAG Awards and two Emmy Awards for the role. \u201cWe were very lucky that the show was a critical darling,\" he said.\n\n\u201cWe started in 2006. The [financial] crash came in 2008. It was very disruptive of the broadcast TV business and their ad rates and so forth,\u201d recalled Baldwin. His theory regarding 30 Rock\u2019s success was that is remained on the air as long as it did because most of its audience was in the entertainment industry. \u201cPeople in the business watch the show. It\u2019s not like other shows, which are huge hits but they might not be darlings in the industry.\u201d\n\nBaldwin also added that while he has acted in both dramas and comedies, he tends to choose his projects based on the material instead of the genre. \u201cI love doing dramas if the material is worthwhile, but then I did the TV show with [30 Rock creator and star] Tina [Fey],\u201d he said. \u201cThe writing is essential, and the writing was so good.\u201d"}

We stand by the meticulous reporting of Ms. Orth.\u201d\n\nIn Murphy's follow-up cycle to The People v. O.J. Simpson, Edgar Ramirez stars as Versace, while Penelope Cruz stars as his sister Donatella, Ricky Martin plays his longtime partner Antonio D'Amico and Darren Criss stars as Cunanan.\n\nMurphy himself told The Hollywood Reporter that Donatella Versace's actions seemed to indicate she wasn't entirely displeased with the drama. \"Donatella Versace sent Penelope Cruz a very large arrangement of flowers when she was representing the show at the Golden Globes,\" he said. \"I don't know if she is going to watch the show, but if she did, I think she would see that we treat her and her family with respect and kindness, and she really is sort of a feminist role model in my book because she had to step into an impossible situation, which she did with grace and understanding.\"\n\nUltimately, Murphy said he understands the instinct to be wary of the project but added that Cruz \"would never do anything to represent [Donatella] in a negative light.\"\n\nThe Versace family has noted that it will issue no further comment on the show.\n\nRead the family's statement in full below:\n\nAs we have said, the Versace family has neither authorized nor had any involvement whatsoever in the forthcoming TV series about the death of Mr. Gianni Versace, which should only be considered as a work of fiction.\n\nThe company producing the series claims it is relying on a book by Maureen Orth, but the Orth book itself is full of gossip and speculation. Orth never received any information from the Versace family and she has no basis to make claims about the intimate personal life of Gianni Versace or other family members. Instead, in her effort to create a sensational story, she presents second-hand hearsay that is full of contradictions.\n\nAs just one example, Orth makes assertions about Gianni Versace\u2019s medical condition based on a person who claims he reviewed a post-mortem test result, but she admits it would have been illegal for the person to have reviewed the report in the first place (if it existed at all). In making her lurid claims, she ignores contrary information provided by members of Mr. Versace\u2019s family, who lived and worked closely with him and were in the best position to know the facts of his life.\n\nGianni Versace was a brave and honest man, who engaged in humanitarian work for the benefit of others. Of all the possible portrayals of his life and legacy, it is sad and reprehensible that the producers have chosen to present the distorted and bogus version created by Maureen Orth.\n\nThe Versace family will issue no further comment on the matter.\n\n\n\nUPDATE: On Thursday, Random House (publisher of source material Vulgar Favors by journalist Maureen Orth, issued its own statement on the matter: \u201cFirst published almost 19 years ago, Vulgar Favors is a carefully reported and extensively-sourced work of investigative journalism by an award-winning journalist with impeccable credentials.

{"label": true, "txt": "First episode is wonderful, and features Edgar Ramirez as Gianni Versace. You can't take your eyes off this actor. Although all the acting is fine, when \"Versace\" (Ramirez) is on the screen, he's the one you look at.

Located in Florida, it's a rare look into the living style of someone with consummate taste and the money to express it. What a man. What a house.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the rest of the series (so far, only 6 have aired, out of 9) doesn't live up to the first episode, even though Darren Criss's nuanced performance as Andrew Cunanan, the assassin who shot down Versace, is excellent, as are performances of the other actors, particularly that by Penelope Cruz as Gianni's sister, Donatella. Ricky Martin turns in a good job as Gianni's longtime companion Antonio D'Amico.\n\n\n\nSerial killer Cunanan's story is told in flashbacks.\n\n\n\nThis drama is based on a true story, which makes it all the more interesting, but it's Edgar Ramirez' presence that keeps me coming back, hoping for more."}
{"label": true, "txt": "Academy Award winner George Clooney, who was given his first major big-screen role by Harvey Weinstein, has become the latest\u2014and most high-profile\u2014member of Hollywood to speak out on the alleged sexual-misconduct allegations against his sometime employer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s indefensible. That\u2019s the only word you can start with,\u201d he says. \u201cHarvey\u2019s admitted to it, and it\u2019s indefensible. I\u2019ve known Harvey for 20 years. He gave me my first big break as an actor in films on From Dusk Till Dawn, he gave me my first big break as a director with Confessions of a Dangerous Mind. We\u2019ve had dinners, we\u2019ve been on location together, we\u2019ve had arguments. But I can tell you that I\u2019ve never seen any of this behavior\u2014ever.\u201d\n\nClooney spoke to me at length about the allegations\u2014as well as charges of Hollywood complicity\u2014during a phone conversation late Monday.\n\nHis remarks come in the wake of statements released by Meryl Streep and Dame Judi Dench, two actresses who\u2019ve won Oscars for Weinstein-shepherded films and who took the bullying movie mogul to task for allegedly preying on vulnerable young women for 30 years, resulting in at least eight settlements, according to a bombshell New York Times expos\u00e9.\n\nWeinstein\u2019s accusers, among them the actress Ashley Judd, shared similar horror stories: a \u201cbusiness meeting\u201d at a lavish hotel suite soon gave way to a series of sexual propositions, including watching him shower. One local TV reporter, Lauren Sivan, claimed that Weinstein cornered her in the bowels of his restaurant, told her to \u201cbe quiet,\u201d and masturbated into a potted plant.\n\nWeinstein, the former co-chief of Miramax, has since been fired from The Weinstein Company\u2014which he co-founded with his brother Bob\u2014and many of the male actors and filmmakers in particular who have benefited from the studio executive\u2019s Oscar Midas touch, from Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (Good Will Hunting) to Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction), have remained alarmingly silent.\n\nClooney, on the other hand, was anything but.\n\nHow did you react to the Harvey Weinstein news?\n\nI\u2019ve heard rumors, and the rumors in general started back in the \u201990s, and they were that certain actresses had slept with Harvey to get a role. It seemed like a way to smear the actresses and demean them by saying that they didn\u2019t get the jobs based on their talent, so I took those rumors with a grain of salt. But the other part of this, the part we\u2019re hearing now about eight women being paid off, I didn\u2019t hear anything about that and I don\u2019t know anyone that did. That\u2019s a whole other level and there\u2019s no way you can reconcile that. There\u2019s nothing to say except that it\u2019s indefensible.\n\nThe thing I\u2019ve been seeing online is that, in the wake of Meryl Streep\u2019s statement, and knowing that he helped guide her to an Oscar for The Iron Lady, many people are saying, \u201cOh, she had to know.\u201d But that seems both incredibly speculative and unfair.\n\nA lot of people are doing the \u201cyou had to know\u201d thing right now, and yes, if you\u2019re asking if I knew that someone who was very powerful had a tendency to hit on young, beautiful women, sure. But I had no idea that it had gone to the level of having to pay off eight women for their silence, and that these women were threatened and victimized. I\u2019ve been talking with a lot of people about this, and I don\u2019t know many people who knew of that.\n\nSharon Waxman over at The Wrap said she was working on a story about Harvey over 10 years ago at The New York Times and they killed it, and if that\u2019s true, then that\u2019s a shameful thing because a lot of women wouldn\u2019t have been made victims if this had come out. By the same token, I do want to say that Sharon\u2019s been running her own influential website, The Wrap, for quite a long time, and if she did these interviews and this investigation, she didn\u2019t run the story either, and I and a lot of other people would have liked to have known it. A good bunch of people that I know would say, \u201cYeah, Harvey\u2019s a dog\u201d or \u201cHarvey\u2019s chasing girls,\u201d but again, this is a very different kind of thing. This is harassment on a very high level. And there\u2019s an argument that everyone is complicit in it. I suppose the argument would be that it\u2019s not just about Hollywood, but about all of us\u2014that every time you see someone using their power and influence to take advantage of someone without power and influence and you don\u2019t speak up, you\u2019re complicit. And there\u2019s no question about that.\n\nHollywood can be good when it comes to certain progressive causes, but this area\u2014preying on women\u2014seems to be a pretty major blind spot. The \u201ccasting couch\u201d and the \u201ccreepy, lecherous producer,\u201d these are concepts that are so firmly ingrained in the industry that they\u2019ve become troubling clich\u00e9s, and go all the way back to Golden Age studio chiefs like Louis B. Mayer and David O. Selznick.\n\nI hear you. At the same time, I know an awful lot more people in this business who have nothing to do with that, and I suppose if I went looking I could probably find three or four names of people that I would suspect of doing that. The other part of it is, I\u2019d like to think that if someone came up to me and told me this was going on that I would go out and confront it. I\u2019ve told this story about a night with Silvio Berlusconi, and I hadn\u2019t told all the specifics about it before, but perhaps I should have been more graphic about how vulgar that was in a way to take some responsibility\u2014each of us, in our own individual way\u2014of talking about people with a lot of power using it and holding it over others in some ways.\n\nBut on the other hand, maybe that\u2019s what good will come out of this: that not just in Hollywood, although Hollywood is now the focus, but in all of these cases the victims will feel that they will be listened to, and that they don\u2019t need to be afraid.\n\nThis is an interesting moment. I\u2019ve seen a lot of people, from Meryl [Streep] to Judi Dench, come out and say \u201choly shit,\u201d and I think that that\u2019s been the reaction by a lot of people in Hollywood. I don\u2019t think that people were looking the other way; I think that people weren\u2019t looking, because in some ways, a lecherous guy with money picking up younger girls is unfortunately not a news story in our society.\n\nSo when you find out how much worse it is than you thought, then it\u2019s a news story. And this is a big news story now. And I feel very bad for all of the victims. I mean, cornering a young anchorwoman in the kitchen and jerking off into a potted plant? That\u2019s not just some rumor about Harvey hitting on a woman; it\u2019s disturbing on a whole lot of levels, because there had to be a lot of people involved in covering that up. That\u2019s frustrating. If politicians knew these stories, I doubt they\u2019d have been taking donations from him at the DNC [Democratic National Committee], and I hope that they will all give the money back or donate it to good causes.\n\nThose on the right, from Fox News to Donald Trump Jr., have used the Harvey Weinstein news as a cudgel against liberals. It\u2019s a bit rich on Trump Jr.\u2019s part, given the numerous allegations against his father.\n\nYeah, that\u2019s a little pot and kettle there, unfortunately. But I think that everything gets politicized these days. The reality is that this is a problem deeply ingrained in our society. It was something that was talked about a lot on the left with Roger Ailes, Bill O\u2019Reilly, and Donald Trump, and it\u2019s something that\u2019s going to be talked about a lot on the right with Harvey Weinstein. I think that rather than politicize it, there should be talk on both sides about the really bad behavior by powerful men and the horrible acts they commit. It\u2019s pretty crazy to me.\n\nIt is so firmly ingrained in the culture now. We just elected a man president who\u2019s been accused of sexual misconduct by over a dozen women and was caught on tape bragging to a relative stranger about his ability to sexually assault women at will. One of the strange things about the Harvey news is it emerged around the one-year anniversary of that Trump Access Hollywood tape.\n\nThat is a funny part of it: In \u201cliberal\u201d Hollywood the guy loses his job, but then this other guy [Trump] gets elected president. There are a couple of good things that have to come out of this, because something good has to come out of this. One of those things is that victims have to feel safer to come out and tell their stories without the fear of losing their jobs, and they also need to be believed, which is a very important element of this. Also, this should be a shot across the bow that people in places of power cannot abuse that power, and if you do, you\u2019ll be outed publicly, shamed, and even prosecuted. When it comes to most of the people that I know, where we\u2019re shocked is by how bad it was. This is about show business but it isn\u2019t just about show business\u2014it\u2019s about everything. We need to get to a place where we can call these people out much quicker before it becomes such a deeper, long-running problem. This apparently went on for almost 30 years.\n\nPeople did know that Harvey was a terrible bully, though. It was interesting how Hollywood approached it, because he was almost treated like a caricature\u2014the angry, bellowing studio mogul. I remember there was a character on Entourage based on him. It was treated almost like a joke.\n\nThink about it this way, too: I had knock-down, drag-out fights with him over the years, but he was also making films that other studios weren\u2019t willing to make, and he was making films that everybody loved, so you just put up with certain bad behavior because you felt like, well, if he yells and screams but he gets Pulp Fiction made, who cares if he yells and screams? But it\u2019s a very different conversation when you say, it\u2019s not that he yells and screams but that he\u2019s cornering a young, scared lady in a restaurant and telling her to stand there and be quiet while he jerks off. That\u2019s a very different kind of behavior, and had that been a public thing, I think there would have been some different results. I hope there would be.\n\nWhy do you think people are holding him accountable now? I wrote a piece about how there seems to be a lot more accountability surrounding issues of sexual assault and misconduct in Hollywood, and that it\u2019s perhaps a reaction to the Cosby revelations, which served as a wake-up call for a lot of people in the entertainment media space\u2014that in covering celebrities you can\u2019t gloss over the dark details, otherwise you\u2019re mildly complicit. Also, it\u2019s so important how there are more women now in both Hollywood and newsrooms who feel empowered to speak up and hold those in power accountable.\n\nHopefully, this kind of behavior will end\u2014or become harder and harder for it to continue. What\u2019s important now is that anybody who thinks that they can get away with doing that, they now have to think: Wait, somebody can be recording this or writing a story about it. I\u2019m going to get in a lot of trouble. That\u2019s good, because we\u2019ve seen this type of behavior in politics, in Silicon Valley, and in corporate America. This is a big problem in our society, that people in power are taking advantage of people not in power\u2014particularly powerful men with young women. Maybe Cosby was the watershed moment. I think Roger Ailes was also a watershed moment, because it concerned an establishment figure up to some very shady stuff. But this isn\u2019t a right or a left issue; this is a moral issue. We\u2019re all going to have to be more diligent about it and look for any warning signs. Before, people weren\u2019t paying enough attention to it. Now we have to. This is the moment to start scaring people like this into not acting this way anymore."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Photo: Getty If you\u2019ve set foot in Sephora, a drugstore or anywhere near a cosmetics counter lately, chances are you\u2019ve been bombarded by a bewildering array of flesh colored fluids. The alphabet formulations--like BB cream, CC cream, and soon DD creams--have joined tinted moisturizers and standard foundation on the shelves as potential skin-perfecting options. But what do they all (supposedly) do? What's the difference between them? And most importantly: Which should you use? We break it down for you. Related Articles Korean Skincare: The Difference Between Serums, Essences & Ampoules The Comprehensive List of Where You Can Return Opened Beauty Products How to Find the Most Flattering Nude Lipstick for Your Skin Tone Tinted Moisturizer: The name is pretty self explanatory: The product gives you a bit of color with a moisturizing benefit--the color is usually pretty sheer. My sense is that they may be headed for extinction, or at least hibernation. While tinted moisturizers are still on the market and probably still have many fans, I haven\u2019t seen a new launch for one in quite a while--alphabet creams are all the rage now. ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website ADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website\n\nEditors' Pick: NARS Pure Radiant Tinted Moisturizer, $45, available here. BB Creams: BB creams are an Asian import that have become super popular in the last two years here in the US. BB creams provide coverage with added skin care benefits like SPF and anti-oxidants--the list goes on depending on what brand you choose. They're lighter than foundation but heavier than tinted moisturizers. While the additives in BB creams can have the same efficacy as they would in stand-alone serums, be careful about counting on BB creams for adequate sun protection. \"My only concern is that since BB cream is generally tinted, women use less on their face,\" Manhattan dermatologist Dr. Heidi Waldorf said. Meaning you won't slather it on the way you do--or should--with a more traditional sunscreen, resulting in inadequate protection.\n\nEditors' Pick: Bobbi Brown BB Cream SPF 35, $46, available here. CC Creams: The difference between BB and CC creams is subtle--CC generally stands for \u201ccolor correcting\u201d and the products are meant to address issues like redness or sallowness (usually with light-diffusing particles), whereas BB creams are like lighter foundation with a few skin care benefits thrown in. \u201cCC cream is a color corrector and will be lighter on the skin [than a BB cream],\u201d celeb makeup artist Nico Guilis told us. \u201cThey have more of a whipped, light, fluffy feel and finish--kind of the new and improved BB.\u201d While BB and CC creams are marketed for separate issues, and are theoretically different, I've tried many BBs and a few CC creams--and honestly, they're almost the same. Where it gets most confusing here is that BB/CC benefits and coverage vary greatly among different brands. For example, Clinique's CC cream is definitely more opaque than some BB creams I've tried from other brands. So go figure. You have to be diligent in reading ingredients and most importantly, trying them out (like we did) to figure out what you want and need. (Allure has a great list here detailing which BB/CC brands are best for which type of skin issues).\n\nEditors' Pick: Clinique Moisture Surge CC Cream Hydrating Colour Corrector Broad Spectrum SPF 30, $39, available here. DD Creams: And now get ready for DD creams (sigh). Julep is releasing what it's calling a \"Dynamic Do-All\" cream this summer, and it kinda sounds like a BB/CC hybrid. Weirdly, the cosmetics industry was predicting something completely different for DD creams. Back in November of 2012, a cosmetics industry analyst told Cosmetic Design (a trade website) that a number of DD creams, called \"Daily Defense\" creams were poised to launch, but they aren't for your face--rather they are \"heavy duty body and foot creams.\" So it will be interesting to see if Julep single-handedly just changed that category with its forthcoming launch."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Olaf's Frozen Adventure is a 2017 American 3D computer-animated featurette, produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It is directed by Kevin Deters and Stevie Wermers, who previously directed the holiday-themed Prep and Landing shorts. The film features the voices of Josh Gad, Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, and Jonathan Groff reprising their roles from the original 2013 film Frozen. It premiered in 3D in theaters for a limited time engagement[5] in front of Pixar's Coco on November 22, 2017, and made its television debut on ABC on December 14, 2017.[6]\n\nPlot [ edit ]\n\nIt is the first Christmas season since the gates reopened and Anna and Elsa host a celebration for all of Arendelle. When the townspeople unexpectedly leave early to enjoy their individual holiday customs, the sisters realize they have no family traditions of their own. Elsa laments the fact that because she had isolated herself most of her life, she and Anna were unable to spend time with each other. Olaf decides to look for traditions with Sven's help.\n\nGoing through the town, Olaf encounters various family traditions relating to Christmas, Hanukkah and Winter solstice. After a visit to Oaken, Olaf, Sven and their sleigh full of traditions travel through the snowy tundra only for a coal (from a portable sauna that Oaken had given them) to set the sleigh on fire. They slide down a hill and Olaf and Sven end up separated by a chasm. With only a fruit cake, Olaf attempts to travel through the woods and is attacked by wolves.\n\nMeanwhile, Anna and Elsa discover some forgotten items in their attic where they find things from their past. Sven returns to Kristoff and informs him (in vain), Anna, and Elsa of Olaf's plight. They gather the residents of Arendelle to go look for Olaf. Elsewhere, Olaf manages to escape the wolves, but loses the fruit cake to a hawk and gives up by a tree not too far from the kingdom. Anna and Elsa find Olaf and cheer him up by revealing that they do have a tradition: Himself. After Elsa had shut herself away, Anna began annually sliding cards and dolls of Olaf under her door. As they all celebrate the holidays, the hawk drops the fruit cake on Olaf. Upon getting the fruit cake back, Olaf declares it \"A Christmas miracle!\"\n\nCast [ edit ]\n\nProduction [ edit ]\n\nOn February 9, 2016, the short film was announced as a television special, to be aired on ABC,[7] produced by Roy Conli, and directed by Kevin Deters and Stevie Wermers. The title was revealed during the airing of The Making of Frozen: Return to Arendelle on ABC in 2016, and it was announced that it would feature original songs by Elyssa Samsel and Kate Anderson, the sister of Frozen songwriter Kristen Anderson-Lopez. However, in June 2017, it was announced that the film would instead receive a limited time[5] theatrical release in front of Disney\u00b7Pixar's Coco, as it was deemed too cinematic for television. The main original cast, Josh Gad, Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, and Jonathan Groff, returned, and the story follows Olaf as he tries to find the best holiday traditions for Anna, Elsa, and Kristoff.[3][8]\n\nThe music was recorded by an 80-piece orchestra in May 2017. The short was the filmmakers' first musical. They noted the requirement to keep the plot \"pretty simple\", and commented that they removed anything that diverted too much from that story. The fruitcake jokes in the short are a continuing motif from the filmmakers' previous project Prep & Landing. As they crafted the story, the Frozen team had barely started sketching out the plot of Frozen 2.[9]\n\nSoundtrack [ edit ]\n\nThere are four original songs in the film, written by Elyssa Samsel and Kate Anderson, titled \"Ring in the Season\", \"The Ballad of Flemmingrad\", \"That Time of Year\" and \"When We're Together\". Film's score has been composed by Christophe Beck and Jeff Morrow. The full soundtrack was released on November 3, 2017 by Walt Disney Records.[10][11]\n\nOriginal Motion Picture Soundtrack No. Title Performer(s) Length 1. \"Ring in the Season\" Kristen Bell\n\nIdina Menzel\n\nJosh Gad 1:58 2. \"The Ballad of Flemmingrad\" Jonathan Groff 0:44 3. \"Ring in the Season\" (Reprise) Idina Menzel 1:16 4. \"That Time of Year\" Josh Gad\n\nIdina Menzel\n\nKristen Bell\n\nCast 3:03 5. \"That Time of Year\" (Reprise) Josh Gad 0:52 6. \"When We're Together\" Idina Menzel\n\nKristen Bell\n\nJosh Gad\n\nJonathan Groff 2:50 7. \"Olaf's Frozen Adventure\" (Score Suite) Christophe Beck\n\nJeff Morrow 4:27 8. \"The Ballad of Flemmingrad\" (Traditional Version) Groff 3:06 9. \"Ring in the Season\" (Instrumental Karaoke Mix) Elyssa Samsel\n\nKate Anderson 1:58 10. \"That Time of Year\" (Instrumental Karaoke Mix) Samsel\n\nAnderson 3:02 11. \"When We're Together\" (Instrumental Karaoke Mix) Samsel\n\nAnderson 2:49 Total length: 25:40\n\nRelease [ edit ]\n\nOlaf's Frozen Adventure was released by Walt Disney Pictures in 3D in theaters as a limited time offering[5] on November 22, 2017, preceding screenings of Pixar's Coco.[3][8] In the UK, it was shown before re-releases of Frozen on November 25 and 26, and December 2 and 3, 2017. On November 23, Disney announced the release of Olaf's Frozen Adventure on Disney's cable television channels in Latin America, along with Netflix, on December 8, and later on Mexican channels Azteca 7 and 13.[12] Coco co-director Adrian Molina said that the short's placement before Coco was an \"experiment\" due to its length.[13] It ended its limited run in US screenings on December 8.[14] Due to its brevity, the film was released as a matinee in Gibraltar, after which the 2013 film Frozen was also shown.[15]\n\nReception as pre-Coco short [ edit ]\n\nThe week after Coco's release in Mexico, local media noted audiences' strong dislike for the length of the short film.[16][17][18][19] A few days later, all Mexican cinemas offered apologies, and removed the short from exhibition.[20][21] American audiences had a similar reaction.[22] It was reported that some theaters put warning signs up about the length of the Frozen short ahead of Coco.[23] The Disney Movies Review felt that the choice to put a franchise-expander in the short film slot prevented a Pixar animator from sharing their unique cultural and creative voice.[24] The Washington Post argued that the \"emotionally complex work,\" of Pixar becomes jarring when paired with the \"truly silly jokes and big, showy production numbers\" of the short film.[25] Mashable's review focused on the placement of the short before Coco, and deemed it a \"horrendous waste of time\".[26]\n\nReception as TV special [ edit ]\n\nThe short made its television debut on ABC on December 14, 2017, as part of 25 Days of Christmas.[27] It was viewed by 5.64 million viewers.[28] Reviewers began to review the film as a television special rather than a pre-Coco short and had a favorable reception to it as part of the Frozen franchise. Simon Boyle of The Sun wrote that the short film \"doesn't disappoint\", adding it \"provides a perfect bridge to the hotly anticipated full sequel\".[29] Indiwire deemed the short a \"bridge\" and a \"setup\" to Frozen 2,[30] while The Mirror felt it would \"tide fans over\" until the next feature length installment of the franchise.[31] Meanwhile, KSDK thought it was \"an 'Adventure' worth taking,\"[32] and Slashfilm wrote that \"When We're Together\" had the potential to be 2017's version of \"Let It Go\".[33] Slate noted the short film's overt commercialism, and also thought it committed the well-trodden sin of turning a comedic side-character into the star, describing it as an \"increasingly desperate one-man show\". However, the reviewer felt ultimately won over by the music, animation, and heartwarming conclusion.[34]\n\nAccolades [ edit ]\n\nYear Award Category Recipient(s) and nominee(s) Result Ref. 2018 Annie Award Best Animated Special Production Olaf's Frozen Adventure Nominated [35] Animated Effects in an Animated Production Christopher Hendryx, Dan Lund, Mike Navarro, Hiroaki Narita, Steven Chitwood Nominated Music in an Animated Feature Production Elyssa Samsel, Kate Anderson, Christophe Beck Nominated\n\nHome media [ edit ]\n\nThe film was made available in the digital format on December 19, 2017,[36][37] while in the UK it was released as a Tesco-exclusive DVD on December 7, 2017.[38] The DVD and Blu-ray was released on November 13, 2018 in the US and Canada.[39]"}

He wasn\u2019t. The viewers may think he was, but he wasn\u2019t,\u201d Vicki explained to E! News. \u201cDid he turn into a monster towards the end? He did a lot of weird ass crazy things that I still don\u2019t understand because I don\u2019t talk to him.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI don\u2019t know why he did what he did, but he wasn\u2019t a monster. He wasn\u2019t really the man I thought he was if he did what he did to me.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Vicki says if she could talk to Brooks one on one she\u2019d ask him one question: why?\n\n\u201cWhy did you reveal bad records? Why did you do what you did to me?\u201d Vicki explained. \u201cWe had a good thing going, or so I thought, but why? I still don\u2019t know why. I\u2019ve never been able to get the answer from him.\u201d\n\nIf you don\u2019t remember Brooks faked cancer and showed off fake cancer documents to the media and Vicki\u2019s RHOC co-stars in hopes of shutting down doubts about his health.\n\nUltimately, it was revealed that Brooks never had cancer and was never treated by City of Hope Medical Center.\n\nAnd to make matters worse, Vicki called her relationship with Brooks \u201cgreat\u201d in the RHOC season 12 premiere. Gag!\n\nOh, Vicki. Somehow I feel like Vicki isn\u2019t fully over Brooks and I don\u2019t think she ever will be. Why is she still talking about him? No one cares. And anything Vicki says about Brooks isn\u2019t going to change people\u2019s minds about Brooks or her possible involvement in his cancer scam. It\u2019s a shame Vicki can\u2019t seem to forget Brooks especially when her new boyfriends seems so great. I want Vicki to be happy, and I think she is with her new man so I wish she\u2019d just close the chapter on Brooks. You know, outta sight outta mind.\n\nThoughts on Vicki\u2019s interview? Why do you think Vicki still talks about Brooks? Was Brooks a monster? Do you believe Vicki never knew anything about Brooks cancer scam? Was Vicki\u2019s relationship with Brooks \u201cgreat?\u201d Does Vicki need to stop talking about Brooks?\n\nFollow AllAboutTRH On Instagram.\n\nFollow AllAboutTRH On Twitter.\n\nLike AllAboutTRH On Facebook.\n\nFollow the AllAboutTRH Podcast on iTunes & Soundcloud \u2013 Remember to Rate, Comment & Subscribe!"}
{"label": true, "txt": "Bachelor Nation, we made it to the finish line.\n\nOn Monday\u2019s three-hour season finale, Arie Luyendyk Jr., 36, made his final choice between publicist Becca Kufrin, 27, and sales executive Lauren Burnham, 26 \u2014 but how he came to his decision was unlike anything we\u2019ve seen before.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nSPOILER WARNING: The following contains major spoilers from Monday\u2019s finale. Read on at your own risk.\n\nThe final week of dates opens in Cusco, Peru, where Arie is still torn between his finalists. Making the situation even stickier is the fact that he\u2019s told both women he loves them \u2014 but neither of them knows he\u2019s also professed his love to the other.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in love with Becca and I\u2019m in love with Lauren, and I told them both that I love them \u2014 so I don\u2019t even know how I\u2019m going to deal with that,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the end of all this, I have to break someone\u2019s heart. And that makes that decision very tough.\u201d\n\nOn the one hand, there\u2019s Becca. She\u2019s been a frontrunner from the beginning \u2014 landing the first one-on-one date of the season \u2014 and their relationship has remained solid throughout.\n\n\u201cWith Becca, I know who she is,\u201d explains Arie. \u201cShe\u2019s laid all the cards out on the table. She\u2019s got great values, she loves her family, she\u2019s funny and goofy and sexy at the same time. It\u2019s so comfortable with her. I don\u2019t really have any worries about us after this, and that really gives me a lot of comfort.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s Lauren. One of four Laurens cast this season, she\u2019s been one of the most quiet and reserved contestants this franchise has ever seen \u2014 but all along, Arie has been drawn to her.\n\n\u201cWith Lauren, there\u2019s a little bit more of a risk just because I feel like through this whole thing she\u2019s been so reserved,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were always these intense feelings, from the moment I met her, and I was sort of peeling back these layers of someone and figuring them out. But I can see how much she loves me, and that gives me a lot of confidence.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: The Bachelor\u2018s Caroline Goes After Arie During Women Tell All \u2014 \u2018I Know What You Did\u2019\n\nLAUREN MEETS THE PARENTS\n\nArie\u2019s family travels to Peru to help guide him through the decision. He introduces them to Lauren first, and his main concern is that she\u2019s going to be shy and closed off. Though things get off to a slightly stilted start, Lauren eventually manages to win the family over, even shedding a few tears with Arie\u2019s mom.\n\n\u201cI would think she\u2019s the one,\u201d says Arie\u2019s mom. \u201cBut maybe tomorrow we\u2019ll think Becca is the one.\u201d\n\nBECCA MEETS THE PARENTS\n\nThe very next day, it\u2019s Becca\u2019s turn. Even though the family definitely takes a liking to her, the misfortune of going second means being inevitably compared to the first woman \u2014 and Arie\u2019s family certainly doesn\u2019t gloss over the awkwardness of the situation. Instead, they openly and repeatedly bring Lauren up, which shakes Becca.\n\n\u201cArie\u2019s dad said he would be happy with either one of us \u2014 that wasn\u2019t fun to hear at all,\u201d she admits later. \u201cLauren and I are so different. It\u2019s like trying to compare an apple to a starfish. And I don\u2019t want to be compared to her in any way, because she\u2019s still a huge threat to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI swear to God, if I have to hear the name Lauren one more time, I\u2019m going to lose it,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes me want to puke thinking about them together. I hate talking about Lauren.\u201d\n\nAfter Becca leaves, Arie regroups with his family to discuss how things went. They loved both girls and don\u2019t exactly think there\u2019s a \u201cwrong choice\u201d \u2014 but ultimately, they all swayed toward Becca.\n\n\u201cI love Lauren \u2014 but I think Becca would be better for your future,\u201d says Arie\u2019s mom. \u201cBecause I think you have to reassure Lauren all the time about your love, and Becca stands on her own.\u201d\n\nFINAL DATE WITH LAUREN\n\nThe morning of his very last date with Lauren, Arie wakes up having more or less made up his mind about picking Becca \u2014 but after spending the day exploring Machu Picchu with Lauren, everything gets turned upside down.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard because I thought I really had my feeling sorted out, but today Lauren has found her way into my heart,\u201d he says. \u201cLauren\u2019s amazing. I can tell you that she has a little speckle on her left eye, and there are just little things about her that I find so endearing and sweet and amazing. It\u2019s crazy to think I could say goodbye to someone like that.\u201d\n\nArie and Lauren Paul Hebert/ABC\n\nArie and Lauren Paul Hebert/ABC\n\nOn their final evening together, Lauren makes a point to lay all her cards out on the table.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so in love with you,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not scared of anything. I\u2019m so excited and I\u2019m ready to spend the rest of my life with you.\u201d\n\nThey spend the next few hours cuddling on the couch, envisioning their future together and wondering whether their dogs will get along. Arie provides constant reassurance to Lauren, telling her how much he loves her over and over again \u2014 and in her mind, she\u2019s got this in the bag.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Arie would have let me tell him all of those things about how much I care about him and talk about our future all day if he knew he was picking Becca,\u201d she says.\n\nAs for Arie? He seems pretty sold on Lauren at this point, too.\n\n\u201cThis is all I\u2019ve ever wanted from her since the moment I fell in love with her,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I had to propose this second, it would be her, right now. Lauren could be my wife. I feel really good about us, and I love her.\u201d\n\nFINAL DATE WITH BECCA\n\nAfter an emotionally charged day with Lauren, Arie heads right into his last date with Becca. They spend the day exploring Cusco, shopping and taking in the sights. And even though he seemed so confident in his decision mere hours ago, he flip-flops once again.\n\n\u201cGoing into today, I was just thinking about Lauren \u2014 but now I\u2019m conflicted,\u201d he admits. \u201cAfter spending the day with Becca, it really reminded me of all of her amazing qualities and why I was so attracted to her from the beginning.\u201d\n\nArie and Becca Paul Hebert/ABC\n\nArie and Becca Paul Hebert/ABC\n\nBecca, meanwhile, is also feeling uncertain \u2014 and begins to speculate that Arie might be equally in love with Lauren.\n\n\u201cI feel like Lauren is everything he\u2019s probably dated in the past,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s going to go with something that he\u2019s more used to \u2014 or me, who I think would challenge him a lot more and really want an equal partnership. I can\u2019t picture my future without him. Losing him in one day, to somebody who is so different than I am, to me right now is unimaginable.\u201d\n\nArie and Becca Paul Hebert/ABC\n\nThat night, Becca brings up some of her fears to Arie. While he confesses that he\u2019s conflicted in his decision, he still ends up providing her with constant reassurance, repeatedly telling her how much he loves her. And when Becca surprises him with a scrapbook of their journey together, he\u2019s clearly overwhelmed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in love with Becca, and tonight I could really feel how much she loved me and how much she wanted us,\u201d he says. \u201cI needed today to really help me make this decision \u2014 and I really realized Becca could be my wife.\u201d\n\nWatching Arie bounce back and forth between both women is exhausting, even just as a viewer \u2014 but it\u2019s also weighing heavily on Arie himself, especially considering he only has one night to make up his mind before the proposal.\n\n\u201cTomorrow I have to make the biggest decision of my life and I\u2019m struggling,\u201d he admits. \u201cI\u2019m in love with two women and I just don\u2019t know what to do. Both Becca and Lauren feel good about our relationships, and that\u2019s my fault, because I said \u2018I love you\u2019 to both of them. It makes me feel guilty, because the hardest breakups are the breakups you don\u2019t see coming.\u201d\n\nTHE BUILDUP\n\nBy the next morning, Arie claims to have made up his mind for once and for all.\n\n\u201cThese two relationships are very different, these two women are very different, and so I had to look inward and see what\u2019s important,\u201d he says. \u201cNow I finally realize who I can see myself growing old with. It feels so good to have that clarity. I couldn\u2019t have pictured a better women for me.\u201d\n\nHe picks out a ring with famed jeweler Neil Lane \u2014 and braces himself for what\u2019s to come.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting engaged today. On the one hand, this is the best day of my life,\u201d he reflects. \u201cBut on the other hand, it kills me inside to know that I\u2019m going to have to say goodbye to someone that I\u2019m in love with. She\u2019s not going to see this coming.\u201d\n\nTHE BREAKUP\n\nFinally, the moment we\u2019ve all been waiting for: At the bottom of a hill, Arie anxiously awaits the arrival of his runner-up \u2026 and out of the limo comes Lauren.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been through that breakup and I think the one thing you want is answers on why,\u201d Arie says as she makes her way towards him. \u201cI want to tell her something that could really help her through this, but I have no real reason to give her.\u201d\n\nMaking matters even worse is the fact that Lauren is fully expecting a proposal.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very, very excited and I don\u2019t have any doubts,\u201d she gushes. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine him not proposing to me today. He makes me feel very safe, and he loves me in a way I\u2019ve never known. I think Arie and I have a connection that\u2019s far beyond anything most people even have in their lifetime. It\u2019s just something so special and so rare \u2014 I do feel like he is my one true love.\u201d\n\nLauren Paul Hebert/ABC\n\nOnce she gets to him, she takes his hands in hers and launches into her speech. Arie, clearly emotional, finally shakes his head to stop her.\n\n\u201cI was awake all night thinking about this moment,\u201d he tells her. \u201cAnd I wanted it so bad for us. But there was something that was holding me back, and I just can\u2019t go through with it. It\u2019s not anything that I can explain other than that I gave it everything I had to see if it could work. I did fall in love with you.\u201d\n\nLauren is utterly speechless, and, in her own words, \u201cextremely confused.\u201d In silence and hand-in-hand, they make their way to the top of the hill, where a black SUV is waiting to whisk her away.\n\n\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d she finally asks him.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know, fully, until this morning,\u201d he says. \u201cI was in love with her, I was in love with you. I\u2019m sorry to put you through this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI still love you,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI love you, too,\u201d he responds.\n\nAnd just like that, the car door slams shut. She\u2019s gone, and Arie is left to face the consequences of his actions.\n\n\u201cI feel a little bit like a monster right now,\u201d he says. \u201cAll I really wanted to tell Lauren was \u2018I love you.\u2019 But I\u2019m saying goodbye.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel betrayed,\u201d Lauren, in tears, says as she\u2019s driven away. \u201cI mean, how could you do that to somebody? I don\u2019t get it. He just completely blindsided me. I let my guard down, I let someone in, and it still didn\u2019t work out. I wholeheartedly believed that he was going to be the one. I was wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said he\u2019s in love with me and he\u2019s in love with her and he had no idea what he was going to do until this morning,\u201d she continues, still reeling. \u201cDid that not terrify him? How can you get down on one knee if you weren\u2019t sure until like, three hours ago? I really think he made a mistake.\u201d\n\nTHE PROPOSAL\n\nArie proposes to Becca ABC\n\nAfter witnessing such a brutal breakup, it\u2019s hard to imagine that Arie would be able to propose to someone else just minutes later. But even though he looks visibly shaken, somehow, he still goes through with it.\n\n\u201cWhen I met you, I was taken aback,\u201d he says to Becca. \u201cYou are beautiful and elegant and in that first conversation, I knew that you were an incredible woman. I think back on our dates and I think back on meeting your family and I think back on all the moments that we shared, and the thing that stands out is that we\u2019re a team. I am very lucky that you\u2019ve been on this journey with me, and through all of it, you\u2019ve given me so much confidence along the way. Because of that, my love for you is immeasurable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis morning, I woke up and I thought about you,\u201d he continues, getting down on one knee. \u201cI thought about you and our kids together, I thought about us when we\u2019re old, and I choose you today. But I choose you every day from here on out. I love you so much. Becca, will you marry me?\u201d\n\nBecca Paul Hebert/ABC\n\nBecca, of course, says yes, and he slides the ring on her finger. As the camera pans out, they\u2019re the ultimate picture-perfect couple, newly engaged, kissing and twirling each other around in the Peruvian countryside.\n\n\u201cRebecca Jill Kufrin Luyendyk,\u201d she squeals to the camera. \u201cIt\u2019s got a ring to it!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen are we going to start having babies?\u201d he asks, turning to face her.\n\n\u201cTonight?\u201d she suggests. \u201cI\u2019m the happiest girl in the world right now. What is life?!\u201d\n\nTHE CHANGE OF HEART\n\nWhat is life, indeed. While a usual Bachelor finale ends there, Arie\u2019s journey did not. What happens next is equal parts fascinating, twisted, and, quite simply, brutal. First, we\u2019re privy to a montage of footage Becca and Arie filmed after taping their November engagement in Peru. We witness them kissing, goofing around making pizza, playing chess \u2014 from the outside, they seem like a blissful, newly engaged pair.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here, we\u2019re enjoying our time \u2014 alone,\u201d Arie says in one shot as the two cuddle in a hammock.\n\n\u201cAlone and in love,\u201d adds Becca.\n\n\u201cFinally,\u201d says Arie. \u201cIt feels good, and we love everyone and we want to say thank you. This journey has been amazing.\u201d\n\nBut behind closed doors, Arie is wrestling with his decision.\n\n\u201cSometimes when I\u2019m on these little getaways with Becca I think about, What would this be like with Lauren?\u201d he admits. \u201cIt just kills me, because I have a great woman next to me. I go to bed and I think about Lauren. I wake up and I think about Lauren. And I know Becca sees when I struggle. She sees the fact that my mind is somewhere else. She knows that I think about Lauren.\u201d\n\nArie explains that he thought his feelings for Lauren would have subsided over time \u2014 except they didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cWith Becca, I just feel an immense amount of guilt,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair for her to be in a relationship where someone is half in. I told Becca that I would choose her every day. I know I made that commitment, and it kills me that I\u2019m going back on that. But I have to follow my heart.\u201d\n\nAnd in case there was any doubt about what that meant, Arie lays it out for us, plain and simple: He\u2019s decided to call off the engagement and break up with Becca.\n\n\u201cJust thinking about the possibility of something with Lauren is making me want to risk it all,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause I really feel like I made a mistake. I\u2019ve had a change of heart. Look, I know this isn\u2019t going to be a popular decision. But it\u2019s worth it to me. I\u2019m doing it because I love Lauren.\u201d\n\nRELATED: The Bachelor\u2018s Arie Luyendyk Jr. Says He\u2019s \u2018Prepared for the Backlash\u2019 After the Dramatic Finale\n\nAt this point, however, Becca was completely unaware of Arie\u2019s plans to end things \u2014 which makes what happens next even more painful. One weekend in mid-January, Becca shows up at a house in Los Angeles, where she thinks she\u2019s going to get to spend a \u201chappy couple\u201d weekend with Arie. There\u2019s a camera crew, and she clearly assumes they\u2019re taping some sort of post-finale special.\n\n\u201cThe past few months have been such a whirlwind,\u201d she gushes. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I would leave The Bachelor an engaged woman, but I\u2019m so excited. I can see a future so clearly with Arie. I really just want to get to the point where the show is done and we can finally start our life together. I miss him when I\u2019m not with him!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s excruciating to watch, really. While she waits for Arie to arrive, she happily shows off the huge ring \u2014 \u201che did very well with the selection,\u201d she says, beaming.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Arie Luyendyk Jr. Says He Fell for Two Women on the Show \u2014 \u2018I Didn\u2019t Know I Was Capable of That\u2019\n\nFinally, Arie shows up and nervously shuffles Becca over to the couch. A crew scrambles to set up cameras on both sides of the room to capture every second of the conversation, from all angles. From there, we get to watch a split screen of the entire agonizing confrontation.\n\n\u201cHow do I start this?\u201d Arie begins, looking visibly uncomfortable. \u201cYou know that I\u2019ve been struggling a little bit. I think over the last couple of times we\u2019ve been hanging out, I\u2019ve been really trying to sort my feelings out and trying to grasp this whole thing. The reality of it is that being with you, although it\u2019s been everything that I wanted, I still think about her. I think you sense that.\u201d\n\nAs Becca sits in silence, Arie tries to justify his decision, explaining that the longer he stays with Becca, the more he feels like his window of opportunity for reconciliation with Lauren is narrowing.\n\n\u201cSo what? Do you want to be back with her?\u201d Becca asks.\n\n\u201cI want to see if there\u2019s that possibility,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAre you f\u2014ing kidding me?\u201d she responds.\n\nArie and Becca ABC\n\nIt\u2019s the first outburst of emotion Becca shows. Throughout the whole exchange, she\u2019s actually relatively composed \u2014 though it\u2019s obvious her silence isn\u2019t due to a lack of anger, but rather due to the fact that she\u2019s deeply mortified at the way this is all unfolding.\n\nFrom here on out, it doesn\u2019t get any better. It becomes apparent that Lauren has indeed been an issue in their relationship and Arie has already had some sort of \u201cconversation\u201d with her, though it\u2019s unclear when or under what circumstances. At one point, Becca calls Arie out for leading her to believe he wasn\u2019t serious about Lauren.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to be kidding me,\u201d she says. \u201cEverything that you told me about her, your relationship with her \u2014 you flat-out said you couldn\u2019t see a future with her, you couldn\u2019t quantify why you fell in love with her. Was that just words to me? You said you still had feelings for her that you were struggling with and I was trying to do what I could to help you. What did I do wrong?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong,\u201d responds Arie. \u201cYou were extremely patient with me, you allowed me to work through those feelings. I didn\u2019t really let you know to the extent.\u201d\n\nIn between long, painful silences, Becca eventually becomes resigned to the fact that it\u2019s over. She takes off her ring and tells him he should never have gotten down on one knee in the first place, then gets up and retreats to the bathroom to cry. Arie awkwardly follows her from room to room until she gives in and sits back down on the couch with him.\n\n\u201cI feel like my future was ripped away,\u201d she says, crying. \u201cLike, I love you. I obviously want you to be happy, and it\u2019s not me. I can\u2019t imagine my life without you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wanted those things for us, too,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I just can\u2019t give those to you if I\u2019m in love with someone else. I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so sorry we\u2019re here right now.\u201d\n\nFinally, after what feels like hours, she tells him to leave for once and for all. He obliges, and Becca is left crying and shaking on the couch, curled over in a puddle of tears.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t the last we saw of her: After the episode concluded, franchise host Chris Harrison brought Becca out on stage in front of the live studio audience to share her thoughts. The first word that came to mind?\n\n\u201cBrutal,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s brutal. I mean, when it all happened I feel like I kind of blacked out and so much was going through my mind that I couldn\u2019t take it all in or really focus on even what I wanted to say.

I was sad, I stayed in L.A. for a few days and cried for probably four days straight and grieved the loss of that relationship and the future that I thought were were going to have. I am angry at times, I feel betrayed a lot of the time just because I feel like I was lied to for so long.\u201d\n\nAs for what she has to say to him?\n\n\u201cI have a ton of questions,\u201d she said. \u201cBut at this point, it\u2019s like, anything I ask him \u2014 will I get a true answer?\u201d\n\nWe won\u2019t know the outcome of Arie\u2019s relationship with Lauren until Tuesday, when The Bachelor concludes with a two-hour live After the Final Rose special, starting at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.

It wasn\u2019t like one of us cheated or there was this bitterness,\u201d she explained. \u201cI still care a lot about him and there\u2019s no hard feelings. Hopefully on either side, but I can say that for me.\u201d\n\nUs broke the news in May that Tilley and the fellow Bachelor Nation star broke up after a couple of months of dating.

I just have really accepted that even though things don\u2019t work out romantically, if I find myself being able to have a connection with them even in a friendship way, if they\u2019re good people then I\u2019m happy to have them in my life.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not awkward to be around Higgins\u2019 ex-fianc\u00e9e Lauren Bushnell either. \u201cI\u2019m here for both of them as long as they\u2019re both in a happy place moving forward. I think that\u2019s all that matters,\u201d she told Us. \u201cI would love to see Ben as the Bachelor again, but I think he\u2019s like someone who takes it very serious and he wants to go on it when his heart\u2019s ready. And I don\u2019t think he\u2019s there right now.\u201d\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?

{"label": true, "txt": "Jamie Lynn Marie Spears[1] (born April 4, 1991) is an American actress and singer-songwriter. She was born in McComb, Mississippi, and raised in Louisiana, the younger sister of singer Britney Spears. She is known for her role as Zoey Brooks on the Nickelodeon teen sitcom Zoey 101, in which she starred from 2005 to 2008.\n\nSpears became the subject of significant media attention and controversy in 2007, when she announced she was pregnant at age 16, effectively sending her career into hiatus. In 2013, Spears launched a career in country music. She released her debut single, \"How Could I Want More\", along with her debut EP, The Journey.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nSpears was born in McComb, Mississippi, to James and Lynne Spears. Her older siblings are Bryan and Britney. She attended Parklane Academy, where she was a cheerleader and point guard of the basketball team. She finished her education via online correspondence[3] and received her GED in February 2008 through Tangipahoa Parish School System Adult Education Center.[4]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nIn February 2002, Spears made her acting debut in the Paramount Pictures drama film Crossroads which starred her sister, who portrayed the central character Lucy Wagner. Spears made a cameo, playing the younger version of Britney's character.[5] Following Crossroads, Nickelodeon cast Spears as a regular performer in the eighth season of the sketch comedy series All That. The season followed a two-year hiatus of the series. Spears portrayed various roles through the two seasons she appeared in as well as herself. Spears's performance received positive reviews from critics with many complimenting her comedic timing and being a highlight of the show. Spears did not return for the series' tenth and final season to pursue other roles on the network.\n\nIn August 2004, Spears signed a development deal with Nickelodeon in which she would star as the protagonist in her own scripted television series that would air on the network. The series went on to be titled Zoey 101 and Spears portrayed the role of Zoey Brooks. The series centered on Zoey and her friends who attend a fictional boarding school, Pacific Coast Academy (PCA). Spears recorded the series theme song, titled \"Follow Me\", which was written by her sister Britney Spears. Filmed at Pepperdine University in Malibu, California, the series premiered on January 9, 2005, the network's highest rated series premiere in over eight years. Spears won a Young Artist Award and a Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards for her performance.[6] Nickelodeon announced the fourth season would be the series' last season. The series finale, \"PCA Confidential\", aired on May 2, 2008.\n\nIn December 2007, Variety announced Spears had signed on to guest appear in the ABC comedy sitcom series Miss Guided, in which she played the role of the promiscuous high school student Mandy Fener in the episode \"Hot Sub\" which aired on March 20, 2008. That same year Spears voiced the role of Goldilocks in the direct-to-DVD animation film Unstable Fables: Goldilocks & 3 Bears Show. The film is the third and final installment of the Unstable Fables trilogy.\n\nNickelodeon issued a statement shortly after the announcement of her being pregnant at the age of 16 stating that the network respected Spears's decision to take responsibility and noting that its primary concern was for her well-being.[7]\n\nFollowing Spears's move to Nashville, she began working on a country music album with a number of local music producers. On November 7, 2011, Spears held a small concert at the Rutledge in Nashville in which she performed a set of original songs.[8]\n\nOn November 25, 2013, Spears released her first single \"How Could I Want More\" from her upcoming debut album.[9][10] The song debuted at number 29 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs.[11] Spears is featured on her older sister, Britney Spears's eighth studio album Britney Jean on the song \"Chillin' With You\".[12] On May 27, 2014, Spears released an EP called The Journey.[13] Jana Kramer recorded a song Spears co-wrote, \"I Got the Boy,\" which was released as the second single from Thirty One in 2015.[14]\n\nOn March 15, 2016, Spears performed at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. She was introduced by her two older siblings, Britney and Bryan, who made surprise appearances at the show.[15] On June 24, 2016, Spears released her second single, \"Sleepover.\"[16]\n\nIn an episode that aired on July 13, 2018, Spears returned to Nickelodeon for the first time in over ten years as a contestant on the revived game show Double Dare, with her daughter Maddie, competing against fellow All That alumnus Josh Server and his niece.[17] She and Maddie won over $15,000 to donate to the New Orleans hospital that treated Maddie following a near-fatal ATV accident [18]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nTeenage pregnancy [ edit ]\n\nOn December 20, 2007, in an interview with OK! magazine, Spears announced that she was pregnant by her then-boyfriend, Casey Aldridge.[19] She was 16 years old at the time. Aldridge, whom she had been dating for two years, was 18.[20] Spears gave birth to a daughter, Maddie Briann Aldridge, on June 19, 2008, at Southwest Mississippi Regional Medical Center in McComb, Mississippi.[21][22][23]\n\nSpears confirmed her engagement to Aldridge in March 2008 after it was reported she was seen wearing an engagement ring.[24] In May 2008, the couple moved back to Liberty, Mississippi, and purchased a house, with Spears stating they would raise their child there.[25] Spears and Aldridge called off their engagement in March 2009,[26][27] and Spears ended the relationship and moved out in February 2010.[28] Spears and Aldridge reconciled in August 2010,[29] but ended their relationship a second time in November 2010.[30][31]\n\nThe announcement of Spears's pregnancy generated controversy, as the media was accused of using the story to \"glamorize\" teenage pregnancy.[32][33] Some teens were disappointed with the contrast between Spears's on-screen personality as a \"good girl\" and her real life pregnancy.[34]\n\nControversy surfaced because Spears was two years below the California age of consent, raising questions about her and Aldridge's age difference, and whether Aldridge could or would be charged with statutory rape (although Spears was neither from California nor living there).[35][36] It was later confirmed that Aldridge was just under two years older than Spears, which meant that he could be charged only with a misdemeanor under California law, since the crime is only charged as a felony if the two people having sex are at least three years apart in age.[37][38] On June 4, 2008, while in Amite County, Mississippi, the Spears family filed a complaint against Edwin Merrino, a paparazzo who, they believed, was following and stalking the couple. Merrino denied the allegation. He was released later in the day after posting a $1,096 bond.[39]\n\nMarriage and family [ edit ]\n\nShe subsequently began a relationship with Jamie Watson, a businessman who owns communications service Advanced Media Partners. After two years of off and on dating, they announced their engagement in March 2013.[40][41] On March 14, 2014, she married Watson in New Orleans.[42] On April 11, 2018, Spears gave birth to her second child, a daughter named Ivey Joan Watson.[43][44]\n\nFilmography [ edit ]\n\nFilm roles Year Title Role Notes 2002 Crossroads Lucy Wagner (Young) 2008 The Goldilocks and the 3 Bears Show Goldilocks Voice role\n\nDiscography [ edit ]\n\nExtended plays [ edit ]\n\nSingles [ edit ]\n\nOther appearances [ edit ]\n\nMusic videos [ edit ]\n\nTitle Year Director Ref. \"How Could I Want More\" 2013 Matthew Underwood [52]\n\nAwards and nominations [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\nNotes\n\nA ^ Billboard Hot 100, but peaked at number 18 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Shania Twain, OC (; born Eilleen Regina Edwards; August 28, 1965) is a Canadian singer and songwriter. She has sold over 100 million records, making her the best-selling female artist in country music history and among the best-selling music artists of all time.[1][2][3] Her success garnered her several honorific titles including the \"Queen of Country Pop\".[4][5]\n\nRaised in Timmins, Ontario, Twain pursued singing and songwriting from a young age before signing with Mercury Nashville Records in the early 1990s. Her self-titled debut studio album saw little commercial success upon release in 1993. After collaborating with producer and later husband Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange, Twain rose to fame with her second studio album, The Woman in Me (1995), which brought her widespread success; it sold 20 million copies worldwide, spawned widely successful singles such as \"Any Man of Mine\", and earned her a Grammy Award. Her third studio album, Come On Over (1997), became the best-selling studio album of all-time by a female act in any genre and the best-selling country album, selling nearly 40 million copies worldwide.[6] Come On Over produced twelve singles, including \"You're Still the One\", \"From This Moment On\" and \"Man! I Feel Like a Woman!\", and earned Twain four Grammy Awards. Her fourth studio album, Up! (2002), was also certified Diamond in the United States.\n\nIn 2004, Twain retired from performing and began an indefinite hiatus from music, revealing years later that diagnoses with Lyme disease and dysphonia led to a severely weakened singing voice.[7][8][9][10] She chronicled her vocal rehabilitation on the OWN miniseries Why Not? with Shania Twain in 2011 and released her first single in six years, \"Today Is Your Day\", as well as publishing her autobiography, From This Moment On. Twain returned to the concert stage the following year with an exclusive concert residency at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace, Shania: Still the One, which ran until 2014. In 2015, she launched the North American Rock This Country Tour, which was billed as her farewell tour.[11][12] Twain released her fifth studio album and first in 15 years in 2017, Now, and embarked on the Shania Now Tour in 2018.\n\nTwain has received five Grammy Awards, 27 BMI Songwriter Awards, stars on Canada's Walk of Fame and the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and an induction into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame.[13] According to the RIAA she is the only female artist in history to have three (consecutive) albums certified Diamond by the RIAA.[14] Altogether, Twain is ranked as the 10th best-selling artist of the Nielsen SoundScan era.[15]\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nTwain was born Eilleen Regina Edwards in Windsor, Ontario on August 28, 1965[16] to Sharon (n\u00e9e Morrison) and Clarence Edwards. She has two sisters, Jill and Carrie Ann. Her parents divorced when she was two and her mother moved to Timmins, Ontario with her daughters. Sharon married Jerry Twain, an Ojibwa from the nearby Mattagami First Nation, and they had son Mark together. Jerry adopted the girls and legally changed their surname to Twain. When Mark was a toddler, Jerry and Sharon adopted Jerry's baby nephew Darryl when his mother died. Because of Twain's connection to Jerry, the media have reported that she is of Ojibwe descent,[17] but she stated in an interview that her biological father was part Cree, a claim his family denies.[18] Her confirmed ancestry includes English, French, and Irish.[19][20] Through a maternal great-grandmother, she is a descendant of French carpenter Zacharie Cloutier.[21] Her Irish maternal grandmother, Eileen Pearce, emigrated from Newbridge, County Kildare.[22]\n\nTwain has said she had a difficult childhood. Her parents earned little money and food was often scarce in their household. Twain did not confide her situation to school authorities, fearing they might break up the family. Her mother and stepfather's marriage was stormy at times, and from a young age she witnessed violence between them. Her mother also struggled with bouts of depression. In mid-1979, while Jerry was at work, at Twain's insistence, her mother drove the rest of the family 420 miles (680 km) south to a Toronto homeless shelter for assistance.[23] Sharon returned to Jerry with the children in 1981. In Timmins, Twain started singing at bars at the age of eight to try to help pay her family's bills; she often earned $20 between midnight and 1 a.m. performing for remaining customers after the bar had finished serving alcohol. Although she expressed a dislike for singing in those bars, Twain believes that this was her own kind of performing-arts school on the road.[24] She has said of the ordeal, \"My deepest passion was music and it helped. There were moments when I thought, 'I hate this.' I hated going into bars and being with drunks. But I loved the music and so I survived.\"[25] Twain wrote her first songs at the age of 10, \"Is Love a Rose\" and \"Just Like the Storybooks,\" which were rhyming fairy tales.[26] She states that the art of creating, of actually writing songs, \"was very different from performing them and became progressively important\".[26]\n\nAt age 13, Twain was invited to perform on the CBC's Tommy Hunter Show. While attending Timmins High and Vocational School, she was also the singer for a local band called Longshot, which covered Top 40 music.[27] In the early 1980s, Twain spent some time working with her father's reforestation business in northern Ontario, which employed some 75 Ojibwe and Cree workers. Although the work was demanding and the pay low, Twain said, \"I loved the feeling of being stranded. I'm not afraid of being in my own environment, being physical, working hard. I was very strong, I walked miles and miles every day and carried heavy loads of trees. You can't shampoo, use soap or deodorant, or makeup, nothing with any scent; you have to bathe and rinse your clothes in the lake. It was a very rugged existence, but I was very creative and I would sit alone in the forest with my dog and a guitar and would just write songs.\"[28]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\n1983\u20131992: Beginnings [ edit ]\n\nTwain graduated from Timmins High in June 1983 eager to expand her musical horizons.[29] After Longshot's demise, Twain was approached by a cover band led by Diane Chase called \"Flirt\" and toured all over Ontario with them.[29] She also took singing lessons from Toronto-based coach Ian Garrett, often cleaning his house as payment.[30] In the autumn of 1984, Twain's talents were noticed by Toronto DJ Stan Campbell who wrote about her in a Country Music News article: \"Eilleen possesses a powerful voice with an impressive range. She has the necessary drive, ambition and positive attitude to achieve her goals\".[30] Campbell happened to be making an album by Canadian musician (and present-day CKTB radio personality) Tim Denis at the time and Twain was featured on the backing vocals of the song Heavy on the Sunshine.[31][30] Campbell later took Twain to Nashville to record some demos, which she found particularly difficult to finance. She became acquainted with regional country singer Mary Bailey who had had some country chart success in 1976. Bailey had seen Twain perform in Sudbury, Ontario, saying \"I saw this little girl up on stage with a guitar and it absolutely blew me away. She performed Willie Nelson's \"Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain\" and Hank Williams' \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\". Her voice reminded me of Tanya Tucker, it had strength and character, a lot of feeling. She's a star, she deserves an opportunity.\"[32] Bailey later said \"She sang a few songs that she had written, and I thought to myself, this kid is like nineteen years old, where does she get this? This is from a person who's lived sixty years\".[33]\n\nBailey acquired the contract from Stan Campbell and Twain moved into Bailey's home on Kenogami Lake where she practised her music every day for hours. In the fall of 1985, Bailey took Twain down to Nashville to stay with a friend, record producer Tony Migliore, who at the time was producing an album for fellow Canadian singer Kelita Haverland and Twain was featured on the backing vocals to the song Too Hot to Handle. She also recorded \"demo\" songs with Cyril Rawson but those efforts were unsuccessful, partly due to Twain's wish to become a rock singer, not a country artist. After five months she returned to Canada and moved in with Bailey in a flat in downtown Kirkland Lake, not far from Kenogami.[34] There she met rock keyboardist Eric Lambier, drummer Randy Yurko, guitarist Tom Gustar and formed a new band, moving three months later to Bowmanville, near Toronto. In late summer 1986, Mary Bailey arranged for Twain to meet John Kim Bell, a half Mohawk, half American conductor who had close contacts with the directors of the Canadian Country Music Association. Bell recognized Twain's ability as well as her looks and the two began secretly dating.[34] In the fall of 1986 Twain continued to express her desire to be a pop or rock singer rather than country, which led to her falling out with Mary Bailey for two years. Twain's first break finally came on February 8, 1987, when Bell staged a fundraiser for the National Aboriginal Achievement Foundation, now Indspire, at the Roy Thomson Hall in Toronto where Twain performed with Broadway star Bernadette Peters, jazz guitarist Don Ross, and the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. Her performance received little acclaim, but it convinced Bell, who hated pop music, that Twain should stay well away from it and concentrate on country music.[35]\n\nOn November 1, 1987, Twain's mother and stepfather died in a car accident approximately 50 kilometres north of Wawa, Ontario.[36] She moved back to Timmins to take care of her younger siblings and took them all to Huntsville, Ontario, where she supported them by earning money performing at the nearby Deerhurst Resort.[37]\n\n1993\u20131994: Shania Twain [ edit ]\n\nSeveral years later, when Twain's siblings moved out on their own, she assembled a demo tape of her songs and her Huntsville manager set up a showcase for her to present her material to record executives. She caught the attention of a few labels, including Mercury Nashville Records, who signed her within a few months.[38] During this time, she changed her name to Shania, which was said to be an Ojibwa word which means \"on my way.\" However, Twain's biographer, Robin Eggar, writes: \"There is a continuing confusion about what 'Shania' means and if indeed it is an Ojibwe word or phrase at all. [...] There is no mispronounced or misheard phrase in either Ojibwe or Cree that comes close to meaning 'on my way.' Yet the legend of her name continues to be repeated in the media to this day.\"[39]\n\nTwain's self-titled debut album was released in 1993 in North America and garnered her audiences outside Canada. Shortly before its release, she sang backing vocals for other Mercury artists, including Jeff Chance's 1992 album Walk Softly on the Bridges[40] and Sammy Kershaw's 1993 album Haunted Heart.[41] Shania Twain only reached No.67 on the US Country Albums Chart, but it gained positive reviews from critics. The album failed to sell significant copies initially. However, Twain's future success generated enough interest for the album to be certified platinum six years later by the RIAA, denoting sales of over 1 million. The album yielded two minor hit singles in the United States with \"What Made You Say That\" and \"Dance with the One That Brought You\". The album was more successful in Europe, where Twain won Country Music Television Europe's \"Rising Video Star of the Year\" award.[38] In her 2011 autobiography From This Moment On, Twain expressed displeasure with her debut studio album, revealing that she had very little creative control and expressed frustration with not being able to showcase her songwriting ability.[42]\n\n1995\u20131996: The Woman in Me and commercial success [ edit ]\n\nWhen rock producer Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange heard Twain's original songs and singing from her debut album, he offered to produce and write songs with her. After many telephone conversations, they met at Nashville's Fan Fair in June 1993. Twain and Lange became very close within just weeks, culminating in their wedding on December 28, 1993. Lange and Twain either wrote or co-wrote the songs that would form her second studio album, The Woman in Me.[38][43]\n\nThe Woman in Me was released on February 7, 1995. The album's first single, \"Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?\" went to No. 11 on the Billboard Country Chart. This was followed by her first Country Top 10 and No.1 hit single, \"Any Man of Mine\", which also cracked the Top 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. Twain had further hits from the album, including the title track which peaked at No.14 and three additional No.1 hits: \"(If You're Not in It for Love) I'm Outta Here!\", \"You Win My Love\", and \"No One Needs to Know\", which was selected for the original soundtrack for the 1996 film Twister, a first for Twain, plus minor country hit \"Home Ain't where His Heart Is (Anymore)\" and a re-recorded gospel version of the album track \"God Bless The Child\" with new lyrics.[38] Meanwhile, in Australia, five of these singles: \"Any Man of Mine\", \"The Woman in Me\", \"I'm Outta Here!\" \"You Win My Love\" and \"God Bless The Child,\" were remixed for the Australian pop market, and \"I'm Outta Here!\" became Twain's breakthrough hit there, reaching No.5 on the ARIA charts.[citation needed]\n\nAs of 2007, the album had sold more than 12 million copies.[44] The album was a quick breakthrough and because of this Twain performed selected international venues and television shows including two CMA Fan Fair performances with Nashville guitarists Randy Thomas (co-writer of the song \"Butterfly Kisses\"), Dan Schafer,[45] Chris Rodriguez, Russ Taff, Hugh McDonald bass player of Bon Jovi, Dave Malachowski and Stanley T., formerly with The Beach Boys.[citation needed]\n\nMercury Nashville's promotion of the album was based largely upon a series of music videos.[46] During this period, Twain made major television appearances on shows such as two performances on Late Show with David Letterman, Blockbuster Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards and the American Music Awards. The Woman in Me won the Grammy Award for Best Country Album[47] as well as the Academy of Country Music award for Album of the Year;[48] the latter group also awarded Twain as Best New Female Vocalist.[49]\n\n1997\u20132001: Come On Over and international pop breakthrough [ edit ]\n\nIn 1997, Twain released her follow-up album, Come On Over. This was the album that would establish her as a successful crossover singer. Slowly, following the release of lead singles Love Gets Me Every Time\" and \"Don't Be Stupid (You Know I Love You)\", which allowed Twain to make more appearances in the Billboard Hot 100, the album started racking up sales. It never hit the top spot, but with the multi-chart hit single \"You're Still the One\", sales skyrocketed. Other songs like \"When\", \"Honey, I'm Home\", \"You've Got a Way\", \"Man! I Feel Like a Woman!\", \"That Don't Impress Me Much\", and \"From This Moment On\" joined the 12 songs that eventually saw release as singles. \"From This Moment On\" is a duet with singer Bryan White and there was a re-recorded solo pop version as well.[50]\n\nThe album stayed on the charts for the next two years, going on to sell 40 million copies worldwide, making it the biggest-selling album of all time by a female musician.[51] She continued to break international boundaries for country music and female crossover artists. It is also the eighth biggest-selling album by any type of artist in the US[44] and the top selling country album in history. Songs from the album won four Grammy Awards during this time, including Best Country Song and Best Female Country Performance (for \"You're Still the One\" and \"Man! I Feel Like a Woman!\") for Twain. Lange won Grammys for \"You're Still the One\" and \"Come On Over\".[citation needed]\n\nDespite the album's record sales it wasn't able to top the Billboard 200, peaking at No. 2. In 1998, following the pop release of \"You're Still the One\", the Come On Over album was released in a remixed format for the European market as a pop album with less country instrumentation, and actually gave her the big breakthrough in Europe she and her producer husband Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange were looking for. Come On Over went to No. 1 on the UK album charts for 11 weeks. It became the biggest selling album of the year in Great Britain and a bestseller in other big European markets as well, selling more than one million copies in Germany and nearly 4 million in the UK alone. Although \"You're Still The One\" and the pop version of \"From This Moment On\" cracked the Top 10 of the UK charts and \"When\" had minor success in the Top 20, the songs that had finally drawn European attention to the album were the pop remixed singles \"That Don't Impress Me Much\", a No.3 in the UK and Top 10 hit in Germany in the summer of 1999, and \"Man! I Feel Like a Woman!\" which peaked at No.3 in both the UK and France in autumn of that year. Additionally, \"You've Got a Way\" was remixed specifically for inclusion on the Notting Hill soundtrack. Subsequently, a reissue of the international version of the album was released worldwide, including the US and Europe, containing three of these new remixes. Additionally, the album set the record for the longest ever stay in the Top 20 of the Billboard 200, remaining in the Top 20 for 99 weeks.[citation needed]\n\nIn 1998, Twain launched her first major concert tour, aided by her manager Jon Landau, a veteran of many large-scale tours with Bruce Springsteen. The Come On Over Tour shows were a success, winning the \"Country Tour of the Year\" in 1998 and 1999 by Pollstar Concert Industry Awards.[52]\n\nIn 2000, Twain was initially scheduled to release a Christmas album, but plans to release one were cancelled later in the year.[53]\n\nFollowing the success of Come On Over, independent label Limelight Records released The Complete Limelight Sessions in October 2001. The album includes 16 tracks recorded in the late 1980s before Twain signed her record deal with Mercury.[citation needed]\n\nAfter a change in management \u2013 QPrime replaced Landau \u2013 and a two-year break, along with the birth of their son, Eja (pronounced \"Asia\") D'Angelo, who was born on August 12, 2001,[54] Twain and Lange returned to the studio. Up! was released on November 19, 2002. On January 26, 2003, Twain performed at the Super Bowl halftime show. About a year later, Twain kicked off the Up! Tour in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada on September 25, 2003. Up! was released with three different discs \u2013 country/acoustic (green CD), pop/rock (red CD), and world/dance (blue CD). Up! was given four out of five stars by Rolling Stone magazine, and debuted at No.1 on the Billboard albums chart, selling 874,000 in the first week alone. It remained at the top of the charts for five weeks. Twain's crossover appeal in country, pop, and dance music, led the album Up! to sell over 11 million copies by 2004. Up! reached No.1 in Germany, No.2 in Australia and the Top Five in the UK and France. In Germany, Up! was certified 4x platinum and stayed in the Top 100 for one and a half years. The international music disc was remixed with Indian-style orchestral and percussion parts recorded in Mumbai, India. The new versions were produced by Simon and Diamond Duggal, brothers from Birmingham, England. They were originally invited to contribute parts to the pop version of \"I'm Gonna Getcha Good!\" which retained the Indian influence.[55]\n\nTwain's popularity in UK was reflected by numerous appearances on the long-running music show Top of the Pops, performing singles from Come On Over from 1999. In 2002 an entire special show was dedicated to her on sister show TOTP2, in which Twain herself introduced some past performances of her greatest hits and new singles from Up!.[56] In November 2004, she appeared on the annual BBC charity telethon Children in Need. During the show, she performed \"Up!\", and then took part in an all-star magic act in which she was sawn in half by magician Scott Penrose in an illusion called Clearly Impossible.[57]\n\nThe first single from the album, \"I'm Gonna Getcha Good!\" became a top 10 country hit in the US, after debuting at No. 24 after only five days of airplay; but only made the Top 40 on the pop charts. It was a much bigger hit on the other side of the Atlantic, released in a pop version, the single hit No. 4 in the UK. In Australia, Germany and France the song reached the Top 15 in each case. The follow-up single, \"Up!\", reached the Top 15 in the US country charts but failed to reach the pop Top 40. The second European single became the mid-tempo song \"Ka-Ching!\" (which was never released as a single in North America) with lyrics where Twain was criticizing unchecked consumerism. The song eventually became another smash hit in the important European markets, reaching No.1 in Germany and Austria and other European countries, the UK Top 10 and the Top 15 in France.\n\nThe third single from the album would be the most successful in the US. The romantic ballad \"Forever and for Always\" was released as a single in April 2003 and peaked at No.4 on the country chart and No.1 on the Adult Contemporary chart, and made as well the Billboard Top 20. Again success was even bigger on the other side of the Atlantic with \"Forever and For Always\" again reaching the Top 10 in both, the UK and Germany. Further singles were \"She's Not Just a Pretty Face\", which was a country Top 10 hit, while the last US single, \"It Only Hurts When I'm Breathing\", made the Top 20 on both Country and AC. Due to the enormous European success of Up! and its first three singles, two more singles were released in the second half of 2003 with up-tempo \"Thank You Baby\" (No. 11 in the UK, Top 20 in Germany) and just before Christmas the romantic, acoustic ballad \"When You Kiss Me,\" at least a minor hit in both territories. The title track \"Up!\" also saw a single release in a limited edition of European countries, such as Germany, in early 2004. In January 2008, Up! had sold 5.5 million copies in the US and was certified by the RIAA as 11x platinum (the organization counts double albums as two units).[44]\n\n2004\u20132010: Greatest Hits and delay of new album [ edit ]\n\nIn 2004, she released the Greatest Hits album, with three new tracks. As of 2012, it had sold over 4.15 million copies in the US.[44] The first single, the multi-format duet \"Party for Two\", made the country top ten with Billy Currington, while the pop version with Sugar Ray lead singer Mark McGrath made top ten in the United Kingdom and Germany. The follow-up singles, \"Don't!\" and \"I Ain't No Quitter\" did not fare as well. The former made Top 20 on Adult Contemporary, while the latter did not gain enough airplay to reach the Country Top 40.[58]\n\nIn August 2005, she released the single \"Shoes\" from the Desperate Housewives soundtrack. In 2008, Twain and Anne Murray recorded a duet version of Murray's hit \"You Needed Me\" for her 2007 album, Anne Murray Duets: Friends & Legends.[59]\n\nIn June 2009, Twain released a letter to her fans explaining the delays in the release of her next album, noting she had gone through personal pains and was focusing on raising her son Eja.[60] In August 2009, at a conference in Timmins, Ontario, a spokesman for Twain's label said a new record from the singer was still \"nowhere in sight\".[61]\n\n2011\u20132015: Return to music, residency, and tour [ edit ]\n\nTwain announcing her upcoming Caesars Palace show in Las Vegas in 2011\n\nIn May 2011, Twain confirmed in an interview that she would release her first new single in six years, \"Today Is Your Day\", after the finale of Why Not? with Shania Twain.[62] Twain previewed the song in the first episode of the series.[62] Twain worked with music producers David Foster and Nathan Chapman on the song. She also published her autobiography with Atria Books, From This Moment On. The last episode of \"Why Not?\" features Twain and Lionel Richie recording \"Endless Love\" which would be the first single from his 2012 album, Tuskegee.[63] \"Today Is Your Day\" was officially released to iTunes and country radio on June 12, 2011.[64] In addition to \"Today Is Your Day\", Twain also collaborated with Michael Bubl\u00e9 on his 2011 album Christmas (also produced by David Foster). Twain recorded \"White Christmas\" with Bubl\u00e9, which was the first single from the album.[65] On June 8, 2011, at a press conference at the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville, Twain announced that she would headline Caesars Palace in Las Vegas for two years.[64] Her show, titled Still the One, began on December 1, 2012, with shows expected to run in 2013 and 2014.[citation needed]\n\nIn July 2013, Twain announced on Facebook that she was working on her album over the summer during a break from Still the One. In October 2013, Twain sat down with Robin Roberts from Good Morning America as a featured artist on the Countdown to the CMA Awards. In the interview, Twain said that a new album was coming, but she said that she was still in the process of finding the right producer.[citation needed]\n\nOutside of her show at Caesars Palace, Twain performed two concerts at the Calgary Stampede in Calgary, Alberta, on July 9 and 10, 2014. In a series of interviews leading up to her Calgary Stampede shows, Twain said she hoped to tour in 2015 and that it would lead to the release of a new album.[66] Alongside her Calgary Stampede shows, Twain also headlined a show on Labour Day weekend at Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada.[67]\n\nOn March 4, 2015, Twain announced on Good Morning America she would be going on tour for the first time in 11 years, and would begin June 5 in Seattle, Washington and end on October 11 in Toronto, Ontario. Twain also announced this would be her last tour before her fifth studio album, which she intends to release while she is 50.[68] In an interview on Global Television Network's The Morning Show on March 6, Twain confirmed that she is not retiring from her music career after the tour.[69] In an interview with Radio.com published on March 5, she stated that she has found several producers for her upcoming album, describing it as \"soul music\".[70]\n\nOn August 24, 2015, Twain stated: \"First, I have to finish my new album this winter. Six tracks are already completed. I've written 38 songs in total, and now the process is underway to narrow that down to another six or eight to finish recording\". That same month, it was announced by several sources, that even though her current Rock This Country Tour is her final time touring, she is possibly planning on extending the tour overseas because the Rock This Country tour was only based in the United States and Canada. Twain also mentioned, possibly returning to Las Vegas with a new residency show for possibly late 2016 or 2017. The new show would end up featuring music from her long-awaited new album as well as her hits.[71]\n\n2016\u2013present: Now and Christmas album [ edit ]\n\nIn October 2016, Twain confirmed to Rolling Stone that she had new music coming \"really soon.\"[72] In December 2016 in an interview with Billboard, she spoke about her forthcoming album, describing the finished product as \"kind of schizophrenic musically\" maintaining \"She's the glue\".[73] In February 2017, Twain again spoke to Rolling Stone about the album; select song titles were confirmed, as Twain detailed that she had not only hoped to release a single in March, but that she planned to release the album in May.[74] She performed at the 2017 Stagecoach Festival, held on April 29.[75]\n\nIn April 2017, Billboard announced that Twain's new single, \"Life's About to Get Good\", would premiere in June, with the album projected for release in September. Twain headlined the 2017 Stagecoach Festival in Indio, California, where she previewed her new music for the first time.[76] Twain performed on the Today Show's \"Summer Concert Series\" on June 16, 2017.[77] Her fifth studio album, Now, was released on September 29, 2017[78] and would debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.[79]\n\nIn June 2017, Twain announced on ET Canada that she would in fact tour with her new album Now.[80] The Now Tour was announced by Twain on her official website on August 17, 2017.[81]\n\nThe album's second single, \"Swingin' With My Eyes Closed\", was released on August 18, 2017.[82] She has also internationally released two other promotional singles off of Now, including \"Poor Me\" and \"We've Got Something They Don't\".[83][84]\n\nDuring an appearance on Today, Twain confirmed she was beginning work on a Christmas album which will feature a collaboration with John Travolta.[citation needed]\n\nTV career [ edit ]\n\nTwain's mainstream pop acceptance was further helped by her appearance in the 1998 first edition of the VH1 Divas concert where she sang alongside Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, Gloria Estefan, Carole King and Aretha Franklin, and also by VH1's 1999 heavily aired Behind the Music, which concentrated on the tragic aspects of her early life as well as her physical attractiveness and Nashville's early resistance to her bare-midriff music videos. After Divas, Shania Twain wrote and/or sang background vocals with her then husband Robert John \"Mutt\" Lange the songs, \"If Walls Could Talk\" and \"Goodbye's (The Saddest Word)\" for Celine Dion.\n\nOn November 12, 2008, Twain made her first television appearance since her split from ex-husband Robert \"Mutt\" Lange, where she appeared as a surprise presenter at the 42nd CMA Awards.[85]\n\nIn 2009, Twain served as a guest judge on American Idol, for the show's August 30 and 31 episodes.[86][87]\n\nIn April 2010, Twain announced plans for her own TV show, titled Why Not? with Shania Twain. The show debuted on May 8, 2011 on OWN.[88] Twain returned to American Idol as a guest mentor for a week where the top 6 contestants showcased her songs.[89] After the conclusion of the ninth season Twain was very close to becoming a judge but ultimately it was Jennifer Lopez who got the job.[90]\n\nTwain guest starred on the Comedy Central series Broad City, in a September 2017 episode titled \"Twaining Day\".[91]\n\nOn October 23, 2017, Twain appeared as a guest judge on the 25th season of Dancing with the Stars during the show's \"Movie Night\", and also performed her song \"Soldier\".[92][93] Twain will be a guest judge on the 10th Season of Rupaul's Drag Race.[94]\n\nIn November 2018, Twain appeared in the reality talent show Real Country, as an executive producer and co-presenter with Jake Owen and Travis Tritt.[95]\n\nEndorsements [ edit ]\n\nIn January 2005, Twain joined Scentstories by Febreze to create a limited edition scent disc with the proceeds going to America's Second Harvest.[96]\n\nIn late 2005, Twain partnered with Coty to produce her namesake fragrance \"Shania\" by Stetson. A second fragrance was released in September 2007, called \"Shania Starlight\".[97]\n\nOn January 1, 2010, Twain carried the Olympic Torch through her hometown as part of the 2010 Winter Olympics torch relay.[98]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nTwain is a vegetarian[99][100] and a devotee of Sant Mat, an Eastern spiritual philosophy.[101] In 2009, she was reported as having the \"perfect face\".

Good Morning America also announced the news Tuesday.\n\n\"It was the happiest moment of my life.

Luyendyk proposed to Kufrin only to break-up with her on-camera and make a play for his season's runner-up Lauren Burnham.\n\nLuyendyk and Burnham are now engaged and announced on The View Wednesday they will marry in a private ceremony in Maui on Jan. 12.\n\nKufrin says after her public break-up, she grieved. \u201cI was confused and angry and all the emotions you go through a heartbreak with,\u201d she said to People.

The account, @onionringsworldwide, seemed fairly new, with only four posts and 24 followers, including Lorde and a number of her friends.\n\nWhile @onionringsworldwide, whose bio read, \u201cEvery onion ring I encounter, rated\u201d, only had four posts, those four posts each gave plenty of clues leading back to Lorde, according to this 17-year-old fan. Like any good food Intagrammer, each caption included the name of the restaurant said onion ring was acquired from, and a review of the ring. That alone, plus knowing where Lorde is on her promotional tour (and knowing the look of her nails?), helped the fan build a strong case that this account was actually run by Lorde.\n\nEven more evidence that this account was run by non-Royal Lorde? Newshub reached out to her management and they didn\u2019t respond. Instead? The account has since been deleted.\n\nNewshub contacted Lorde\u2019s management to ask whether Lorde likes onion rings, whether she prefers a light batter on her onion rings, and whether she runs the account.\n\nManagement had not responded at the time of writing, but shortly after questions were sent through, we\u2019re sad to report the onionringsworldwide account was removed from Instagram.\n\nA few things about this: A) why does it matter if she secretly runs this innocent account? It\u2019s not going to effect her popularity. Why are they treating this like she ran a pro-life Instagram? B) why didn\u2019t her management give a statement or respond at all to Newshub? C) She reviewed a Burger King onion ring, and that just seems like a lost cause.\n\nListen, if Lorde wants to have some semblance of normality in her life, let her just have an anonymous account, maintaining it while she flies private between Bonaroo and Bev Hills. But she can\u2019t be the only celeb who has a secret social media account, right? I don\u2019t know for sure, but here are my best guesses as to what type of accounts these famous people are managing under the shroud of internet secrecy.\n\nEDIT: LORDE IS ON JIMMY FALLON AS I\u2019M WRITING THIS AND SHE CONFIRMED IT WAS HER ACCOUNT.\n\nShe said, \u201cI sort of naively didn\u2019t realize it would be a thing.. it was like a good past time\u2026 I deleted it because now people are going to be throwing onion rings (at me) on tour\u2026 I don\u2019t think they get enough credit for how delicious they are.\u201d\n\nUgh.

{"label": true, "txt": "Charlize Theron has officially weighed in on the possibility of playing a female version of James Bond. Daniel Craig is still playing 007 for now, but James Bond 25, which is set to arrive in theaters next November, is said to be his last. That means, the franchise is heading for a reboot in the next couple of years and there's been talk, mostly from fans, about having a female Bond. Theron's name has been thrown around and now she's addressed the possibility.\n\nDuring a recent interview, Charlize Theron was asked about playing James Bond. Nobody involved with the franchise, as far as we know, is actually looking at a female to play 007 in the future. Nor is there any indication Theron has been specifically approached, but her name has been bandied about, largely thanks to her roles in movies like Mad Max: Fury Road and Atomic Blonde. Theron says she likes the idea of going against type, but she feels she's too old for the part. Here's what she had to say about it.\n\n\"You know, I don't have a feeling about it one way or the other. I love the idea that people are thinking outside the box. And I know for a long time people were talking about Idris Elba for it. And it's just nice to see people now thinking outside of [these] confined ideas of what we think a character can be. I'm really all for that. I think it's great that we are developing more characters within that genre for females, that they can take ownership. So it's a really nice thing for people to say. I'm very old, though. I would be a very old James Bond.\"\n\nCharlize Theron has made quite the name for herself as a female action star in recent years, so it's understandable that if a gender-swapped version of James Bond is on the horizon, her name would be at the top of people's lists. Some fan art depicting her as the iconic MI6 spy even made the rounds online last year. Gillian Anderson from The X-Files is also a favorite for the part and she's even shown support for the idea.\n\nAs Charlize Theron points out, Idris Elba has been a name thrown out over the years, which also would represent a change for the character, as James Bond has always been portrayed as a white man. In regards to her being too old? That's not necessarily true. Daniel Craig is going to be 50 by the time James Bond 25 gets going and Roger Moore played the part until he was 57. That said, Theron, who is now 42, would be in her mid-40s by the time the opportunity came up, which may be a bit old for someone to start their tenure as the new 007.\n\nRelated: James Bond 25 Gets True Detective Director Cary Fukunaga, Release Date Delayed\n\nThe producers of the James Bond franchise are going to have a tough time following up Daniel Craig and one way to gain some attention would be to try something different. Though, gender-swapping one of the most iconic characters in cinema history may turn more fans off than it would bring to the franchise. At the very least, some changes could be coming. Producer Barbara Broccoli said last year that she's open to have a female direct a future Bond movie, which could help bring some new perspective to the character and the franchise. In any event, it doesn't sound like Charlize Theron plans on putting on a tux and taking out bad guys with a Walther PPK in the future. This news comes to us courtesy of Yahoo."}

Astounded and offended by Weinstein's attempt to coerce her into bed, Judd managed to escape. But instead of keeping quiet about the kind of encounter that could easily shame a woman into silence, she began spreading the word.\n\n\"I started talking about Harvey the minute that it happened,\" Judd says in an interview with TIME. \"Literally, I exited that hotel room at the Peninsula Hotel in 1997 and came straight downstairs to the lobby, where my dad was waiting for me, because he happened to be in Los Angeles from Kentucky, visiting me on the set. And he could tell by my face\u2014to use his words\u2014that something devastating had happened to me. I told him.

It allowed for people to warn others to some degree, but there was no route to stop the abuse. \"Were we supposed to call some fantasy attorney general of moviedom?\" Judd asks. \"There wasn't a place for us to report these experiences.\"\n\nFinally, in October\u2014when Judd went on the record about Weinstein's behavior in the New York Times , the first star to do so\u2014the world listened. (Weinstein said he \"never laid a glove\" on Judd and denies having had nonconsensual sex with other accusers.)\n\nWhen movie stars don't know where to go, what hope is there for the rest of us? What hope is there for the janitor who's being harassed by a co-worker but remains silent out of fear she'll lose the job she needs to support her children? For the administrative assistant who repeatedly fends off a superior who won't take no for an answer? For the hotel housekeeper who never knows, as she goes about replacing towels and cleaning toilets, if a guest is going to corner her in a room she can't escape?\n\nLike the \"problem that has no name,\" the disquieting malaise of frustration and repression among postwar wives and homemakers identified by Betty Friedan more than 50 years ago, this moment is born of a very real and potent sense of unrest. Yet it doesn't have a leader, or a single, unifying tenet. The hashtag #MeToo (swiftly adapted into #BalanceTonPorc, #YoTambien, #Ana_kaman and many others), which to date has provided an umbrella of solidarity for millions of people to come forward with their stories, is part of the picture, but not all of it.\n\nThis reckoning appears to have sprung up overnight. But it has actually been simmering for years, decades, centuries. Women have had it with bosses and co-workers who not only cross boundaries but don't even seem to know that boundaries exist. They've had it with the fear of retaliation, of being blackballed, of being fired from a job they can't afford to lose. They've had it with the code of going along to get along. They've had it with men who use their power to take what they want from women. These silence breakers have started a revolution of refusal, gathering strength by the day, and in the past two months alone, their collective anger has spurred immediate and shocking results: nearly every day, CEOs have been fired, moguls toppled, icons disgraced. In some cases, criminal charges have been brought.\n\nEmboldened by Judd, Rose McGowan and a host of other prominent accusers, women everywhere have begun to speak out about the inappropriate, abusive and in some cases illegal behavior they've faced. When multiple harassment claims bring down a charmer like former Today show host Matt Lauer, women who thought they had no recourse see a new, wide-open door. When a movie star says #MeToo, it becomes easier to believe the cook who's been quietly enduring for years.\n\n'WERE WE SUPPOSED TO CALL SOME FANTASY ATTORNEY GENERAL OF MOVIEDOM?' Ashley Judd 49 Actor More Judd says she was sexually harassed by Harvey Weinstein when she was 29 years old. \u2018 We need to formalize the whisper network. It's an ingenious way that we've tried to keep ourselves safe. All those voices can be amplified. That's my advice to women. That and if something feels wrong, it is wrong\u2014and it's wrong by my definition and not necessarily someone else's. \u2019 Weinstein said in a statement he 'never laid a glove' on Judd.\n\nThe women and men who have broken their silence span all races, all income classes, all occupations and virtually all corners of the globe. They might labor in California fields, or behind the front desk at New York City's regal Plaza Hotel, or in the European Parliament. They're part of a movement that has no formal name. But now they have a voice.\n\nII\n\nIn a windowless room at a two-story soundstage in San Francisco's Mission District, a group of women from different worlds met for the first time. Judd, every bit the movie star in towering heels, leaned in to shake hands with Isabel Pascual, a woman from Mexico who works picking strawberries and asked to use a pseudonym to protect her family. Beside her, Susan Fowler, a former Uber engineer, eight months pregnant, spoke softly with Adama Iwu, a corporate lobbyist in Sacramento. A young hospital worker who had flown in from Texas completed the circle. She too is a victim of sexual harassment but was there anonymously, she said, as an act of solidarity to represent all those who could not speak out.\n\nFrom a distance, these women could not have looked more different. Their ages, their families, their religions and their ethnicities were all a world apart. Their incomes differed not by degree but by universe: Iwu pays more in rent each month than Pascual makes in two months.\n\nBut on that November morning, what separated them was less important than what brought them together: a shared experience. Over the course of six weeks, TIME interviewed dozens of people representing at least as many industries, all of whom had summoned extraordinary personal courage to speak out about sexual harassment at their jobs. They often had eerily similar stories to share.\n\nIn almost every case, they described not only the vulgarity of the harassment itself\u2014years of lewd comments, forced kisses, opportunistic gropes\u2014but also the emotional and psychological fallout from those advances. Almost everybody described wrestling with a palpable sense of shame. Had she somehow asked for it? Could she have deflected it? Was she making a big deal out of nothing?\n\n\"I thought, What just happened? Why didn't I react?\" says the anonymous hospital worker who fears for her family's livelihood should her story come out in her small community. \"I kept thinking, Did I do something, did I say something, did I look a certain way to make him think that was O.K.?\" It's a poisonous, useless thought, she adds, but how do you avoid it? She remembers the shirt she was wearing that day. She can still feel the heat of her harasser's hands on her body.\n\nAlyssa Milano 44 Actor More Millions of people responded with the hashtag #MeToo when Milano urged them to post their experiences on Twitter. \u2018 It's affected me on a cellular level to hear all these stories. I don't know if I'll ever be the same. I have not stopped crying. I look at my daughter and think, Please, let this be worth it. Please, let it be that my daughter never has to go through anything like this. \u2019 Tarana Burke 44 Activist More Burke, founder of a nonprofit that helps survivors of sexual violence, created the Me Too movement in 2006 to encourage young women to show solidarity with one another. It went viral this year after actor Alyssa Milano used the hashtag #MeToo. \u2018 Sexual harassment does bring shame. And I think it's really powerful that this transfer is happening, that these women are able not just to share their shame but to put the shame where it belongs: on the perpetrator. \u2019\n\nNearly all of the people TIME interviewed about their experiences expressed a crushing fear of what would happen to them personally, to their families or to their jobs if they spoke up.\n\nFor some, the fear was born of a threat of physical violence. Pascual felt trapped and terrified when her harasser began to stalk her at home, but felt she was powerless to stop him. If she told anyone, the abuser warned her, he would come after her or her children.\n\nThose who are often most vulnerable in society\u2014immigrants, people of color, people with disabilities, low-income workers and LGBTQ people\u2014described many types of dread. If they raised their voices, would they be fired? Would their communities turn against them? Would they be killed? According to a 2015 survey by the National Center for Transgender Equality, 47% of transgender people report being sexually assaulted at some point in their lives, both in and out of the workplace.\n\n'HE SAID IF I EVER WRONGED HIM, HE WOULD HAVE ME KIDNAPPED, HAVE MY EYES GOUGED OUT WITH A BIC PEN AND THROW ME INTO THE HUDSON RIVER.' Selma Blair 45 Actor More After director James Toback denied accusations by dozens of women that he had sexually assaulted them, Blair spoke out about her encounter with him. \u2018 I decided to go on the record when I saw his denial. He called the women liars. But their stories were so similar to mine, and they were such credible women. There was no agenda other than they wanted to share this story, be free of this story. And in a magazine interview, he called the people who said this about him 'c-nts' and 'c-cksuckers.' That was just wrong. And I wanted to give a face to these now more than 300 women who have come out. \u2019 Toback has denied all allegations of harassment.\n\nJuana Melara, who has worked as a hotel housekeeper for decades, says she and her fellow housekeepers didn't complain about guests who exposed themselves or masturbated in front of them for fear of losing the paycheck they needed to support their families. Melara recalls \"feeling the pressure of someone's eyes\" on her as she cleaned a guest's room. When she turned around, she remembers, a man was standing in the doorway, blocked by the cleaning cart, with his erect penis exposed. She yelled at the top of her lungs and scared him into leaving, then locked the door behind him. \"Nothing happened to me that time, thank God,\" she recalls.\n\nWhile guests come and go, some employees must continue to work side by side with their harassers. Crystal Washington was thrilled when she was hired as a hospitality coordinator at the Plaza, a storied hotel whose allure is as strong for people who want to work there as it is for those who can afford a suite. \"Walking in, it's breathtaking,\" she says.\n\nBut then, she says, a co-worker began making crude remarks to her like \"I can tell you had sex last night\" and groping her. One of those encounters was even caught on camera, but the management did not properly respond, her lawyers say.\n\nPlaza Hotel Plaintiffs More From left: Veronica Owusu, Gabrielle Eubank, Crystal Washington, Dana Lewis, Paige Rodriguez, Sergeline Bernadeau and Kristina Antonova filed a suit against New York City's Plaza Hotel for 'normalizing and trivializing sexual assault' among employees there. \u2018 'I am a single mother. I have an 11-year-old daughter, and she's depending on me,' says Lewis, who still works at the hotel to make ends meet. 'My entire life revolves around her. I wasn't really left with the option of leaving. I'm not left with the option of giving up. I want to show her that it's O.K. to stand up for yourself. If you keep fighting, eventually you'll see the sun on the other side.' \u2019 Fairmont Hotels & Resorts, which owns the Plaza, said it takes remedial action against harassment when warranted.\n\nWashington has joined with six other female employees to file a sexual-harassment suit against the hotel. But she cannot afford to leave the job and says she must force herself out of bed every day to face the man she's accused. \"It's a dream to be an employee there,\" Washington says. \"And then you find out what it really is, and it's a nightmare.\" (Fairmont Hotels & Resorts, which owns the Plaza, said in a statement to TIME that it takes remedial action against harassment when warranted.)\n\nOther women, like the actor Selma Blair, weathered excruciating threats. Blair says she arrived at a hotel restaurant for a meeting with the independent film director James Toback in 1999 only to be told that he would like to see her in his room. There, she says, Toback told her that she had to learn to be more vulnerable in her craft and asked her to strip down. She took her top off. She says he then propositioned her for sex, and when she refused, he blocked the door and forced her to watch him masturbate against her leg. Afterward, she recalls him telling her that if she said anything, he would stab her eyes out with a Bic pen and throw her in the Hudson River.\n\nBlair says Toback lorded the encounter over her for decades. \"I had heard from others that he was slandering me, saying these sexual things about me, and it just made me even more afraid of him,\" Blair says in an interview with TIME. \"I genuinely thought for almost 20 years, He's going to kill me.\" ( Toback has denied the allegations, saying he never met his accusers or doesn't remember them.)\n\nMany of the people who have come forward also mentioned a different fear, one less visceral but no less real, as a reason for not speaking out: if you do, your complaint becomes your identity. \"'Susan Fowler, the famous victim of sexual harassment,'\" says the woman whose blog post ultimately led Uber CEO Travis Kalanick to resign and the multibillion-dollar startup to oust at least 20 other employees. \"Nobody wants to be the buzzkill,\" adds Lindsey Reynolds, one of the women who blew the whistle on a culture of harassment at the restaurant group run by the celebrity chef John Besh. (The Besh Group says it is implementing new policies to create a culture of respect. Besh apologized for \"unacceptable behavior\" and \"moral failings,\" and resigned from the company. )\n\nIwu, the lobbyist, says she considered the same risks after she was groped in front of several colleagues at an event. She was shocked when none of her male co-workers stepped in to stop the assault. The next week, she organized 147 women to sign an open letter exposing harassment in California government. When she told people about the campaign, she says they were wary. \"Are you sure you want to do this?\" they warned her. \"Remember Anita Hill.\"\n\nSara Gelser 43 State Senator More After the Oregon state senator accused her fellow legislator Jeff Kruse of sexual harassment, the statehouse launched an investigation and stripped him of his committee assignments. \u2018 We can't pick and choose based on whose political beliefs we believe in. And that means we have to be willing to speak out when it's a member of our own party. \u2019 Kruse said in a statement that he never touched Gelser inappropriately. Anonymous 28 Hospital worker More The mother of two told the HR department at the hospital where she worked that an executive there repeatedly came on to her. \u2018 I thought, What just happened? Why didn't I react? Why couldn't I force words out of my mouth? When I got home, I crumbled. I kept thinking, Did I do something, did I say something, did I look a certain way to make him think that was O.K.? \u2019\n\nTaylor Swift says she was made to feel bad about the consequences that her harasser faced. After she complained about a Denver radio DJ named David Mueller, who reached under her skirt and grabbed her rear end, Mueller was fired. He sued Swift for millions in damages. She countersued for a symbolic $1 and then testified about the incident in August. Mueller's lawyer asked her, on the witness stand, whether she felt bad that she'd gotten him fired.\n\n\"I'm not going to let you or your client make me feel in any way that this is my fault,\" she told the lawyer. \"I'm being blamed for the unfortunate events of his life that are a product of his decisions. Not mine.\" (Mueller said he would appeal.)\n\nIn an interview with TIME , Swift says that moment on the stand fueled her indignation. \"I figured that if he would be brazen enough to assault me under these risky circumstances,\" she says, \"imagine what he might do to a vulnerable, young artist if given the chance.\" Like the five women gathered at that echoing soundstage in San Francisco, and like all of the dozens, then hundreds, then millions of women who came forward with their own stories of harassment, she was done feeling intimidated. Actors and writers and journalists and dishwashers and fruit pickers alike: they'd had enough. What had manifested as shame exploded into outrage. Fear became fury.\n\n'WHEN I TESTIFIED, I HAD ALREADY HAD TO WATCH THIS MAN'S ATTORNEY BULLY, BADGER AND HARASS MY TEAM, INCLUDING MY MOTHER ... I WAS ANGRY.' Taylor Swift 27 Singer-Songwriter More Radio DJ David Mueller groped Swift during a photo op in 2013. She reported him to his radio station, KYGO, and he was terminated. He said her accusations were false and sued Swift. She countersued for $1 and won. \u2018 In that moment, I decided to forgo any courtroom formalities and just answer the questions the way it happened. This man hadn't considered any formalities when he assaulted me ... Why should I be polite? \u2019 Mueller's lawyer did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThis was the great unleashing that turned the #MeToo hashtag into a rallying cry. The phrase was first used more than a decade ago by social activist Tarana Burke as part of her work building solidarity among young survivors of harassment and assault. A friend of the actor Alyssa Milano sent her a screenshot of the phrase, and Milano, almost on a whim, tweeted it out on Oct. 15. \"If you've been sexually harassed or assaulted write 'me too' as a reply to this tweet,\" she wrote, and then went to sleep. She woke up the next day to find that more than 30,000 people had used #MeToo. Milano burst into tears.\n\nAt first, those speaking out were mostly from the worlds of media and entertainment, but the hashtag quickly spread. \"We have to keep our focus on people of different class and race and gender,\" says Burke, who has developed a friendship with Milano via text messages. By November, California farmworkers, Pascual among them, were marching on the streets of Hollywood to express their solidarity with the stars.\n\nWomen were no longer alone. \"There's something really empowering about standing up for what's right,\" says Fowler, who has grown comfortable with her new reputation as a whistle-blower. \"It's a badge of honor.\"\n\nSandra Pezqueda 37 Former Dishwasher More Pezqueda filed a suit alleging that her supervisor at the Terranea Resort, a luxury retreat in South California, pursued her for months. When she rebuffed him, he changed her schedule and cut her hours. \u2018 Someone who is in the limelight is able to speak out more easily than people who are poor. The reality of being a woman is the same\u2014the difference is the risk each woman must take. \u2019 Attorneys for the staffing company that employed Pezqueda deny her allegations. Terranea Resort declined to comment except to say that the suit involves an outside agency. Blaise Godbe Lipman 28 Director More Lipman accused a former agent, Tyler Grasham, of sexually assaulting him when he was 18. Grasham has since been dismissed by his agency and is being investigated by the Los Angeles Police Department. \u2018 I experienced a little bit of victim blaming, victim shaming\u2014people digging into my Instagram and pulling up sexy photos, as if that discredited me from speaking out against sexual violence. And gay men are often highly sexualized in the media, so coming out with a story of sexual assault, especially one that also involved alcohol and maybe drugs, there is an idea that 'Well, did you want it?.' \u2019 Grasham could not be reached for comment. Correction: The original version of this caption incorrectly said Tyler Grasham was Lipman\u2019s agent. Grasham never represented Lipman.\n\nIII\n\nDiscussions of sexual harassment in polite company tend to rely on euphemisms: harassment becomes \"inappropriate behavior,\" assault becomes \u00ad\"misconduct,\" rape becomes \"abuse.\" We're accustomed to hearing those softened words, which downplay the pain of the experience. That's one of the reasons why the Access Hollywood tape that surfaced in October 2016 was such a jolt. The language used by the man who would become America's 45th President, captured on a 2005 recording, was, by any standard, vulgar. He didn't just say that he'd made a pass; he \"moved on her like a bitch.\" He didn't just talk about fondling women; he bragged that he could \"grab 'em by the pussy.\"\n\nThat Donald Trump could express himself that way and still be elected President is part of what stoked the rage that fueled the Women's March the day after his Inauguration. It's why women seized on that crude word as the emblem of the protest that dwarfed Trump's Inauguration crowd size. \"All social movements have highly visible precipitating factors,\" says Aldon Morris, a professor of sociology at Northwestern University. \"In this case, you had Harvey Weinstein, and before that you had Trump.\"\n\nMegyn Kelly, the NBC anchor who revealed in October that she had complained to Fox News executives about Bill O'Reilly's treatment of women, and who was a target of Trump's ire during the campaign, says the tape as well as the tenor of the election turned the political into the personal. \"I have real doubts about whether we'd be going through this if Hillary Clinton had won, because I think that President Trump's election in many ways was a setback for women,\" says Kelly, who noted that not all women at the march were Clinton supporters. \"But the overall message to us was that we don't really matter.\"\n\n'WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO PLAY NICE.' Rose McGowan 44 Artist and Activist More McGowan reached a settlement with producer Harvey Weinstein in 1997 after accusing him of sexually assaulting her in a hotel room. McGowan's decision to speak to the press this year helped expose Weinstein as a serial harasser. \u2018 The number of people sharing their stories with me is so intense, especially since all of this is incredibly triggering for me as well. People forget a lot that there's a human behind this, someone who is very hurt. But that's O.K. It fuels my fire. They really f-cked with the wrong person. \u2019 Weinstein has denied all allegations of non\u00adconsensual sex.\n\nSo it was not entirely surprising that 2017 began with women donning \"pussy hats\" and marching on the nation's capital in a show of unity and fury. What was startling was the size of the protest. It was one of the largest in U.S. history and spawned satellite marches in all 50 states and more than 50 other countries.\n\nSummer Zervos, a former contestant on The Apprentice , was one of roughly 20 women to accuse the President of sexual harassment. She filed a defamation suit against Trump days before his Inauguration after he disputed her claims by calling her a liar. A New York judge is expected to decide soon if the President is immune to civil suits while in office. No matter the outcome, the allegations added fuel to a growing fire.\n\nBy February, the movement had made its way to the billionaire dream factories of Silicon Valley, when Fowler spoke out about her \"weird year\" as an engineer at Uber. \"I remember feeling powerless and like there was no one looking out for us because we had an admitted harasser in the White House,\" Fowler says. \"I felt like I had to take action.\"\n\nBarely two months later, Fox News cut ties with O'Reilly after the New York Times reported that he and the company had spent $13 million to settle claims against him from five women. In October, the Times revealed a sixth settlement, bringing that total to more than $45 million. Wendy Walsh, a psychologist and former guest on the network, was one of the first women to share her story about the star anchor\u2014but she was initially reluctant to go on the record. \"I was afraid for my kids, I was afraid of the retaliation,\" she says. \"I know what men can do when they're angry.\"\n\nEventually she allowed her name to be used. \"I felt it was my duty,\" Walsh says, \"as a mother of daughters, as an act of love for women everywhere and the women who are silenced, to be brave.\"\n\nThe downfall of O'Reilly, who has denied all allegations of harassment, would prove to be just the beginning of the reckoning in media and entertainment. In June, Bill Cosby was brought to trial on charges that he had drugged and sexually assaulted a woman named Andrea Constand, one of nearly 50 women who have accused Cosby of sexual assault over several decades. Although the case ended in a mistrial\u2014it is scheduled to be retried in April\u2014the fact that it happened at all signaled a shift in the culture, a willingness to hold even beloved and powerful men accountable for past misdeeds.\n\nWendy Walsh 55 Former Fox News Contributor More After Walsh and other women accused Bill O'Reilly of sexual harassment, Fox News fired him. \u2018 In the early '90s, as a news anchor, I wore buttoned-up suits, skirts to my knees, sensible shoes. I dipped out of the industry. When I came back, I was put in a sausage dress. The hair got blonder and the cleavage got deeper and the heels higher. Fox had created a sort of Snapchat filter: any woman, even a woman with advanced degrees, would be turned into what looked like an office sex toy. Part of what happened to the women at Fox News started in the makeup room. \u2019 O'Reilly has denied harassing colleagues. Lindsey Reynolds 32 Food-Blog Editor More When she quit her job as social-media manager at the restaurant group of celebrity chef John Besh, Reynolds sent an email to her bosses complaining about the company's culture of sexism. She later filed a complaint with the EEOC. Besh has since stepped down. \u2018 After I sent that email, I burst into tears and felt sick to my stomach and was shaking. I was nobody. I'm just a person from a small town in Texas. I have no money, no power, no social standing. And they have more power and money than I will ever have. I felt extremely vulnerable and scared. Then I heard from women I had never met\u2014they worked as line cooks while I worked in corporate\u2014who had experienced the same toxic culture. \u2019 The company said it is working to enact policies to create a culture of safety and respect. Besh has apologized for 'unacceptable' behavior and 'moral failings,' and resigned.\n\nComplaints at the University of Rochester helped expose harassment in academia. The chief executive of SoFi, the $4 billion lending firm, resigned following a lawsuit over claims of sexual harassment. Then, in early October, the dam finally broke.\n\nOn Oct. 5, the New York Times published the first story to expose Weinstein, one of the most powerful men in Hollywood and a leading Democratic political fundraiser, as a serial sexual predator. The revelation was quickly followed by New Yorker investigations that widened Weinstein's list of accusers and showed the incredible lengths he went to cover his tracks. Weinstein denied the allegations, but the levers that he had long pulled to exert his influence suddenly were jammed. Fellow chieftains refused to defend him. Politicians who once courted him gave away his donations. His company's board fired him.\n\nWithin days, the head of Amazon Studios, an influential art publisher and employees at the financial-services firm Fidelity had all left their jobs over harassment claims. By the end of the month, the list of the accused had grown to include political analyst Mark Halperin, a former TIME employee; opinion-shaping literary critic Leon Wieseltier; and numerous politicians and journalists. The Oscar-winning actor Kevin Spacey was scrubbed from a completed movie.\n\n'IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THEY CRITICIZE ME. I CAN SUPPORT OTHER PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING THROUGH THE SAME THING.' Isabel Pascual 42 Strawberry picker More In the wake of the revelations about Harvey Weinstein, Pascual spoke out at a march in L.A. about being stalked and harassed in order to give voice to her fellow agricultural workers. \u2018 I was afraid. When the man was harassing me, he threatened to harm my children and me\u2014that's why I kept quiet. I felt desperate. I cried and cried. But, thank God, my friends in the fields support me. So I said, Enough. I lost the fear. It doesn't matter if they criticize me. I can support other people who are going through the same thing. \u2019 *Pascual's name was changed to protect her family.\n\nThe response to the Weinstein allegations has shaped the way people view women who come forward. In a TIME/SurveyMonkey online poll of American adults conducted Nov. 28\u201330, 82% of respondents said women are more likely to speak out about harassment since the Weinstein allegations. Meanwhile, 85% say they believe the women making allegations of sexual harassment.\n\nThe movement\u2014and fallout\u2014quickly spread around the world. Michael Fallon, Britain's Defense Secretary, quit the Cabinet after journalist Jane Merrick revealed that he had \"lunged\" at her in 2003, when she was a 29-year-old reporter. In France, women took to the streets chanting not only \"Me too\" but also \"Balance ton porc ,\" which translates roughly to \"Expose your pig,\" a hashtag conceived by French journalist Sandra Muller. In the week after #MeToo first surfaced, versions of it swept through 85 countries, from India, where the struggle against harassment and assault had already become a national debate in recent years, to the Middle East, Asia and parts in between.\n\nLindsay Meyer 31 Entrepreneur More Meyer says that Justin Caldbeck, a venture capitalist who invested in her first company, harassed her. After six other women reported harassment by Caldbeck, he resigned from his firm. \u2018 I wanted it to stop. I wanted to be able to get back to running my company and not have the daily distraction of being constantly emailed, called, text-messaged. That took a lot of energy to deal with and to process and to try to bury\u2014because I didn't want it to be a big deal. For so long, I went around harboring this ridiculous belief that because I was a nonwhite woman in my 20s that somehow it was expected that I would have to be treated this way. And now I see that that is so silly. I am a person with dignity. \u2019 Caldbeck apologized in a statement to the women he 'made uncomfortable.' Juana Melara 52 Housekeeper More Hotel guests have propositioned and exposed themselves to Melara while she was working. \u2018 One time when I was cleaning, a guest asked me if I knew how to massage. I said, 'No, I don't even do it to my husband.' The way he was looking at me wasn't friendly. I rushed to finish the room as fast as I could and get out of there. It's crazy that people think that if they pay for the room, they are paying for sexual service. \u2019 The hotel declined to comment.\n\n\"Suddenly,\" says Terry Reintke, a German member of the European Parliament, who discussed her own harassment in a speech on Oct. 25, \"friends from primary school or women that I know from completely different surroundings that would never call themselves feminists were starting to share their stories.\"\n\nBy November, the spotlight was back on American politicians. A woman named Leigh Corfman told the Washington Post that Roy Moore, the Alabama Republican nominee for the Senate, abused her when she was 14 and he was a 32-year-old assistant district attorney. Nine women have come forward to describe inappropriate encounters with Roy Moore, including several who say he pursued them when they were teenagers. Moore has called the allegations \"false\" and \"malicious.\" \"Specifically, I do not know any of these women nor have I ever engaged in sexual misconduct with any woman,\" he said in late November.\n\n'I'M SURE THE ROAD WILL BE LONG AND DIFFICULT, BUT IT WILL BE POSITIVE IN THE END.' Sandra Muller 46 Journalist More In France, Muller started the Twitter hashtag #BalanceTonPorc (Expose Your Pig), which helped inspire women to march in the streets to protest sexual harassment. \u2018 France is a country of love, but there is love and love, you know? There are ways to approach a woman, and if it's done with respect, it's O.K. Without respect, it's not good. Now if men want your love, they have to ask themselves how to be, how to approach a woman. They are scared. We must restart all relationships from the beginning. We have to cleanse society to find a better way. I'm sure the road will be long and difficult, but it will be positive in the end. \u2019\n\nThe following week, radio host Leeann Tweeden wrote that Minnesota Democratic Senator Al Franken groped her on a USO tour in 2006, before he was in office. Several other women have since come forward with similar harassment allegations against Franken, who has called on the Senate Ethics Committee to investigate his own behavior. On Dec. 5, Michigan Democratic Representative John Conyers resigned amid allegations that he had made sexual advances toward the women on his staff. He has said that the allegations \"are not accurate; they are not true.\"\n\nTexas Republican Representative Blake Farenthold has also found himself in the crosshairs after media reports that he used $84,000 in taxpayer dollars to settle a sexual-harassment lawsuit with a former aide in 2014. Farenthold denies that he engaged in any wrongdoing and has vowed to repay the settlement.\n\n'WHEN TRUMP WON THE ELECTION, I FELT A CRUSHING SENSE OF POWERLESSNESS. AND THEN I REALIZED THAT I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.' Susan Fowler 26 Former Uber Engineer More Fowler's February blog post about the harassment she experienced as an engineer at Uber went viral. Uber then launched an investigation that led to the ousting of its CEO Travis Kalanick and more than 20 other employees. \u2018 When other women spoke out, they were retaliated against. So there were certain things that I thought I could avoid: 'I'm not going to sue, because they'll make me sign a non\u00addisclosure agreement. I'm not going to do press right afterward, because they'll say I'm doing it for attention. I can't have any emotion in my blog. I have to be very, very detached.' And I had to make sure that every single thing that I included in there had extensive physical documentation, so it couldn't be 'he said, she said.' And that's what I did. \u2019\n\nThe accused were both Democrats and Republicans, but the consequences thus far have been limited\u2014and often filtered through a partisan lens. In politics, at least, what constitutes disqualifying behavior seemed to depend not on your actions but on the allegiance of your tribe. In the 1990s, feminists stood up for accused abuser Bill Clinton instead of his \u00adaccusers\u2014a move many are belatedly regretting as the national conversation prompts a re-evaluation of the claims against the former President. And despite the allegations against Moore, both \u00adPresident Trump and the Republican National Committee support him.\n\nThat political divide was revealed in the TIME/SurveyMonkey poll, which found that Republicans were significantly more likely to excuse sexual misdeeds in their own party. The survey found that while a majority of Republicans and Democrats agree that a Democratic Congressman accused of sexual harassment should resign (71% and 74% respectively), when the accused offender was in the GOP, only 54% of Republicans would demand a resignation (compared to 82% of Democrats).\n\n'WHY ARE YOU QUESTIONING THE VICTIM HERE? LET'S FLIP IT. LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT THE PREDATOR IS DOING.' Terry Crews 49 Actor More Crews is suing agent Adam Venit and William Morris Endeavor for sexual assault. Crews says Venit groped him in front of his wife at an industry event. Venit was briefly suspended from the agency. \u2018 People were saying, 'You should have beaten him up.' I'm like, Why is nobody questioning him? Nobody questions the predator. You know why? Because they just expect it. And I expect it. And I just said, 'No more.' Why are you questioning the victim here? Let's flip it. Let's talk about what the predator is doing. \u2019 The agency said it had suspended and demoted Venit, who declined to comment.\n\nAs another election cycle approaches, Americans find themselves trying to weigh one ugly act against another in a painful calculus of transgression. Is a grope caught on camera more disqualifying than a years-ago assault that was credibly reported? What are we willing to forgive or ignore or deny if the violator shares our politics?\n\nIV\n\nIt wasn't so long ago that the boss chasing his secretary around the desk was a comic trope, a staple from vaudeville to prime-time sitcoms. There wasn't even a name for sexual harassment until just over 40 years ago; the term was coined in 1975 by a group of women at Cornell University after an employee there, Carmita Wood, filed for unemployment benefits after she had resigned because a supervisor touched her. The university denied her claim, arguing that she left the job for \"personal reasons.\"\n\nUniversity Professors More University of Rochester professors Celeste Kidd (right) and Jessica Cantlon (left), along with six current and former members of the brain and cognitive sciences department, filed complaints with the university and the EEOC, alleging harassment and retaliation. \u2018 'If they couldn't stop us from talking, they were going to stop every\u00adbody from listening,' says Cantlon. 'The administration went into our emails to try to find pieces of material that they could use to embarrass us or try to make other faculty members angry with us. But eight of us linked arms and continued to pursue the complaint. I think working together was powerful. It was hard to silence all of us.' \u2019 The university has launched an investigation led by former U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White.\n\nWood, joined by activists from the university's human-affairs program, formed a group called Working Women United that hosted an event for workers from various fields, from mail-room clerks and servers to factory workers and administrative assistants, to talk about their own harassment experiences.\n\nIt was a proto-version of the social-media explosion we're seeing today, encouraging unity and reminding women that they were not alone. But even as public awareness about the problem of sexual harassment began to grow, legal and policy protections were almost nonexistent. In the 1970s, most businesses and institutions had no policies on sexual harassment whatsoever, and even egregious complaints were regularly dismissed.\n\n'I ALWAYS THOUGHT MAYBE THINGS COULD CHANGE FOR MY DAUGHTER. I NEVER THOUGHT THINGS COULD CHANGE FOR ME.' Megyn Kelly 47 Journalist More The host of NBC's Megyn Kelly Today and former Fox News anchor called out Bill O'Reilly for claiming that nobody at Fox News had complained about his behavior. She had. In 2016, Kelly revealed that she'd been sexually harassed by former Fox News CEO Roger Ailes. \u2018 I always thought maybe things could change for my daughter. I never thought things could change for me. Never. I believed the system was stacked against women, and the smart ones would understand how to navigate it ... I'm starting to see it so differently. What if we did complain? What if we didn't whine, but insisted that those around us did better? \u2019 Ailes denied Kelly's claims of harassment before he died in May. O'Reilly said he didn't know of any complaint by Kelly.\n\nIn 1980 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the federal agency tasked with enforcing civil rights laws in the workplace, issued guidelines declaring sexual harassment a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. It was a victory, but with caveats: even after sexual harassment became explicitly illegal, it remained difficult to lodge a complaint that stuck\u2014in part because acts of harassment are often difficult to define. What separates an illegal act of sexual harassment from a merely annoying interaction between a boss and his subordinate? When does a boss stop just being a jerk and become a criminal? Because the Civil Rights Act offered no solid legal definition, interpretation has evolved slowly, shaped by judges and the EEOC over the past 37 years.\n\nIn 1991, Anita Hill testified before the Senate committee confirming Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, accusing him of sexual harassment and bringing national attention to the issue. But, she says, \"The conversation was not about the problems in the workplace. It was about the fallout in politics.\"\n\nMore From left: Jane Merrick, journalist; Zelda Perkins, producer; Terry Reintke, Parliament member; Bex Bailey, charity worker. \u2018 Britain's Defense Secretary Michael Fallon quit his Cabinet position after Merrick said he 'lunged' at her when she was a young reporter: 'I think we're all part of this movement. On Twitter, there aren't any country borders, because it's such a powerful thing. There are millions of women who have experienced harassment and assault in every country.\u201d \u2019 Fallon said in a statement that he's 'behaved inappropriately in the past.' Kate Peters for TIME\n\nEven now, the contours of what constitutes sexual harassment remain murky. Some of the recent stories clearly cross the line, like a boss exposing himself to a subordinate or requiring that his researcher sit on his lap. But others feel more ambiguous. Under what circumstances can you ask a colleague about their marriage? When is an invite to drinks alone a bridge too far?\n\nJonathan Segal, a partner at the Philadelphia law firm Duane Morris, who specializes in workplace training, says he hears that confusion in the conversations men are now having among themselves. \"It's more like, 'I wonder if I should tell someone they look nice, I wonder when it's O.K. to give a hug, I wonder when I should be alone with someone in a room,'\" he says.\n\nAmanda Schmitt 30 Art curator More A publisher of Artforum, Knight Landesman, stepped down after Schmitt sued him for sexual harassment. \u2018 The harassment started when I was at the beginning of my career and had just moved to New York City. I was trying to figure out my place in the art world, my place in the city, my place as an adult in the workplace. The harassment began so early, and it was so accepted in the industry. When I finally spoke out publicly, I wondered why I hadn't sooner. I was afraid that I didn't have the strength to make it stop. I don't feel that fear anymore. \u2019 Artforum's other publishers say they took swift action to support Schmitt. Landesman could not be reached for comment. Adama Iwu 40 Lobbyist More Iwu organized an open letter signed by 147 women calling out harassment in California's capital, which launched a state-senate investigation. \u2018 Young women told me about the same men who harassed me years ago. And all I did was participate in the whisper network: 'Here's what you can wear,' 'Here's where you can go,' 'Here's who to avoid.' But you have to address it head on and as a group. It's hard to call 147 women liars. We can't all be crazy. We can't all be sluts. \u2019\n\nThis uncertainty can be corrosive. While everyone wants to smoke out the serial predators and rapists, there is a risk that the net may be cast too far. What happens when someone who makes a sexist joke winds up lumped into the same bucket as a boss who gropes an employee? Neither should be encouraged, but nor should they be equated.\n\nCompanies, meanwhile, are scrambling to keep up. Most large U.S.-based corporations now have fairly complete policies on sexual harassment, and many have anti\u2013sexual harassment training programs and claim to be \"zero-\u00adtolerance workplaces.\" A 2016 EEOC report found that a company's willingness to protect so-called rainmakers\u2014high-performing men like Kalanick, Weinstein and O'Reilly\u2014to be one of the most pernicious reasons C-\u00adsuites and corporate boards overlooked harassment. It doesn't matter how good a company's policy is if its systems are ignored or don't work. \"So much harassment training is like an episode of The Office ,\" says Victoria Lipnic, the acting chair of the EEOC.\n\nIn some instances, sexual-harassment training has even been shown to backfire. In a 2001 study, Lisa Scherer, an associate professor of industrial-organizational psychology at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, found that while training increased knowledge about what constituted sexual harassment, it also sometimes had a corrosive effect on workplace culture. \"What was disturbing was that the males who had gone through training showed a backlash effect,\" she says. \"They said they were less willing to report sexual harassment than the males who had not gone through the training.\"\n\nEmployers are also girding for future allegations and lawsuits. The insurance company Nationwide reported a 15% increase in sales of employment practices liability insurances between 2016 and 2017. And Advisen, which tracks insurance trends, says that EPLI insurance price has increased 30% since 2011, which indicates that more companies are reporting losses.\n\nCorporate boards, wary of alienating female employees and customers and of drawing bad press, have been among the quickest to make changes. Uber, for example, which built its reputation on a willingness to flout norms, used to be a guiding light for small startups. Now nobody is pitching their company as the next Uber, says Fowler. \"There's a shift to, 'We're not disrupting anymore. We're trying to build something that's good for consumers and treats employees fairly.'\" It's a start.\n\nState and local governments have also taken some concrete steps. In October, the Chicago city council passed an ordinance\u00ad requiring hotels to provide panic buttons to employees who work alone in hotel rooms. In Springfield, Ill., lawmakers passed a measure that will allow an investigation into a backlog of sexual-\u00adharassment complaints in the statehouse. In Arizona, pending legislation would void nondisclosure agreements signed by victims of harassment to keep them silent.\n\n'I STAYED ANONYMOUS BECAUSE I LIVE IN A VERY SMALL COMMUNITY. AND THEY JUST THINK USUALLY THAT WE'RE LYING AND COMPLAINERS.' Anonymous 22 Former office assistant More After a co-worker allegedly began kissing and pressing himself on her, this young Native American woman says she felt trapped. Her office had no HR department. She didn't feel her colleagues or family on her small, conservative reservation would believe her. So she quit her job. \u2018 On the reservation, we keep to ourselves and don't really put too much out there. I thought of all the other people that had no voice. They're scared to do something like this because their parents say, 'You're not supposed to do that. You're not supposed to speak up.' \u2019\n\nAt the federal level, the House and Senate have passed new rules requiring members of Congress and their staff to complete mandatory sexual-harassment training. A handful of Senators have also introduced legislation to rein in what are known as mandatory arbitration agreements\u2014legal clauses that can appear in employee contracts that prevent workers from suing their employers in court for any reason, including sexual harassment. Some 60 million American workers are currently bound by them.\n\nV\n\nWe're still at the bomb-throwing point of this revolution, a reactive stage at which nuance can go into hiding. But while anger can start a revolution, in its most raw and feral form it can't negotiate the more delicate dance steps needed for true social change. Private conversations, which can't be legislated or enforced, are essential.\n\nNorms evolve, and it's long past time for any culture to view harassment as acceptable. But there's a great deal at stake in how we assess these new boundaries\u2014for women and men together. We can and should police criminal acts and discourage inappropriate, destructive behavior.\n\nAt least we've started asking the right questions. Ones that seem alarmingly basic in hindsight: \"What if we did complain?\" proposes Megyn Kelly. \"What if we didn't whine, but we spoke our truth in our strongest voices and insisted that those around us did better? What if that worked to change reality right now?\" Kelly acknowledges that this still feels more like a promise than a certainty. But for the moment, the world is listening.\n\n\u2014With reporting by Charlotte Alter and Susanna Schrobsdorff/New York, Sam Lansky/Los Angeles, Kate Samuelson/London, Maya Rhodan/Washington and Katy Steinmetz/San Francisco\n\nCorrection : The original version of this story misstated when the claims settled by Bill O\u2019Reilly and Fox News were first disclosed.

{"label": true, "txt": "James Woods has received a letter that he can now frame and put on his mantel shelf alongside his Emmy and Golden Globe awards.\n\nFrom attorney Kenneth White, the letter states, \"On behalf of my client \u2014 the defendant referred to as 'Abe List' in the lawsuit filed by James Woods \u2014 and my client's surviving family, I acknowledge that they are not aware of any facts to suggest that Mr. Woods has ever been a cocaine addict or used any other drugs.\"\n\nTo earn this, Woods filed a $10 million libel action in July 2015. The target in the lawsuit was an anonymous Twitter user who responded to Woods' conservative politics by suggesting the actor was a \"cocaine addict.\" In filing the lawsuit, Woods wanted to send a message. \"AL, and anyone else using social media to propagate lies and do harm, should take note,\" stated the complaint handled by Michael Weinsten at Lavely & Singer. \"They are not impervious to the law.\"\n\nWoods then beat back an anti-SLAPP motion that attempted to make the argument that the \"cocaine addict\" tweet was \"a constitutionally protected political insult,\" the type made routinely by Woods as \"a well-known part of Twitter's culture of political hyperbole.\"\n\nAn appeal abruptly was cut short when the defendant died. That wouldn't stop Woods. The actor wrote that he hoped the defendant died \"screaming my name,\" adding, \"Learn this. Libel me, I'll sue you. If you die, I'll follow you to the bowels of Hell. Get it?\"\n\nWoods did make some efforts to pursue the defendant's estate, but that's all over now thanks to a settlement. Full terms hasn't been disclosed, but it does include White's letter.\n\n\"To be clear, my client did not intend for his July 15, 2015 tweet about Mr. Woods to be understood as a statement of fact,\" the letter continues. \"He regretted having made the tweet, and further regrets any harm caused to Mr. Woods' reputation by the tweet. His family was not aware of the tweet until after the fact and regrets if any harm came from the tweet being taken literally.\"\n\nWoods is done with this Twitter defamation case, but the tables have turned because he's a defendant in another.\n\nPortia Boulger, an Ohio woman, is suing him for $3 million. She claims he misidentified her as a Nazi on Twitter. Specifically, the Chicago Tribune posted a photograph of a woman at a Donald Trump rally who might have been making a Nazi salute. Other Twitter users asserted it was Boulger, which led Woods to tweet the photograph along with a question: \"So-called #Trump 'Nazi' is a #BernieSanders agitator/operative?\"\n\nThis got retweeted by Donald Trump, Jr.\n\nStill in court over the matter, Woods filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings last month. He argued the case was an attempt to quell his free speech rights.\n\n\"First, Plaintiff's claim for defamation fails as a matter of law because Mr. Woods' allegedly defamatory question is not a statement of fact,\" writes Woods' attorney. \"Nor would a reasonable reader interpret Mr. Woods' question \u2014 seeking clarification \u2014 as inferring any factual content.\"\n\nLater in the Woods' brief, it's argues that the word \"Nazi\" is \"inherently imprecise and subject to myriad subjective interpretations\" and that \"several courts have consistently held that use of the term 'Nazi' is rhetorical hyperbole.\""}

After her doctor got the genetics results, she texted the information to Kylie Jenner, who had asked to be the one to relay the news to Khlo\u00e9 personally.\n\n\u201cI have such anxiety, I don\u2019t know why,\u201d said Khlo\u00e9 while waiting for Kylie\u2019s phone call.\n\n\u201cWhatever is meant to be \u2014 even if it\u2019s it\u2019s a girl, just know that\u2019s what your path is, and that\u2019s fine,\u201d reassured Kim.\n\n\u201cOf course, and I want a girl eventually,\u201d said Khlo\u00e9. \u201cI just want older brothers to like \u2026 we\u2019ve never had older brothers.\u201d\n\nBut even though Khlo\u00e9 was \u201cconvinced\u201d she was having a boy, she found out she\u2019s actually having a girl \u2014 and her initial reaction was pure disappointment.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m having a girl,\u201d she said, looking upset.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay,\u201d said Kim. \u201cI cried when I found North was going to be a girl, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you have your mind made up as to what you\u2019re having \u2026 and then when you find out it\u2019s the complete opposite, it\u2019s just a shock,\u201d said Khlo\u00e9. \u201cI\u2019m like, in a state of shock.\u201d\n\nKhlo\u00e9 then called mom Kris Jenner to share the news, confessing she had been hoping Kylie was lying.\n\n\u201cThat is so amazing,\u201d said Kris, 62. \u201cKhlo\u00e9, the only thing I wanted in life was a boy. Three times. And I got the three of you. But a man is much more attached to a girl. This will be the love of [Tristan\u2019s] life \u2014 no offense to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then I\u2019m going to get jealous,\u201d said Khlo\u00e9. \u201cThen I don\u2019t like that \u2014 I don\u2019t like her.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a bitch,\u201d chided Kris.\n\nOf course, Khlo\u00e9 eventually warmed up to the news \u2014 especially once she got to witness Tristan\u2019s adorable reaction.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll be like, \u2018How\u2019s my princess doing? I just want to check on my two girls,\u2019 \u201d explained Khlo\u00e9. \u201cHe\u2019s so cute about everything. I still feel so bad [about] how I felt [when I found out], but that\u2019s just how I felt. I am getting more excited.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was looking at nurseries for boys and I just think you need like a day or two to let it sink in, and then you get over it,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd honestly, girls stuff is so much cuter anyway, and it\u2019ll be so cute to have a little girl in the stands rooting for her dad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am honestly so excited Khlo\u00e9 is having a girl,\u201d gushed Kim. \u201cI\u2019ve been getting me and Khlo\u00e9 things for our girls, and it\u2019s probably going to be so annoying but they\u2019re all going to have the same things, do the same things, be in the same class.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s so cute,\u201d said Khlo\u00e9. \u201cSee, that makes me excited! \u2026 My life will never be the same in the best way. I\u2019ve kind of been waiting for this for so long, and now it\u2019s finally happening. I\u2019m so excited to see what the next six months are going to bring.\u201d\n\nKim shares her surrogacy journey\n\nMeanwhile, Kim was going through her own unique journey to motherhood: She and Kanye West were expecting their third child via surrogate. (They welcomed daughter Chicago on Jan. 15.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been such a crazy year,\u201d she reflected. \u201cOur surrogate has been amazing, but it has been challenging with all of the media leaks. \u2026 And it just feels weird that my family has no idea what my experience has been like.\u201d\n\nKim decided to bring her surrogate, La\u2019Reina, over to Kris\u2019 house to introduce her to her mom and sisters. Though the KUWTK cameras avoided capturing La\u2019Reina\u2019s face, they showed a sweet moment where she bonded with pregnant Kylie, 20, and Khlo\u00e9. (The three women were just months apart in their pregnancies.) The scene also marked the first time all season that Kylie\u2019s baby bump was clearly visible.\n\nAfter Khlo\u00e9 asked whether being a surrogate was challenging \u201cemotionally,\u201d La\u2019Reina explained that she doesn\u2019t look at it that way.\n\n\u201cBecause I know from the very beginning this is not my baby,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd at the end, my joy and my satisfaction is with whoever I\u2019m having the baby for. \u2026 I know what my job is in all of it. It makes me feel important because I\u2019m like, \u2018Wow, I did something so good. This is beautiful. I would do this again a thousand more times.\u2019 \u201c\n\n\u201cThis is so beautiful,\u201d gushed Kylie. \u201cThis is so amazing. You should be [proud] \u2014 it\u2019s so special.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout you, this wouldn\u2019t have been possible,\u201d added Kris. \u201cSo we can\u2019t say thank you enough.\u201d\n\nBut no one was more grateful than Kim.\n\n\u201cThis experience, going into it, I really didn\u2019t know what to expect because I don\u2019t really know anyone that\u2019s gone through this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was definitely not as easy as I thought it would be, emotionally, but it\u2019s so worth it and our surrogate is such a nice person. My family absolutely loves her and I\u2019m just so grateful.\u201d\n\n\u201cSurrogacy is such a beautiful thing and we\u2019re just so excited to welcome our baby girl,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m so glad that we\u2019re all doing this together. My family and my kids mean everything to me.\u201d"}

That was in that report,\" Tighe said.\n\nThe Church of Scientology also denied Tighe's claims regarding his role with Cruise.\n\nKarin Pouw, from the Church of Scientology International, told Kelly, \"Brendan Tighe was a Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization security guard/night watchman from 2002 to 2009. The 'access' he boasts of having was largely limited to viewing security cameras from a guard booth. He was removed from that position for dereliction of duty.\"\n\nTighe's accusation surrounding Johansson and Cruise is not the first time an alleged dating process for the actor has been rumored. According to a Vanity Fair article published in 2012, Scientology members underwent an audition process to see if they were a suitable match for Cruise. Actress Nazanin Boniadi was reportedly selected and was in a relationship with the actor from November 2004 to January 2005."}

As allegations of sexual misconduct continue to mount, the disgraced film producer\u2019s wife, Georgina Chapman, announced on Tuesday, October 10, that she is leaving him after 10 years of marriage.\n\nNow, the 61-year-old is opening up about the \u201cpain\u201d he caused the British fashion designer, 41, and their two children India, 7, and Dashiell, 4.\n\nCelebrity Splits of 2017\n\n\u201cI sat down with my wife Georgina, who I love more than anything, and we discussed what was best for our family,\u201d he told Us Weekly in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cWe discussed the possibility of a separation and I encouraged her to do what was in her heart. In the end, she made the decision to separate. I understand, I love her and I love our children and hopefully, when I am better, I will be in their lives again.

{"label": true, "txt": "Bravo\u2019s most successful franchise is undeniably the Real Housewives reality series. What fans love the most about this show is that many of the women completely open up their lives to viewers, including their sometimes tumultuous love lives. We\u2019ve watched many relationships come and go over the years as the women have dated (or even married) some pretty interesting characters! From infidelity to incarceration, here are 12 of the shadiest significant others who\u2019ve appeared on the show!\n\n12. John Mahdessian\n\nWe put John Mahdessian in the last spot on this list because he\u2019s never really did anything too terrible to Real Housewives of New York City star Dorinda, aside from getting into a tiff with her and her friends on camera. To be fair, he tried to make up with Bethenny and does seem to treat Dorinda well, but the fighting with the women and showing up drunk at girls\u2019 nights isn\u2019t cool. We\u2019ll give him the benefit of the doubt though because we know Dorinda is not exactly the kind of woman who\u2019d put up with shady business!\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n2\n\n11. Paul \u2018PK\u2019 Kemsley\n\nPaul Kemsley, better known as \u2018PK\u2019 on The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, joined the show alongside his wife, Dorit, in season 7 and he didn\u2019t exactly leave a good impression. Remember Pantygate? It dragged on all season long and caused a ton of drama, but no one in the situation looked worse than PK when he admitted to his wife that he was staring up Erika\u2019s skirt! Even worse, he made a creepy comment that he \u201cdidn\u2019t mind the view\u201d \u2014 gross! While he seems to have learned his lesson and is keeping a lower profile this season, it\u2019ll take a while for him to get back in the audience\u2019s good graces.\n\n3\n\n10. James Marchese\n\nThis New Jersey husband goes down in history as one of the most hated. Not only was he disliked by viewers during their time on the show after he constantly inserted himself in the women\u2019s drama and spoke rudely about other women on the show, but since their departure from the show, he made headlines after he was arrested on an alleged domestic abuse allegation! The charges were later dropped, but the damage to his already suffering reputation was done.\n\n4\n\n9. Slade Smiley\n\nEven his name sounds a little bit slimy. For years Slade was deemed a serial Housewife dater after he engaged in relationships with former RHOC cast members Jo De La Rosa, Lauri Peterson, and now Gretchen Rossi. When he first appeared on the show as Jo\u2019s boyfriend their relationship seemed pretty normal, but after he got laid off from his job (and never really found another one) and started dating Gretchen, the other women began to question his intentions. Tamra and Vicki both alleged that he wasn\u2019t paying child support and he was a mooching money off Gretchen. In addition to all his financial debt, many people alleged he was only dating her to be on TV. Even though we all questioned their relationship at one point or another, these two are still going strong to this day.\n\n5\n\n8. Frank Curtin\n\nIt was pretty devastating to watch former Real Housewives of Orange County stars Frank and Lynne Curtin\u2019s life essentially fall apart on camera, but we also wanted to shake some sense into Frank! While he\u2019s not necessarily a bad person, what he did to Lynne and his family was pretty shady. He lied about some serious financial problems and allowed them to continue living a lifestyle they could not afford until they were literally broke and homeless. He used the excuse that he felt a lot of pressure to provide them with a certain lifestyle, but he also never gave them a chance to change! Not cool, Frank. Not cool.\n\n6\n\n7. Josh Taekman\n\nEntrepreneur Josh Taekman made his RHONY debut in season 6 when his wife Kristen joined the show as a regular cast member. Their first season on the show consisted of a lot of bickering, so when they returned in season 7, they seemed to make a conscious decision to work on their relationship. Sadly, after season 7 wrapped up, Josh\u2019s named showed up in the Ashley Madison leak. After vehemently denying his involvement, Josh eventually admitted guilt, although he continued to maintain it was only created as a \u201cjoke.\u201d Yeah, right. He\u2019d accessed the account on several different occasions over a three year period, spent more than $1,500 on a membership annually, and even accessed the account while his wife was pregnant!\n\n7\n\n6. Mario Singer\n\nFor six seasons on The Real Housewives of New York City, Ramona and Mario Singer seemed like they had the perfect marriage and Ramona never missed a chance to brag about her husband. Little did she know he had been carrying on an affair behind her back! Talk about being shady! Ramona even dished that after she\u2019d taken him back, she caught him once again with his mistress at their house in the Hamptons. Thinking back, Mario was always a little bit shady. He was constantly inserting himself into the women\u2019s drama which is a definite red flag.\n\n8\n\n5. David Beador\n\nWhere do we begin with this Real Housewives of Orange County husband? When David and his wife Shannon first appeared on the show back in season 9 their marriage was clearly strained. We soon found out it was because they were secretly fighting to keep their marriage together after David\u2019s infidelity. Not only is David shady for cheating on his wife, but apparently he did it with someone Shannon knew! After trying to work through their problems, David resorted back to his old ways of treating Shannon poorly. At the season 12 reunion, Shannon announced they were getting divorced and dished on some details about the events leading up to their divorce including when David told Shannon their 17-year marriage only consisted of a \u201ccouple good months.\u201d What a jerk!\n\n9\n\n4. Joe Guidice\n\nUnlike some of the other significant others on this list, Joe Guidice hasn\u2019t cheated on his wife\u2026that we know of. It\u2019s certainly been alluded to on numerous times on the show, but there\u2019s never been any proof of it and both he and Teresa have vehemently denied these rumors. What\u2019s shady about Joe is that according to Teresa, he lied about their financial troubles for years. While we\u2019ve seen this happen before (remember Lynne and Frank Curtin?), the Giudice\u2019s financial problems were so bad it landed them both in jail! In the most recent season of The Real Housewives of New Jersey, Teresa opens up about how she\u2019s still grappling with how to forgive her husband\u2019s actions.\n\n10\n\n3. Tom D\u2019Agostino\n\nMany fans of Real Housewives of New York City might not remember this but Tom D\u2019Agostino has been lurking around ever since season 1 when he was filmed flirting with Ramona Singer. Tom made a reappearance in season 8 when he struck up a relationship with LuAnn de Lesseps. Their romance moved extremely fast and before we knew it these two were engaged and planning a wedding! Tom was creepy from the get-go. He was caught making sly remarks about his relationship and other women on camera, but the worst was when he was photographed making out with another woman! Despite all this, LuAnn went through with their marriage. Not surprisingly, they got divorced after less than a year.\n\n11\n\n2. Apollo Nida\n\nThere\u2019s no denying Real Housewives of Atlanta star Phaedra Parks knew what she was getting into when she married Apollo Nida; after all, he\u2019d recently been released from prison! Of course, when she first married him she thought his criminal behavior was behind him. While starring on the show, Apollo flirted with other women, got in a physical altercation with someone, threatened Phaedra verbally and even once by approaching her with a drill in his hand, and to top it all off, he was sentenced to another eight years in prison for bank fraud.\n\n12\n\n1. Brooks Ayers\n\nBrooks Ayers lands in the number one spot on this list because he told lie after lie after lie. Unlike the other men on this list who were sometimes pretty forward with their flaws, Vicki Gunvalson\u2019s ex-boyfriend pretended to be this sweet Southern gentleman when really he was a total con-artist. Brooks falsified medical documents to make people believe he was suffering from cancer when really he was perfectly healthy! He was also accused of using Vicki for her money, not having a job and not paying child support. After so many ups and downs over several years, Vicki finally dumped him when she learned he lied about having cancer. That\u2019s definitely a deal breaker."}
{"label": true, "txt": "Madison Kocian and Kyla Ross watched the women they won Olympic gold with step forward one by one over the last 18 months to detail their abuse at the hands of disgraced former USA Gymnastics national team doctor Larry Nassar.\n\nThe more their Olympic teammates talked, the more Kocian and Ross began to examine their own interactions with Nassar. Over time they realized their experience mirrored those of hundreds of other women who were abused by Nassar under the guise of treatment. They realized they hadn\u2019t been spared but instead were victims, too.\n\nIt took months for them to process and even longer to go public. Yet they\u2019re doing it now months after Nassar was sentenced to an effective life sentence after being convicted of federal child pornography and state sexual abuse charges to both help themselves heal and to send a message to victims of sexual abuse everywhere that there is no timetable on coming to grips with the trauma and it\u2019s never too late to speak up and say \u201chey, me too\u201d.\n\n\u201cEveryone copes in their own way,\u201d said Ross, a member of the Fierce Five that stormed to gold at the 2012 Olympics.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how old you are and what happens to you. I\u2019ve come to the point in my life this is something I want to share my story and move on,\u201d Ross told the Associated Press.\n\nRoss and Kocian, a member of the Final Five that won team gold at the 2016 Olympics, have retired from elite gymnastics and now compete collegiately as teammates at UCLA. They both say they were in denial about their abuse. The turning point came in January as they watched nearly 200 women come forward to read victim impact statements to Nassar.\n\nThe group included Jordyn Wieber, who competed alongside Ross at the 2012 London games and now serves as an assistant coach with the Bruins. Until she stood in front of Nassar, Wieber had never spoken publicly about her abuse. Ross and Kocian both leaned on her before deciding to join the army of survivors.\n\n\u201cJust seeing the process through her view had helped me find my voice and be confident in myself and realize I was a victim,\u201d Ross said. \u201cBut we don\u2019t want to be viewed as victims. This is something we have to grow through. Now we\u2019re just trying to find our voice and help.\u201d\n\nAll five members of the 2012 Olympic team Ross, Wieber, Aly Raisman, Gabby Douglas and McKayla Maroney have revealed they were abused by Nassar. Kocian is the fourth member of the 2016 Olympic team to come forward, joining Raisman, Douglas and Simone Biles. Ross and Kocian have both filed civil lawsuits against Michigan State where Nassar worked for decades and plan to do the same against the United States Olympic Committee and USA Gymnastics.\n\nThey place part of the blame for their abuse on what they described as a toxic culture around the USA Gymnastics elite program that allowed Nassar\u2019s treatment to run unchecked.\n\nRoss described getting a \u201cpit\u201d in her stomach every time she visited the Karolyi Ranch near Houston that served as the longtime training home for the senior national team. Kocian felt she and her teammates were \u201cvoiceless\u201d thanks in part to the tone set by former national team coordinator Martha Karolyi. Karolyi retired in 2016.\n\n\u201cYou live under a fear of not being able to speak up because this was our only avenue to accomplish our dreams and make the Olympic team,\u201d Kocian told the AP.\n\nBoth women, now 21, stepped away from elite competition following the 2016 Olympics. While there has been significant change within USA Gymnastics over the last two years, including a new president and board of directors, they\u2019d like to see more.\n\n\u201cThere are still people at the top that I feel have overseen this issue for a long time and I think that needs to be changed as well as the whole culture around everything,\u201d Kocian said. \u201cI don\u2019t think enough has been changed from the coaching standpoint. There are still coaches under that abusive style of coaching whether it\u2019s verbal abuse, that\u2019s what enables all of this.\u201d\n\nUSA Gymnastics said in a statement it is \u201cheartbroken\u201d that Ross and Kocian are among Nassar\u2019s victims, adding \u201ctheir powerful voices and stories will continue to be a basis for our future decisions.\u201d\n\nKocian or Ross, who helped UCLA to an NCAA title last spring, have no plans to return to elite competition. Kocian described a lack of empathy from USA Gymnastics throughout her career as part of the problem.\n\n\u201cPossibly if maybe more people had reached out to my parents to see if I was OK when so many people knew about this and they went through whole Olympic Games knowing and not doing anything,\u201d Kocian said. \u201cEven to this day have heard nothing support wise from them. I think my decision might have been different (otherwise).\u201d"}

It might have been fun for us but not for the team behind the hit HBO series.\n\nIn order to prevent something like this happening again, the Emmy Award-winning show has taken extreme measures this year. Code names, secret sets, disappearing scripts \u2014 Game of Thrones has gone to great lengths to keep secrets for its upcoming final season.\n\nAccording to E Online!, rumour had it that multiple endings were being shot to throw off spoiler spies, but starlet Maisie Williams denied anything remotely close to happening on her appearance on the Jimmy Kimmel Live show.\n\n\u201cWell, I heard this, and I immediately thought, \u2018I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve got the budget to shoot lots of different endings\u2019,\u201d Williams said.\n\nHowever, Williams\u2019 co-star and onscreen sibling, Sophie Turner revealed what actually happened to keep the secrets of season eight. Turner confirmed the reports of self-destructing scripts (they wouldn\u2019t blow up, this isn\u2019t a movie), but said \u201cit\u2019s all true.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, we wouldn\u2019t get anything physical. We would have it on an app. We would get sent sides for the scenes we were shooting the next day. So we would have to learn it all the day before,\u201d Turner told Digital Spy. \u201cAnd once you\u2019d read it, it disappeared 24 hours later, and you could never access it again. It\u2019s tighter than the White House security!\u201d\n\nTurner\u2019s comments support what Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who plays Jaime Lannister on the show, had previously said about the scripts. \u201cThey\u2019re very, very strict. It\u2019s reached a crazy level this year,\u201d he revealed to Esquire. \u201cWe actually get the scripts and we shoot the scene but we only have it digitally and when you\u2019ve done the scene, it just vanishes. It\u2019s like Mission: Impossible\u2026\u2018This will self-destruct\u2019.\u201d\n\nNot just this but visitors on the set would be asked to cover their phone cameras to avoid any pictures being taken. Also, the cast had code names as well, Turner revealed, so that nobody would know who was really on set that day. The show itself also had a code name too: Face of Angels.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a random one!\u201d the actor had said.\n\nAs for the ending, Coster-Waldau said he was satisfied. \u201cI also know that we end the right way and the show ends on its own terms,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I read the scripts for the last season I was like, \u2018Wow, they really pulled it off\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe cast has been paying tribute to the series as production comes to an end. Williams recently marked the end of filming with a bloody Instagram post, Turner got a tattoo to commemorate her time on the series and Emilia Clarke penned an emotional note to Belfast, the country they filmed in.\n\nGame of Thrones returns to HBO in 2019.\n\nHave something to add to the story?

{"label": true, "txt": "Brie Bella, WWE wrestler and star of both Total Divas and Total Bellas , shared last year that she produced more breast milk than she needed after having her daughter, Birdie\u2014so much so, that she donated her extra milk to help babies at her local hospital. But now, Bella revealed that she eventually struggled to produce as much milk as she used to.\n\n\u201cMy breast milk\u2019s taken a huge dip,\u201d she said at a breastfeeding support group, as seen in a sneak peek from Wednesday\u2019s episode of Total Divas.\n\n\u201cI used to have enough where I donate. And now I\u2019ve realized in the last month that I can\u2019t even keep up with her during the day so I\u2019ve had to introduce one bottle of formula a day,\" she continued. \"I\u2019m trying to pump and do all this stuff, but it\u2019s the stress\u2014I hate pumping, to the point it makes me feel bad when I\u2019m doing it because I\u2019m so miserable.\u201d\n\nBella also said in the clip that she struggled with \u201cmom guilt\u201d over her milk production, adding that it\u2019s \u201cthe worst feeling in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought pumping could balance Birdie and my job but it\u2019s not working,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s weird how you just constantly feel like you\u2019re failing.\u201d\n\nYour breast milk usually works on a \"supply and demand\" schedule. So if there's less demand, the supply will go down as well.\n\nFor instance, \"if the baby starts sleeping through the night or if mom is back to work and not breastfeeding or pumping as much as she was, milk supply can drop,\" Diane L. Spatz, Ph.D., a professor of perinatal nursing at the University of Pennsylvania and nurse researcher at The Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, tells SELF.\n\nOr, \u201cif the baby drinks less milk, or formula is introduced instead of breast milk, the supply can dwindle,\u201d Joan Younger Meek, M.D., R.D., chairwoman of the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Breastfeeding and associate dean for Graduate Medical Education at Florida State University College of Medicine, tells SELF.\n\nCertain medications, like hormonal birth control , can also affect your milk supply, as can fatigue or stress, Joanne Goldbort, Ph.D., R.N., a breastfeeding researcher and assistant professor in the College of Nursing at Michigan State University, tells SELF. And if you get your period when you're nursing, you may also see a drop in your milk supply during that time, Spatz says.\n\nBabies can also go through growth spurts when they want to nurse more, and it can seem like you\u2019re not producing as much when your baby feeds, but your body may simply be adjusting your milk supply to try to meet your baby\u2019s needs, Dr. Meek says.\n\nOn the flip side, if the demand can't keep up with the supply, you'll eventually produce less milk.\n\nFor instance, some people might get a little \u201cpump happy,\u201d overstimulate their breasts, and create a safety net of excess milk, Leigh Anne O'Connor , IBCLC, a La Leche League Leader, tells SELF. That sounds great, but it can actually mess with your milk production in the long run. They may use that stored milk to feed their baby and not realize that they also still need to continue pumping and stimulating the breasts to keep up milk production, she explains.\n\nAnd if you have an oversupply, the milk may also flow so easily that your baby doesn\u2019t really need to suck hard to get to your milk, O\u2019Connor says. \u201cOver time, the baby who has been riding the wave of oversupply does not stimulate the breasts, and this lack of stimulation will send a signal to the breasts to slow down milk production,\u201d she explains.\n\nIf you\u2019re having any difficulties with your milk supply, it\u2019s a good idea to talk to your child\u2019s pediatrician as well as a breastfeeding expert.\n\nEven if you think you're not producing enough milk, it's important to have your child\u2019s pediatrician help you gauge how your baby is growing to see whether or not they\u2019re actually getting the milk they need, Dr. Meek says.\n\nA breastfeeding expert or lactation specialist can also help figure out how much milk is getting to your baby during feedings. \u201cTogether, they can develop a feeding plan that is best for mom and baby, which may involve use of infant formula in some cases,\u201d Dr. Meek says. Sometimes formula is used in the short term while the mom tries to increase her supply, sometimes it\u2019s used to help the baby gain weight, and sometimes a mom may choose to replace a feeding with formula, she says. Other times, a mom may decide to switch to formula altogether .\n\nAnd, obviously, breastfeeding can be incredibly emotional, which is where a lactation consultant or breastfeeding support groups really come in handy. \u201cSupport groups can be very helpful to allow the mom to talk about how she is feeling about breastfeeding with other mothers,\u201d Dr. Meek says. \u201cMost lactation consultants are good about counseling mothers as well.\u201d\n\nTo find a breastfeeding consultant or support group near you, check in with the hospital where you delivered, La Leche League International , or the International Lactation Consultant Association has an online directory . Above all, if breastfeeding isn't coming easily, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out for help\u2014there are a lot of options available.\n\nRelated:"}

The purge seems like an abrupt decision from the social media star, since she's openly shared footage of her daughter to her millions of followers on Instagram and Snapchat in the past few months.\n\nJenner didn't give any clear reason for her decision. It may have to do with media pressure, too many unwarranted comments, or simply just wanting a little bit of privacy.

This year, the Taylor Swift \"Look What You Made Me Do\" costumes will be legion \u2014 remember the many, many Ballerina Swifts of 2015? \u2014 but a lack of originality doesn't mean you should dress up as some lesser pop star. Swift costumes will never go out of style.\n\nAlthough it may feel like the massively popular 1989 came out just a short while ago, it has actually been three years since the release of Swift's last album. Needless to say, fans were delighted when she announced via Instagram in late August that her newest album will be released this fall. Reputation, stylized in the lowercase as reputation, is her sixth studio album, and if the popularity of 1989 is any indication, everyone in the Western hemisphere can expect to have it memorized by the end of November.\n\nThe album itself isn't scheduled for release until Nov. 10, but by the end of September, Swift released two singles: \"...Ready For It?\" and \"Look What You Made Me Do.\" Anyone with the barest awareness of pop culture already knows that the latter song was accompanied by an instantly iconic music video featuring Swift throughout the ages.

(Subtle, right?) Of all the costumes, it's the most appropriate for Halloween, so it's perfect for horror aficionados. The most important part is the zombie makeup; there are plenty of online tutorials to practice before Oct. 31. Aside from that, all you need is a dirty blue dress and a shovel. Be sure to use cocoa powder on your skin to make yourself look appropriately grimy.

{"label": true, "txt": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will officially be tying the knot at St. George's Chapel in...\n\nDeal or No Deal\n\n...and each and every week, ET will be breaking down all the latest updates as they gear up for their May 19 nuptials.\n\nBIGGEST NEWS OF THE WEEK\n\nWhile there was plenty of royal news that flooded our inboxes this week, we were most excited about getting an update on Meghan's wedding dress! We already knew that she had selected a dress designer (thanks to her stylist-turned-pal, Jessica Mulroney), but now we know what she'll be wearing on her special day is officially in the design process!\n\nA source told ET earlier this week that Meghan has already met with the dress designer, and is busy adding unique touches to the couple's big day.\n\nWe also found out that the Los Angeles native has been appointed a secretary to handle her increasingly busy royal schedule and duties. Amy Pickerill, a former Kensington Palace press officer, was announced on Monday as the new assistant private secretary in the office of Prince Harry.\n\nAs for Meghan and Prince Harry's actual wedding day, expect a lot of security. Ken Wharfe, the late Princess Diana's former bodyguard, told ET on Thursday that police will make sure nothing is overlooked for the massive occasion, and no expense will be spared.\n\n\"From my own experiences -- and speaking to colleagues within the last few weeks -- Scotland Yard and neighboring police forces that will be part of this operation will be only too aware of how important it is to make sure that no stone is left unturned, and you know, one talks in this day of austerity of finance,\" he said. \"Trust me on this occasion, finance has nothing to do with this. Scotland Yard, together with Thames Valley Police -- which will be policing this event -- money is not an object, and they make sure that the very best of security is put on display to make sure that security is not compromised.\"\n\nAnd after the soon-to-be-married couple's anthrax scare last Monday, we wouldn't be surprised if there's even more heightened security as they continue their royal duties ahead of their nuptials.\n\nROYAL RUMOR ROUNDUP\n\nLooks like Megan and Kate Middleton have been spending even more quality time together! The former Suits star often goes from her Nottingham Cottage to Kate's humble abode to have tea or exchange advice, according to US Weekly.\n\n\u201c[Meghan] shares tips she\u2019s read about healthy eating,\" a source told the publication.\n\nAnd while it's not a rumor, it seems as if people are comparing Meghan to Princess Diana more and more frequently. According to multiple reports, the bride-to-be has been making secret visits to comfort victims of the Grenfell Tower, much like when Diana would also sneak away from Kensington Palace to visit hospital patients.\n\n\"Meghan's visits mean so much to us. She has a special place in our hearts,\" one community member, who met the soon-to-be-royal, told E!\n\nOUT AND ABOUT\n\nAfter making a trip to Scotland, Meghan and Harry took a break from the spotlight this week -- but did have time for a fun date night.\n\nThe engaged couple attended a Hamilton show at the Victoria Palace Theatre in London's West End last Friday night. One of the show's cast members, Leslie Garcia Bowman, even took to Twitter to express his excitement over having the couple in attendance.\n\nWas an honour to have Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in to watch @HamiltonWestEnd last night! \u2014 Leslie Garcia Bowman (@lesliegbowman) February 17, 2018\n\nSERVIN' UP SUITS\n\nIf you've been following along with our royals countdown each week, then you're well aware that we've been binge-watching Meghan's show, Suits, since the beginning. This week, we were super happy to see Meghan, who plays aspiring lawyer Rachel Zane, try on an Anne Barge wedding gown during the \"Cold Feet\" episode of season 5.\n\nWhen the episode originally aired on the USA network last year, Meghan spoke with Glamour, revealing some of her personal favorite bridal styles.\n\n\"Delphine Manivet and Christos Costarellos are faves of mine for their uniqueness and beauty,\" she gushed at the time. \"I will always be a fan of Ellie Saab. J. Mendel is spectacular as well, especially for more structural designs.\"\n\nWatch Meghan model her character's wedding dress in the video below:\n\nSPARKLE LIKE MARKLE\n\nBecause our muscles are still kinda hating us from trying Meghan's favorite Pilates class last week (more on that HERE), we decided to take it easy this time by having a \"treat yourself\" night. We sat back, relaxed and drank like Meghan. Yes, turns out, girl loves a good wine!\n\n\"God, do I love wine; a beautiful full red or a crisp white,\" she revealed in an interview with The New Potato in 2013. \"But if it\u2019s cocktails, I love a spicy tequila cocktail, negroni, or good scotch (neat).\"\n\nShane Mahood/USA Network/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images\n\nRATHER REGAL LOOKS\n\nThe queen-to-be truly shined! The seven-month pregnant Duchess of Cambridge looked exquisite at the 2018 BAFTAs, Britain's equivalent to the Oscars, on Feb. 18.\n\nThe expecting mother donned a dark green Jenny Packham gown with cap-sleeves and a black ribbon to accentuate her baby bump. Kate accessorized her regal look with emerald and diamond earrings and a matching necklace.\n\nWPA Pool/Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nNEXT IN LINE\n\nOnto Prince William and, of course, more Kate!\n\nThe Duchess began her week alongside Sophie Countess of Wessex, by hosting the Commonwealth Fashion Exchange reception at Buckingham Palace. The brunette beauty arrived wearing a black-and-white floral print Erdem lace dress with black heels, and talked to designers and artisans from around the Commonwealth about their work.\n\nDominic Lipinski - Pool/Getty Images\n\nMeanwhile, the Duke of Cambridge proved he's the coolest dad around town, taking a spin on a motorcycle during his trip to Triumph Motorcycles and MIRA Technology Park in Warwickshire on Feb. 20. Rocking a sleek black motorcycle jacket, he took a test drive on a red Triumph Tiger 1200.\n\nThe Duke test-drives the latest Triumph Tiger 1200. pic.twitter.com/Igul53lui4 \u2014 Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) February 20, 2018\n\nBoth William and Kate continued their royal duties the following day by paying a visit to the Fire Station Sun, one of Sunderland, England's most iconic buildings. There, they put on hard hats and reflective vests as they ventured to the Northern Spire, a new bridge over the River Wear that is scheduled to open later this year.\n\nChris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nQueen Elizabeth II also had quite the interesting week! Her Majesty graced fashionistas with her presence at London Fashion Week, where she presented the inaugural Queen Elizabeth II Award for British Design to Richard Quinn. The 91-year-old head of the monarchy looked enthusiastic as she sat front row next to Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour at the emerging British designer's runway show.\n\nQueen Elizabeth was sophisticatedly dressed in a powder blue Angela Kelly skirt and matching jacket with black gloves and a chic handbag.\n\nYui Mok - Pool/Getty Images\n\nLastly, what we've all been waiting for will finally happen. The Fab Four -- Kate, William, Meghan and Harry -- will all attend the first annual Royal Foundation Forum on Wednesday. And you can bet we'll be going all out for the royal couple's first engagement together since Christmas!\n\nAnd that's a wrap on your weekly royals update.

It looked like it was going to take months more.\u201d\n\nMeek was permitted specific visiting times and phone calls by officials at the jail in Chester, and the Supreme Court notified his legal team of his bail outside of these permitted hours on Tuesday, so supporters couldn\u2019t reach him with the good news.\n\nMeek said of the moment he learned of his freedom, \u201cI was in my cell and I was watching the news, and they said I\u2019m free. I immediately said a quick prayer, and got ready to go.\u201d\n\nHe added that he still had work to do to get his original conviction overturned, given that it was based on the evidence of an alleged corrupt cop, and to shine a light on others trapped in a failing criminal justice system.\n\nBut for tonight, he was ready to celebrate at the 76ers game. \u201cWe are on to see the Sixers game, and its going to be a big night for Philly. The team is going to advance, and I came home.\u201d\n\nHe said his greatest joy will be to be reunited with his 6-year-old son, Papi, who he has barely seen during his five months in jail, because he didn\u2019t want him to see his dad in jail. Papi had been seen at a previous rally holding up a sketch of his father that read \u201cFree Meek Mill\u201d and adorably told a reporter, \u201cI miss my dad very much.\u201d\n\nMeek explained, \u201cI am going to watch the game with my son and my family tonight. I can\u2019t wait to see my son, it\u2019s his birthday on May 13 and he had been asking how we were going to celebrate. When I was in jail I couldn\u2019t give him an answer, I didn\u2019t know what to say to him, but now I\u2019m going to be spending all this time with him.\u201d\n\nMeek added he also wanted to take the time to thank all the supporters, fans and friends who have campaigned for his release, and promised to fight to change the criminal justice system that keeps innocent people in jail, and to also help others in his situation that do not have the same resources to fight for their freedom."}

She owned up to the tweets -- which included racist comments, fat-shaming remarks, using the R-word, and seemingly even slamming The Bachelor -- on Friday, alongside an apology.\n\n\"I want to start by expressing my sincerest apologizes for the extremely hurtful words that I said many years ago,\" Shapoff wrote on Instagram. \"I'm so sorry for those who I have offended. I am beyond mortified that I ever had those thoughts and then proceeded to express them. By no means does this reflect the person who I am today. To the people who do not know me, I am a loving, kind, thoughtful, generous, and compassionate woman. I am not mean-hearted or hurtful.\"\n\n\"The people I have always surrounded myself with are very diverse and come from all over the world,\" she continued. \"I have a huge heart and a very open mind. In the many years since writing those tweets, I have made a conscious effort not to be judgmental and to be accepting of all people. I have gone into a field of work where I am able to help women and men have positive images of themselves, their bodies, and feel beautiful in who they are. It is the most rewarding feeling being able to work in such a diverse field. It shows me the beauty in all people and I am so lucky to have this opportunity.\"\n\nShapoff concluded by insisting that she doesn't \"defend any of the words I have tweeted.\" \"I just want to deeply apologize and learn from my mistakes. I wholeheartedly reject all of those sentiments,\" she said. \"That being said, I take full responsibility for my tweets and will use this as a learning experience. I hope that we can continue to spread love and kindness in the world.\"\n\nABC has no comment.\n\nSocial media scandals have been a recurring theme for the Bachelor franchise lately. One of the contestants on Rachel Lindsay's season of The Bachelorette in 2017, Lee Garrett, was discovered to have a large history of racist tweets. Host Christ Harrison called him out on the show's Men Tell All special, and he apologized for his remarks.\n\nThen on Becca Kufrin's season of The Bachelorette earlier this year, her final pick, Garrett Yrigoyen, owned up to having liked Instagram posts which mocked transgender people, feminists, immigrants and Parkland shooting survivors. He apologized for his actions in an Instagram statement weeks after the scandal came to light, and clarified his views to ET after the show's finale.\n\n\"I'm just open-minded to everybody,\" he said in response to the anti-transgender memes he liked, noting that he grew up in a very welcoming family. \"I'm open and accepting to everybody.\"\n\nHe also opened up about the meme he liked that called David Hogg and other Parkland shooting survivors crisis actors. \"I don't believe David Hogg is a crisis actor. No, I don't,\" he added.\n\nSee more in the video below.\n\nThe Bachelor returns with a three-hour live premiere on Monday, Jan. 7 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC -- join ET's Bachelor Nation Facebook group here.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\n'Bachelor' Colton Underwood's Contestants Revealed!

{"label": true, "txt": "The real winner of the 2018 Golden Globes had nothing to do with the films or television series up for awards. Oprah Winfrey\u2014the talkshow host, philanthropist, producer, actress and businesswoman\u2014stole the show with a moving and cohesive speech that touched on everything from racial equality to press freedom to sexual harassment and brought tears to the star-filled audience.\n\nWinfrey\u2014whose unsurpassable compassion and relatability has brought her both incredible fame and fortune\u2014made the memorable speech as the first African American woman to ever accept the Cecil B. DeMille Award, honoring her contributions to the world of entertainment. (With a net worth of $2.8 billion, Winfrey is the only billionaire to have, herself, won an award, though Steven Spielberg, worth $3.6 billion, was nominated, and Jeff Bezos, worth $103 billion, was likely celebrating the many wins of Amazon Studio's The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.)\n\nFollowing her acceptance, Winfrey headed backstage to answer questions posed by various members of the press. Her answers demonstrated the same balance of justifiable frustration and hope that her speech did and further addressed the Time's Up movement, while also turning to her personal journey\u2014and, of course, including some of that Oprah Winfrey wisdom.\n\nWhat is the greatest lesson you\u2019ve learned throughout your life and career?\n\n\"The greatest lesson I\u2019ve learned throughout my career came from Maya Angelou actually. After I\u2019d known her for a while, she said, \u2018Baby, you know, you need to know that when people show you who they are, you believe them the first time. And your problem is that it takes you 29 times.' I that has been one of my greatest wisdom-teachings: to assess from people\u2019s behavior\u2014their actions not just towards me, but towards other people\u2014who they are. I think in business and in personal relationships that\u2019s been my greatest lesson. Also staying grounded has been really great for me.\"\n\nWhat humbles you right now?\n\n\"This humbles me! When they first called me and said they wanted me to accept this, I said, \u2018I shouldn\u2019t be the person to get the Cecil B. DeMille Award.\u2019 You know why? I was working with Reese Witherspoon this past spring and winter, and I happened to say in the makeup room one morning, \u2018How many movies have you done?\u2019 She goes \u2018Oh, honey child, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s been so many.\u2019 And I then thought, \u2018I hope she doesn\u2019t ask me, because I think it\u2019s been five.\u2019 So I didn\u2019t understand [the award], and then they explained it\u2019s about overall entertainment.\"\n\nWhat I was able to do with The Oprah Show and the cultural statement we were able to make throughout the world, I feel very, very, very proud of that. But I think that when it comes to films that I am really the new kid on the block. And I always feel that when I\u2019m acting, I am out of my box, and it\u2019s the most intimidated I ever feel.\"\n\nI\u2019m curious what wisdom you can pass on to me and my friends? We are film school scholarship recipients of the Hollywood Foreign Press. What wisdom can you pass on to the future generation here in Hollywood that wants to make movies?\n\n\"The way to make movies is to do stuff that you love because for 25 years I worked on The Oprah Show, and, Stedman will tell you, there were nights I came home and it was hard to even take off my clothes because I knew I was going to be getting up four hours later. I felt exhausted, but I never really felt depleted.\n\nDo the work that comes straight from the soul of you\u2014from your background, from stories that you\u2019ve grown up with, from stories that bring you passion, from stories that you not just yearn to tell, but that if you don't tell them, they won\u2019t get told.\n\nThe single greatest wisdom I think I\u2019ve ever received\u2014other than when people show you who you are\u2014is that the key to fulfillment, success, happiness, contentment in life is when you align your personality with what your soul actually came to do. I believe everybody has a soul\u2014has their own personal, spiritual energy\u2014so when you can use your personality to serve whatever that thing is, you can\u2019t help but be successful. So if you do films that come from the interior of your soul\u2014you do work, you do art\u2014that comes from the interior of you, you cannot miss.\n\nIt\u2019s only when you\u2019re doing stuff that you think may make money, you think may be a hit or you think may bring you some level of attention or success, that isn\u2019t what does it. I would have to say that all of the great, wonderful experiences of my life that have brought me to this moment, have come from working from the interior of myself. And so that\u2019s why it feels so authentic, because it actually is. So when you do that, you\u2019ll win.\"\n\nWhat advice would you give to seven-year-old Oprah about being a woman surviving in this world?\n\n\"At seven, I was so sad. At seven, all of my real love came from my teachers. I would say this to anyone in this room: You have no idea the power of noticing another human being and what it feels like when someone knows they have been seen\u2014truly seen\u2014by you. It is the greatest offering you can give.\n\nAll those years at The Oprah Show, the greatest lesson I learned, was that after every show, someone would say, invariably, in one way or another, \u201cHow was that?\u201d I\u2019d finish an interview of a father who killed his twin daughters, I\u2019d finish an interview with a politician\u2014Barack Obama, Joe Biden, George Bush\u2014or with Beyonce. They all say the same thing: \u2018How was that?\u2019\n\nSo I started to see that there is this common thread in our humanity where everyone wants to know 'How was that? Did I do okay? Did you hear me? Did what I say mean something to you?'\n\nSo I would say that recognizing that in other people has helped me be able to become a person of compassion, a person of understanding, a person who can interview anybody about anything, because I know that the core of you is the same as the core of me, you just want to be heard.\"\n\nLast year when Meryl Streep won this award, it was a very different time\u2014Trump had just won, and since then we\u2019ve had all of the allegations. With your speech, with everyone in solidarity in black tonight, do you feel that the country together as a whole is moving in a better direction that we moved last year?\n\n\"I always think and know\u2014having watched it over the years, through thousands and thousands of interviews and watching people in their dysfunction\u2014that when something really negative is brewing, that there is the direct opposite reaction that is also possible. For every action, there\u2019s an equal and opposite reaction. So when something as big as what started to happen in October with Harvey Weinstein started to unfold, I though 'Woah, woah, woah.' And with every day\u2019s revelation, I thought, here is an opportunity for a powerful growth, and how do we use this moment to elevate what is happening instead of continuing to victimize ourselves.\n\nSo I think that wearing black in solidarity is one step. I think what Time\u2019s Up is doing with a legal defense fund is a major step. It was very important to all of us involved with Time\u2019s Up that it not just be about the women of Hollywood, because we're already a privileged group, but to extend to the women of the world. As I said tonight, there isn\u2019t a culture, a race, a religion, a politic, a workplace that hasn\u2019t been affected by it. One of the reasons I wanted to tell Recy Taylor\u2019s story is because it's been happening for a very long time\u2014when people didn\u2019t know that they could speak up. There are so many women who have endured so much and remained silent and kept going because there was no other recourse. And now that we've all joined as one voice, I think that it feels like empowerment to those women who have never had it.\""}

{"label": true, "txt": "The sixth and final season of the American political drama web television series House of Cards was confirmed by Netflix on December 4, 2017, and was released on November 2, 2018. Unlike previous seasons that consisted of thirteen episodes each, the sixth season consists of only eight. The season does not include former lead actor Kevin Spacey, who was fired from the show due to sexual misconduct allegations.\n\nProduction [ edit ]\n\nUnannounced start and sudden shutdown [ edit ]\n\nKevin Spacey was fired after sexual assault allegations were made against him.\n\nOn October 11, 2017, The Baltimore Sun reported that House of Cards had been renewed for a sixth season and that filming would begin by the end of October 2017.[1] On October 18, 2017, production of the sixth season of House of Cards appeared to be already in progress, without an official renewal announcement by Netflix, when a gunman opened fire near a House of Cards set outside Baltimore. Production company Media Rights Capital and Netflix stated that production on the show was not impacted by the shooting.[2]\n\nProduction on the series was shut down on October 30, 2017, following actor Anthony Rapp's sexual assault allegation that Kevin Spacey had made a sexual advance on him in 1986, when Rapp was 14 years old. Netflix announced its decision to cancel the series after the upcoming season, although multiple sources stated that the decision to end the series had been made prior to Rapp's accusation.[3][4]\n\nThe following day, Netflix and MRC announced that production on the season would be suspended indefinitely, in order to review the current situation and to address any concerns of the cast and crew.[5] Robin Wright strongly opposed Netflix executives who wanted to cancel the season, as she was concerned about the 2,500 people who had been involved in the production at that time and were at risk of losing their jobs.[6] On November 3, 2017, Netflix announced that they would no longer be associated with Spacey in any capacity whatsoever.[7]\n\nRestarting production [ edit ]\n\nOn December 4, 2017, Ted Sarandos, Netflix's chief content officer, announced that production would restart in 2018 with Wright in the lead, without Spacey's involvement, and revealed that the sixth and final season of the show would consist of eight episodes.[8] House of Cards resumed production on January 31,[9] and wrapped filming four months later, on May 25, 2018.[10]\n\nThe firing of Kevin Spacey significantly affected the production process, as showrunners Frank Pugliese and Melissa Gibson had to rethink the show and come up with a conclusion for the series in a limited amount of time, taking into consideration other contractual obligations of the cast and crew.[11][12] In an interview with IndieWire, Pugliese and Gibson revealed that these changes did not represent a huge shift for many of the characters; it was the overall story that was mostly affected, which was initially intended to center on a struggle between Frank and Claire to own the White House. The showrunners also revealed that\u2014even in his absence\u2014Frank continues to have a big impact on the story, and noted that erasing him completely would have seemed disingenuous.[13]\n\nIn the wake of Spacey's firing, Wright leads the sixth season of House of Cards, with her character, Claire Underwood, having assumed the presidency at the end of the previous season.[14] A number of returning cast members reprised their roles from previous seasons,[15] while Alik Sakharov, who had helmed three episodes in season five, directed for the final season as well.[16] New additions to the cast included Diane Lane and Greg Kinnear, who played Annette and Bill Shepherd, the sister-brother inheritors of an industrial conglomerate; said characters were inspired by the Koch brothers, as members of a family with the power to influence American politics. Joining them, Australian actor Cody Fern plays Annette's ambitious son Duncan Shepherd.[17] Lane had been cast to play Claire\u2019s longtime friend prior to Spacey's firing, with whom she had shot a number of scenes. However, as she told IndieWire, the writers \"managed to find the same trajectory for [her] character in terms of what she means to Claire.\"[13]\n\nCast and characters [ edit ]\n\nMain [ edit ]\n\nRecurring [ edit ]\n\nEpisodes [ edit ]\n\nNo.\n\noverall No. in\n\nseason Title Directed by Written by Original release date Prod.\n\ncode 66 1 \"Chapter 66\" Alik Sakharov Melissa James Gibson & Frank Pugliese November 2, 2018 ( ) HOC-621 It has been 100 days since Claire Underwood took presidential office and Frank Underwood is dead.

He continues his investigation of Catherine Durant's death, discovering that she may still be alive. Hammerschmidt tracks down Rachel Posner's belongings, including a phone number which leads him to Doug. A worker reaches out to Janine claiming to have incriminating information on the Shepherds.

On March 4, the first teaser premiered during the 90th Academy Awards ceremony. The teaser shows Robin Wright in the Oval Office as President Claire Underwood, declaring \"We're just getting started,\" followed by an intertitle reading \"Hail to the Chief\".[19] On June 10, Netflix released two first-look images from the final season. The first photo shows Wright listening to director Alik Sakharov, and the second shows her looking straight at the camera.[20] On July 4, the 242nd anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, a video message was posted on House of Cards' official Twitter account, with President Claire Underwood saying, \"Happy Independence Day... to me.\" The message is followed by the hashtag #MyTurn.[21]\n\nOn August 7, Netflix announced that the season would be released on November 2, 2018, and unveiled key art. The poster pays homage to the promotional image for the first season of the series, as Wright strikes the Lincoln Memorial pose, like Kevin Spacey had done before her.[22] On August 27, four images were published via a press release, which depict new cast members Diane Lane, Greg Kinnear and Cody Fern in their roles as members of the Shepherd family.[23] A teaser trailer released on September 5, revealed the fate of Frank Underwood, portrayed by Spacey who was fired from the show, months after the conclusion of the fifth season. It is shown that Frank died in 2017, and has been buried next to his father in South Carolina. Claire visits her husband's grave and says, \"I'll tell you this though, Francis. When they bury me, it won't be in my backyard. And when they pay their respects, they'll have to wait in line.\" This speech mirrors the one Frank gives in the third season of the series, when he visits his father's grave.[24] On September 27, Netflix released a new teaser trailer that presents several new and returning characters. Claire is shown dealing with the aftermath of her husband's death, and declaring that \"the reign of the middle-aged white man is over.\"[25] On October 8, Netflix released the official trailer for the season, which revolves around Claire's power struggle, as she clashes with the American oligarchs and tries to forge her own path as President of the United States.[26] On October 23, critics began publishing reviews on the season, based on advance copies of the first five episodes that they had received from Netflix, after they had signed a letter of agreement.[27]\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nPrior to the official release date of the season, Netflix sent the first five episodes to a number of critics, to serve as advance screeners. On Rotten Tomatoes, the season has an approval rating of 71% based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 6.19/10. The consensus reads, \"House of Cards folds slightly under the weight of its labyrinthian ending \u2013 thankfully Robin Wright's commanding performance is strong enough to keep it standing strong.\"[28] On Metacritic, the season has a weighted average score of 62 out of 100, based on 21 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[29]\n\nKevin Lever of FilmEra wrote that \"with Wright at the forefront of the show now, House of Cards shines as it did in its early years.\" Lever described the production as \"stellar\" and the writing as \"reinvigorated\". He noted that the show still has the feel of previous years, but it works best when it focuses on Claire, instead of dealing with holdover pieces.[30] David Zurawik of The Baltimore Sun wrote, \"I love TV drama that speaks to the cultural moment the way this series does. And, as I have said over and over, #MeToo is a landmark moment.\" Zurawik revealed that the season primarily focuses on gender issues; the evil of patriarchy and the stench of misogyny. He stated that the episodes exceeded his expectations, and praised the performances of Wright, Lane and Kinnear.[27] Christopher Hooton of The Independent described the episodes as \"slightly banal\". He expressed his disappointment at the new characters that were introduced this season, and commented that \"Frank Underwood has left behind not only a power vacuum but an entertainment one.\" Hooton noted that ever since Frank became president at the end of season two, the series has drifted directionless, and after watching the first five episodes of the final season, it still remains unclear what the show is actually about.[31]\n\nNegative reviews include one by Tyler Coates of Esquire, who writes: \"Kevin Spacey's absence haunts the final season of House of Cards. Just as the show wouldn't work without Claire Underwood, it doesn't exactly work without Frank.\"[32] Another by Sonia Saraiya of Vanity Fair writes: \"House of Cards collapses \u2013 finally. Down a star and out of things to say, Season 6 flounders.\"[33] Jack Seale of The Guardian rated the season 2 stars out of 5 stating, \"We still need to talk about Kevin. It\u2019s impossible not to miss Spacey\u2019s presence as Robin Wright struggles to make her mark and save Netflix\u2019s first big show.\"[34]\n\nThe series finale in particular was met with largely negative reviews. Scott Von Doviak of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \"C-\", praising Wright's direction but criticizing the writing and the characterization of Claire during the final season.[35] Kyle Fowle of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a \"D\" rating, saying the ultimate flaw of the season and the finale was the large focus on Frank and Frank's legacy.[36] Todd VanDerWerff of Vox gave the finale a one-and-a-half star rating out of five, saying the season \"saved the worst for last\".[37]"}

He has since appeared in over 70 films and is widely regarded as an \"action hero\"[2][3][4] due to his portrayal of John McClane in the Die Hard franchise (1988\u20132013), and other such roles.\n\nHis credits also include Death Becomes Her (1992), Pulp Fiction (1994), 12 Monkeys (1995), The Fifth Element (1997), Armageddon (1998), The Sixth Sense (1999), Unbreakable (2000), Sin City (2005), Red (2010), Moonrise Kingdom, The Expendables 2, and Looper (all 2012).

He has since released two more solo albums, in 1989 and 2001.\n\nWillis is the recipient of several accolades, including a Golden Globe, two Primetime Emmy Awards, and two People's Choice Awards. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2006.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nWalter Bruce Willis[5] was born on March 19, 1955, in the town of Idar-Oberstein, West Germany.[6][7][8] His father, David Willis, was an American soldier. His mother, Marlene,[9] was German, born in Kassel.[6][7] Willis is the oldest of four children with a sister named Florence and two brothers, Robert (deceased) and David.[10]\n\nAfter being discharged from the military in 1957, Willis's father took his family back to Carneys Point Township, New Jersey.[11] Willis has described himself as having come from a \"long line of blue collar people\".[11] His mother worked in a bank and his father was a welder, master mechanic, and factory worker.[5] Willis attended Penns Grove High School in his hometown, where he encountered issues with a stutter.[11] He was nicknamed \"Buck-Buck\" by his schoolmates.[5][12][13] Willis joined the drama club in high school, and acting on stage reduced his stutter. He was eventually appointed student council president.[5]\n\nAfter he graduated from high school in 1973, Willis took a job as a security guard at the Salem Nuclear Power Plant[14][15] and transported work crews at the DuPont Chambers Works factory in Deepwater, New Jersey.[15] After working as a private investigator (a role he would play in the television series Moonlighting and the 1991 film The Last Boy Scout), Willis turned to acting. He enrolled in the Drama Program at Montclair State University, where he was cast in the class production of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof. Willis left school in his junior year in 1977 and moved to New York City,[7] where in the early 1980s he supported himself as a bartender at the West 19th Street art bar Kamikaze.[16] He performed as an extra in Paul Newman's closing summation scene in The Verdict in 1982.\n\nCareer\n\n1980s\n\nWillis upon receiving an Emmy Award in 1987 for Best Actor in Moonlighting\n\nWillis left New York City and headed to California to audition for several television shows.[7] In 1984, he appeared in an episode of the TV series Miami Vice, titled \"No Exit\".\n\nIn 1985, he was the guest actor in the first episode of the 1980s revival of The Twilight Zone, \"Shatterday\".[17] He successfully auditioned for the role of David Addison Jr. of the television series Moonlighting (1985\u20131989), competing against 3,000 other actors for the position.[18]\n\nThe starring role, opposite Cybill Shepherd, helped to establish him as a comedic actor, with the show lasting five seasons winning him an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Television Series Musical or Comedy.[11] During the height of the show's success, beverage maker Seagram hired Willis as the pitchman for their Golden Wine Cooler products.[19] The advertising campaign paid the rising star between $5\u20137 million over two years. In spite of that, Willis chose not to renew his contract with the company when he decided to stop drinking alcohol in 1988.[20]\n\nWillis had his first lead role in a feature film in the 1987 Blake Edwards film Blind Date, with Kim Basinger and John Larroquette.[11] Edwards cast him again to play the real-life cowboy actor Tom Mix in Sunset (1988). However, it was his then-unexpected turn in the film Die Hard (1988) as John McClane that catapulted him to movie star and action hero status.[11] He performed most of his own stunts in the film,[21] and the film grossed $138,708,852 worldwide.[22]\n\nFollowing his success with Die Hard, he had a leading role in the drama In Country as Vietnam veteran Emmett Smith and also provided the voice for a talking baby in Look Who's Talking, as well as its sequel, Look Who's Talking Too.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Willis enjoyed moderate success as a recording artist, recording an album of pop-blues titled The Return of Bruno, which included the hit single \"Respect Yourself\" featuring The Pointer Sisters.[23] The LP was promoted by a Spinal Tap\u2013like rockumentary parody featuring scenes of Willis performing at famous events including Woodstock. He released a version of the Drifters song \"Under the Boardwalk\" as a second single; it got to No. 2 in the UK Top 40 but was less successful in the U.S. Willis returned to the recording studio several times afterward.[citation needed]\n\n1990s\n\nHaving acquired major personal success and pop culture influence playing John McClane in Die Hard, Willis reprised his role in the sequels Die Hard 2 (1990) and Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995).[11] These first three installments in the Die Hard series grossed over US$700 million internationally and propelled Willis to the first rank of Hollywood action stars.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Willis's career suffered a moderate slump, as he starred in flops such as The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990). He gained more success with Striking Distance (1993) but flopped again with Color of Night (1994): another box office failure, it was savaged by critics but did well in the home video market and became one of the Top 20 most-rented films in the United States in 1995.[24]\n\nIn 1994, he had a supporting role as Butch Coolidge in Quentin Tarantino's acclaimed Pulp Fiction,[11] which gave a new boost to his career. In 1996, he was the executive producer and star of the cartoon Bruno the Kid which featured a CGI representation of himself.[25] That same year, he starred in Mike Judge's animated film Beavis and Butt-head Do America with his then-wife Demi Moore. In the movie, he plays a drunken criminal named \"Muddy Grimes\", who mistakenly sends Judge's titular characters to kill his wife, Dallas (voiced by Moore). He then played the lead roles in 12 Monkeys (1995) and The Fifth Element (1997). However, by the end of the 1990s his career had fallen into another slump with critically panned films like The Jackal, Mercury Rising, and Breakfast of Champions, saved only by the success of the Michael Bay-directed Armageddon which was the highest-grossing film of 1998 worldwide.[26] The same year his voice and likeness were featured in the PlayStation video game Apocalypse.[27] In 1999, Willis then played the starring role in M. Night Shyamalan's film, The Sixth Sense, which was both a commercial and critical success.[11]\n\n2000s\n\nWillis after a ceremony where he was named Hasty Pudding Theatrical's Man of the Year in 2002\n\nIn 2000, Willis won an Emmy[28] for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his work on Friends (in which he played the father of Ross Geller's much-younger girlfriend).[29] He was also nominated for a 2001 American Comedy Award (in the Funniest Male Guest Appearance in a TV Series category) for his work on Friends. Also in 2000, Willis played Jimmy \"The Tulip\" Tudeski in The Whole Nine Yards alongside Matthew Perry.

In 2005, he appeared in the film adaptation of Sin City. In 2007, he appeared in the Planet Terror half of the double feature Grindhouse as the villain, a mutant soldier. This marked Willis's second collaboration with director Robert Rodriguez, following Sin City.\n\nWillis has appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman several times throughout his career. He filled in for an ill David Letterman on his show February 26, 2003, when he was supposed to be a guest.[31] On many of his appearances on the show, Willis stages elaborate jokes, such as wearing a day-glo orange suit in honor of the Central Park gates, having one side of his face made up with simulated buckshot wounds after the Harry Whittington shooting, or trying to break a record (parody of David Blaine) of staying underwater for only twenty seconds.\n\nOn April 12, 2007, he appeared again, this time wearing a Sanjaya Malakar wig.[32] On his June 25, 2007, appearance, he wore a mini-turban on his head to accompany a joke about his own fictional documentary titled An Unappealing Hunch (a wordplay on An Inconvenient Truth).[33] Willis also appeared in Japanese Subaru Legacy television commercials.[34] Tying in with this, Subaru did a limited run of Legacys, badged \"Subaru Legacy Touring Bruce\", in honor of Willis.\n\nWillis has appeared in four films with Samuel L. Jackson (National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1, Pulp Fiction, Die Hard with a Vengeance, and Unbreakable) and both actors were slated to work together in Black Water Transit, before dropping out. Willis also worked with his eldest daughter, Rumer, in the 2005 film Hostage. In 2007, he appeared in the thriller Perfect Stranger, opposite Halle Berry, the crime/drama film Alpha Dog, opposite Sharon Stone, and reprised his role as John McClane in Live Free or Die Hard. Subsequently, he appeared in the films What Just Happened and Surrogates, based on the comic book of the same name.[35]\n\nWillis was slated to play U.S. Army general William R. Peers in director Oliver Stone's Pinkville, a drama about the investigation of the 1968 My Lai massacre.[36] However, due to the 2007 Writers Guild of America strike, the film was cancelled. Willis appeared on the 2008 Blues Traveler album North Hollywood Shootout, giving a spoken word performance over an instrumental blues rock jam on the track \"Free Willis (Ruminations from Behind Uncle Bob's Machine Shop)\". In early 2009, he appeared in an advertising campaign to publicize the insurance company Norwich Union's change of name to Aviva.[37]\n\n2010s\n\nWillis starred with Tracy Morgan in the comedy Cop Out, directed by Kevin Smith and about two police detectives investigating the theft of a baseball card.[38] The film was released in February 2010. Willis appeared in the music video for the song \"Stylo\" by Gorillaz.[39] Also in 2010, he appeared in a cameo with former Planet Hollywood co-owners and '80s action stars Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger in the film The Expendables. Willis played the role of generic bald man \"Mr. Church\". This was the first time these three notable action movie actors appeared on screen together. Although the scene featuring the three was short, it was one of the most highly anticipated scenes in the film. The trio filmed their scene in an empty church on October 24, 2009.[40] Willis next starred in RED, an adaptation of the comic book mini-series of the same name, in which he portrayed Frank Moses. The film was released on October 15, 2010.[41]\n\nWillis starred alongside Bill Murray, Edward Norton, and Frances McDormand in Moonrise Kingdom (2012). Filming took place in Rhode Island under the direction of Wes Anderson, in 2011.[42] Willis returned, in an expanded role, in The Expendables 2 (2012).[43] He appeared alongside Joseph Gordon-Levitt in the sci-fi action film, Looper (2012), as the older version of Gordon-Levitt's character, Joe.\n\nWillis teamed up with 50 Cent in a film directed by David Barrett called Fire with Fire, starring opposite Josh Duhamel and Rosario Dawson, about a fireman who must save the love of his life.[44] Willis also joined Vince Vaughn and Catherine Zeta-Jones in Lay the Favorite, directed by Stephen Frears, about a Las Vegas cocktail waitress who becomes an elite professional gambler.[45] The two films were distributed by Lionsgate Entertainment.\n\nWillis reprised his most famous role, John McClane, for a fifth time, starring in A Good Day to Die Hard, which was released on February 14, 2013.[46] In an interview, Willis said, \"I have a warm spot in my heart for Die Hard..... it's just the sheer novelty of being able to play the same character over 25 years and still be asked back is fun. It's much more challenging to have to do a film again and try to compete with myself, which is what I do in Die Hard. I try to improve my work every time.\"[47]\n\nOn October 12, 2013, Willis hosted Saturday Night Live with Katy Perry as a musical guest.[48]\n\nWillis will star in the movie adaptation of the video game Kane & Lynch: Dead Men, named Kane & Lynch.[49]\n\nIn 2015, Willis made his Broadway debut in William Goldman's adaptation of Stephen King's novel Misery opposite Laurie Metcalf at the Broadhurst Theatre.[50]\n\nIn 2018, it was announced that Willis would be the next to be roasted by Comedy Central.[51]\n\nFilms featuring Willis have grossed between US$2.64 billion and $3.05 billion at the North American box offices, making him in 2010 the eighth highest-grossing actor in a leading role and 12th-highest including supporting roles.[52][53] He is a two-time Emmy Award winner, two-time Golden Globe Award winner, and has been nominated for a Saturn Award four times.\n\nBusiness activities\n\nWillis owns property in Los Angeles and in Penns Grove, New Jersey; rents apartments at Trump Tower[54] and in Riverside South, Manhattan,[55] both in New York City; has a home in Malibu, California; a ranch in Montana; a beach house on Parrot Cay in Turks and Caicos; and multiple properties in Sun Valley, Idaho.[7]\n\nIn 2000, Willis, with his business partner Arnold Rifkin, started a motion picture production company called Cheyenne Enterprises. He left the company to be run solely by Rifkin in 2007 after Live Free or Die Hard.[56] He also owns several small businesses in Hailey, Idaho, including The Mint Bar and The Liberty Theater and is a co-founder of Planet Hollywood, with actors Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone.[57]\n\nIn 2009, Willis signed a contract to become the international face of Belvedere SA's Sobieski Vodka in exchange for 3.3% ownership in the company.[58]\n\nPersonal life\n\nOver the Hedge on June 28, 2006 Willis at the German premiere ofon June 28, 2006\n\nWillis's acting role models are Gary Cooper, Robert De Niro, Steve McQueen and John Wayne.[59] Willis is left handed.[60]\n\nRelationships and children\n\nAt the premiere for the film Stakeout, Willis met actress Demi Moore. They married on November 21, 1987, and had three daughters: Rumer (born August 16, 1988),[61] Scout (born July 20, 1991),[62] and Tallulah (born February 3, 1994).[63] Willis and Moore announced their separation on June 24, 1998.[64] They filed for divorce on October 18, 2000[65] and on that same day, the divorce was finalized.[66][67] Regarding the divorce, Willis stated, \"I felt I had failed as a father and a husband by not being able to make it work.\" He credited actor Will Smith for helping him cope with the situation.[7][19] Willis has maintained a close relationship with both Moore and her third husband, actor Ashton Kutcher, and attended their wedding.[68]\n\nWillis was engaged to actress Brooke Burns until they broke up in 2004 after ten months together.[18] He dated actress Tamara Feldman for a time, after they met during the filming of Perfect Stranger.[69][70] He married model Emma Heming in Turks and Caicos on March 21, 2009;[71] guests included his three daughters, Demi Moore, and Ashton Kutcher. The ceremony was not legally binding, so the couple wed again in a civil ceremony in Beverly Hills, six days later.[72] The couple has two daughters: Mabel Ray Willis (b. 2012)[73] and Evelyn Penn Willis (b. 2014).[74]\n\nReligious views\n\nWillis was a Lutheran at some point,[75] but no longer practices. In a July 1998 interview with George magazine, he stated:\n\nOrganized religions in general, in my opinion, are dying forms. They were all very important when we didn't know why the sun moved, why weather changed, why hurricanes occurred, or volcanoes happened. Modern religion is the end trail of modern mythology. But there are people who interpret the Bible literally. Literally! I choose not to believe that's the way. And that's what makes America cool, you know?[76]\n\nPolitical views\n\nIn 1988, Willis and then-wife Demi Moore campaigned for Democratic Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis's Presidential bid. Four years later, he supported President George H. W. Bush for reelection and was an outspoken critic of Bill Clinton. However, in 1996, he declined to endorse Clinton's Republican opponent Bob Dole, because Dole had criticized Demi Moore for her role in the film Striptease.[77] Willis was an invited speaker at the 2000 Republican National Convention,[78] and supported George W. Bush that year. He did not make any contributions or public endorsements in the 2008 presidential campaign. In several June 2007 interviews, he declared that he maintains some Republican ideologies.[7][19]\n\nIn 2006, he said that the United States should intervene more into Colombia, in order to end the drug trafficking.[79] In several interviews Willis has said that he supports large salaries for teachers and police officers, and said he is disappointed in the United States foster care system as well as treatment of Native Americans.[77][80] Willis also stated that he is a supporter of gun rights, stating, \"Everyone has a right to bear arms. If you take guns away from legal gun owners, then the only people who have guns are the bad guys.\"[81]\n\nIn February 2006, Willis appeared in Manhattan to talk about his film 16 Blocks with reporters. One reporter attempted to ask Willis about his opinion on the current government, but was interrupted by Willis in mid-sentence: \"I'm sick of answering this fucking question. I'm a Republican only as far as I want a smaller government, I want less government intrusion. I want them to stop shitting on my money and your money and tax dollars that we give 50 percent of every year. I want them to be fiscally responsible and I want these goddamn lobbyists out of Washington. Do that and I'll say I'm a Republican. I hate the government, OK? I'm apolitical. Write that down. I'm not a Republican.\"[82]\n\nWillis's name was in an advertisement in the Los Angeles Times on August 17, 2006, that condemned Hamas and Hezbollah and supported Israel in the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war.[83]\n\nMilitary interests\n\nThroughout his film career, Willis has depicted several military characters in films such as In Country, The Siege, Hart's War, Tears of the Sun, Grindhouse, and G.I. Joe: Retaliation. Growing up in a military family, Willis has publicly sold Girl Scout cookies for the United States armed forces. In 2002, Willis' then 8-year-old daughter, Tallulah, suggested that he purchase Girl Scout cookies to send to troops. Willis purchased 12,000 boxes of cookies, and they were distributed to sailors aboard USS John F. Kennedy and other troops stationed throughout the Middle East at the time.[84]\n\nIn 2003, Willis visited Iraq as part of the USO tour, singing to the troops with his band, The Accelerators.[85] Willis considered joining the military to help fight the second Iraq War, but was deterred by his age.[86] It was believed he offered $1 million to any noncombatant who turns in terrorist leaders Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi; in the June 2007 issue of Vanity Fair, however, he clarified that the statement was made hypothetically and not meant to be taken literally. Willis has also criticized the media for its coverage of the war, complaining that the press were more likely to focus on the negative aspects of the war:\n\nI went to Iraq because what I saw when I was over there was soldiers\u2014young kids for the most part\u2014helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back on, helping get hospitals open, helping get the water turned back on and you don't hear any of that on the news. You hear, 'X number of people were killed today,' which I think does a huge disservice. It's like spitting on these young men and women who are over there fighting to help this country.[87]\n\nWillis stated in 2005 that he wanted to \"make a pro-war film in which American soldiers will be depicted as brave fighters for freedom and democracy.\"[88] The film would follow members of Deuce Four, the 1st Battalion, 24th Infantry, who spent considerable time in Mosul and were decorated heavily for it. The film is to be based on the writings of blogger Michael Yon, a former United States Army Special Forces soldier who was embedded with Deuce Four and sent regular dispatches about their activities. Willis described the plot of the film as \"these guys who do what they are asked for very little money to defend and fight for what they consider to be freedom.\"[89]\n\nIn popular culture\n\nIn 1996, Roger Director, a writer and producer from Moonlighting, wrote a roman \u00e0 clef on Willis titled A Place to Fall.[90] Cybill Shepherd wrote in her 2000 autobiography, Cybill Disobedience, that Willis became angry at Director when he read the book and discovered the character had been written as a \"neurotic, petulant actor.\"\n\nIn 1998, Willis participated in Apocalypse, a PlayStation video game. The game was originally announced to feature Willis as a sidekick, not as the main character. The company reworked the game using Willis's likeness and voice and changed the game to use him as the main character.[27]\n\nFilmography\n\nSelected notable roles:\n\nDiscography\n\nSolo albums\n\nCompilations/guest appearances\n\nAwards and honors\n\nHollywood Walk of Fame star\n\nWillis has won a variety of awards and has received various honors throughout his career in television and film."}

Yet, Chastain says that might be how her Italian in-laws, the parents of her fashion executive husband fashion executive Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo, feel about her. Last night when she stopped by Jimmy Kimmel Live, she opened up about an awkward season of holiday meals with her husband's family as well as her own \u2014 mostly due to her vegan diet and cultural differences.\n\nThe two families met in the Alps, Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, where things got \"interesting.\" \"My family is from Northern California,\" Chastain told Kimmel. \"And his family is from Veneto, Italy. My family doesn't speak [Italian] and his family speaks very little English... It was a very quiet holiday, but there was a lot of pointing and a lot of food.\"\n\nThat's where the families differed: \"We've known each other for about six years and Americans eat in about an hour,\" says Chastain. \"A meal starts and then it's done. When I went to Italy, I didn't realize that meals last for three or four hours... I don't understand this but Sunday brunch will go from 1 pm to 5 pm. You eat one course and it's delicious. Then the second your plate is done, his mom is putting more food on my plate. So I have a trick where I just push the food around on my plate for hours.\"\n\nChastain's vegan diet, however, poses more of an issue for her in these situations than the duration of the meals. \"In the beginning, I would say I'm vegan. Which is like the worst thing. I don't eat 10 meals and I'm vegan. I would say, 'I'm sorry I can't eat that,' and [my mother-in-law] would say, 'No problem, we have fish'.\"\n\n\"Do you think they hate you?\" Kimmel asks, to which Chastain responds, \"Maybe that's why it's so quiet. They just hate me.\"\n\nChastain explained why she went vegan last year, telling W , \" I found myself going to veganism because a friend of mine had a two week vegan food delivery program she wasn\u2019t going to use so I used it, and immediately I just had more energy than I\u2019ve ever had in my life... Being vegan was not anything I ever wanted to be. I just really was listening to what my body was telling me.\"\n\nRelated: Jessica Chastain Says 'Major Change' Is Coming to Hollywood in Palm Springs International Film Festival Speech"}

(Photo: Dan MacMedan, USA TODAY NETWORK)\n\nBackstage at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, Shameless best-actor winner William H. Macy was asked if he had any advice for younger men on how to act around women in Hollywood.\n\nHis response, made earnestly, was ponderous, weighing the creative risks of creating a politically correct environment in the arts, gender parity (\"it's inevitable\" he said firmly) and how men feel like \"we're under attack\" in the #MeToo era.\n\nIt was a puzzling mix.\n\nOn what he would tell younger men in his industry: \"That's a really complicated question because on one hand, with what we do for the living, we've got to be free to speak the unspeakable and try things. So I hope it doesn't throw a wet blanket on things. And I don't believe it will because half the business is women and they're smart,\" said Macy.\n\nSAG Awards 2018: Time's Up quotes overheard on the red carpet\n\nCLOSE Many of Hollywood's most powerful men are struggling with how to address the sexual harassment and assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein and others in the industry. Here's why. USA TODAY\n\nThe actor noted he has two daughters (with wife Felicity Huffman). \"And I'm thrilled for them. It's a good time to be a girl. I'm proud of this business, because such things as safety in the workplace \u2014 that's done, we're not going back. It changed in an instant and it's not going back. When it comes to equality in pay, it's inevitable, and it's going to happen quickly.\"\n\nMacy then focused on how men are grappling with the #MeToo era.\n\n\"It's hard to be a man these days,\" said Macy. \"I think a lot of us feel like we're under attack and feel like we need to apologize. Perhaps we do. Perhaps we are. But we'll keep talking.\"\n\nMacy added that he had recently convened with other men to discuss aspects of Time's Up, the anti-harassment initiative started earlier this month by some of Hollywood's leading women.\n\n\"We had a meeting, a bunch of guys got together under the auspices of Time's Up. And that's good for men. Men don't talk enough, and they don't talk to other men. And we talked.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2DAUj7K"}

However, he did get to meet and hold a hedgehog, so it was still pretty successful in our eyes... until it pooped on him.\n\n#TheHuntForDeadpool continued on Tuesday at Disneyland Tokyo. \"I thought Deadpool was a Marvel Superhero?! #whereistheDeadpoolride,\" Tremblay captioned a pic of himself peering into the distance.\n\nRegardless, it appears he still had some fun at the theme park. \"Yesterday I had poo on my hand... now I have Pooh on head,\" he joked.\n\nEarlier this week, Reynolds' wife, Blake Lively, was having some Deadpool 2 fun of her own, stepping out to the film's premiere in New York City in an ensemble inspired by her husband's character.\n\nSee the rockin' look (and hear what Reynolds had to say about it while chatting with ET!) in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nJacob Tremblay Reveals How He Would Prepare for a 'Really Serious Scene' Filming 'Wonder' (Exclusive)\n\nJacob Tremblay Celebrates 11th Birthday With Hilarious 'Stranger Things'-Inspired Photo\n\n'Star Wars' Superfan Jacob Tremblay Finally Met Mark Hamill, Says He 'Geeked Out Big Time'\n\nRelated Gallery"}

Regardless of the nature of their visit, every single person \u2014 young or old, male or female \u2014 finds a way to weave the question into the discussion. Of course they never fail to mention it\u2019s (cough, cough) for their mom/wife/daughter/aunt/(insert any relationship) and I of course smile. Then again, I can\u2019t say I blame them, I\u2019ve lived in Southern California for nearly 20 years, and it\u2019s still really fun to find celebrities when you least expect it.\n\nNaturally, celebrity spotting is one of the biggest perks while traveling to the entertainment capital of the world.

{"label": true, "txt": "\n\nColton, America\u2019s new Bachelor, receives a rose from Becca on last season of \u201cThe Bachelorette.\u201d (Paul Hebert/ABC)\n\nABC officially has a new star of \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d And quite a few viewers aren\u2019t pleased.\n\nThe network announced Tuesday morning that Colton Underwood \u2014 the 26-year-old former football player and third runner-up on last season of \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d \u2014 will become the next Bachelor, one of the most highly coveted positions on reality television. This comes on the heels of his exit from spinoff \u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d on Monday night, when he ended his fling with contestant Tia Booth.\n\n\u201cIt was his good looks, love for dogs and vulnerability that charmed not only Bachelorette Becca Kufrin, but all of Bachelor Nation,\u201d ABC said in a news release. \u201cAfter a summer of growth and a new perspective on what he is looking for, Colton is more than ready for this next chapter.\u201d\n\nAlso, as Colton has discussed on the show multiple times, he is a virgin. For ABC, this is a big win. In 2013, Sean Lowe was nicknamed the \u201cVirgin Bachelor\u201d after the tabloids reported he was a \u201cborn again virgin,\u201d although the show itself avoided the topic. So can you imagine how excited the producers are for a \u201cBachelor\u201d star who will actually talk about it? (\u201cThat\u2019s one thing that I took pride in on both seasons, is just being true to where I am,\u201d Colton told Michael Strahan on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d Tuesday.) The potential story lines are endless.\n\n[\u2018The Bachelorette\u2019 addressed Garrett\u2019s Instagram controversy \u2014 but left out a crucial detail]\n\nABC executive Robert Mills made the Sean comparison in a recent E! interview, saying that Colton \u201ccertainly has a lot of the attributes that you love in a Bachelor. There\u2019s a little bit of that Sean Lowe . . . he\u2019s also a guy who is surprisingly funny and charismatic. Colton could be a very interesting Bachelor.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, plenty of viewers feel otherwise. Last week, blogger Reality Steve leaked the news early. \u201cI\u2019m hearing that they will be announcing the next \u2018Bachelor\u2019 soon and it will be Colton,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cMy thoughts are Sean Lowe has been their only successful Bachelor. They must feel Colton is the closest thing they\u2019ll get to Sean. Character, morals, no shady past, etc. Sean 2.0. Here we go. Let the freaking out begin.\u201d\n\nSure enough, the responses poured in, and they were almost uniformly negative. The most common reaction was that while Colton may be a nice guy, he\u2019s extremely boring \u2014 a deadly ingredient in any reality show. Many clamored for a more charming, interesting and mature choice, such as his fellow runners-up Blake Horstmann, Jason Tartick or Wills Reid. Or even fan favorite Joe Amabile, known as Grocery Store Joe.\n\nOthers scoffed about how Colton bounced from \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d (where he appeared heartbroken when Becca broke up with him) to \u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d (where he had an emotional on-and-off relationship with Tia) to \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d with remarkable speed. Raven Gates, Tia\u2019s best friend and former \u201cBachelor\u201d contestant, appeared on \u201cParadise\u201d to warn her pal that Colton may not be there for the right reasons \u2014 and that perhaps he was only interested in dating \u201cIt Girls.\u201d (Before \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d franchise, Colton dated Olympic gymnast Aly Raisman.)\n\n\n\nColton and Tia on \u201cBachelor in Paradise.\u201d (Paul Hebert/ABC)\n\nSome felt that his casting cheapens the already questionable premise of the show. \u201cEven if we\u2019re being generous and calling Colton\u2019s brief time with Becca and Tia \u2018relationships,\u2019 we\u2019re still dealing with an anxious, 26-year-old virgin whose dating history does not indicate he\u2019s ready to put a ring on it,\u201d wrote Entertainment Weekly TV critic Kristen Baldwin, a longtime \u201cBachelor\u201d recapper. \u201cWhat about that says \u2018perfect Bachelor material\u2019 to anyone?\u201d\n\nAmid the outrage, creator Mike Fleiss issued a vague tweet over the weekend: \u201cYou all know what the Bible says about passing judgment on others\u2026 It\u2019s against it. #TheBachelor.\u201d\n\n\u201c1) the Bible has nothing to do with The Bachelor. 2) simply not wanting bachelor Colton isn\u2019t a sin,\u201d one fan tweeted in reply. \u201c3) maybe you should actually listen to who the fans want for once, we\u2019re the reason the show\u2019s still running & without us you\u2019re done.\u201d\n\nOf course, the producers care about only one thing: drama. Colton has already had plenty of it. During \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d this summer, he told Becca that he and Tia had briefly dated a few months earlier. (He contacted her after seeing her on \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d) This was awkward for Becca, given that Tia was one of her closest friends when they competed on Arie Luyendyk Jr.\u2019s season of \u201cThe Bachelor.\u201d Later, Tia made a guest appearance to confess to Becca that she still had feelings for Colton.\n\nThat, combined with Colton\u2019s virgin revelation (although Becca was more concerned with the fact that he had only been in one serious relationship), basically sealed his fate. Even though Colton told Becca he was falling in love with her, she sent him home after he made the final four. A couple of weeks later, Colton had a heated confrontation on the \u201cMen Tell All\u201d episode when another contestant mocked his virginity.\n\nThen, on \u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d last month, Colton and Tia both joined as cast members and hooked up again; their coupling was a big story line. Alas, on Monday, Colton took Tia aside and confessed that he really wanted things to work, but his feelings just weren\u2019t there.\n\n\u201cYou deserve somebody who\u2019s going to be crazy about you every single day,\u201d Colton said.\n\n\u201cBut can you honestly say that you, like, tried?\u201d Tia asked tearfully.\n\n\u201cI could look at you with 100 percent certainty and say that I tried here. I gave it my all,\u201d Colton responded gravely. Tia broke down in sobs.\n\nImmediately, viewers started speculating about the authenticity of Colton and Tia\u2019s breakup, as it was conveniently timed to be just before the \u201cBachelor\u201d announcement the next morning.\n\nThey came to Colton and said: Your puppy-loving charity-running, Twitter-posting self has met the minimum qualifications to be the Bachelor. Dramatically break things off with Tia, but cry REALLY hard so we can use it as the intro to the next season. #BachelorInParadise pic.twitter.com/HAWwd8PTzh \u2014 Emily Ann\u2698 (@IamEmily_Ann) September 4, 2018\n\n\u201cI know Colton is a great guy.\" The #BachelorInParadise editors are even making brokenhearted Tia endorse Colton for Bachelor. \u2014 Emma Gray (@emmaladyrose) September 4, 2018\n\nColton last week when he didn't know if he booked the bachelor gig: I'm ready to date tia.\n\nColton this week when he found out he booked the bachelor gig: nvm #BachelorInParadise \u2014 Bachelor Fanatic (@bachfanatic93) September 4, 2018\n\nThe Tia/Colton storyline \u2014 the early Bachelorette group date awkwardness, Tia's post-hometowns revelation, the silly #BachelorInParadise back-and-forth, tonight's breakup and apparently beyond \u2014 may go down as the most embarrassing, contrived, and misguided in the show's history. \u2014 Rosecast Pod (@RosecastES) September 4, 2018\n\nHowever, with his new \u201cBachelor\u201d gig official, Colton insisted that his former \u201cBachelor\u201d relationships are in the past.\n\n\u201cObviously you can tell how it was all so emotional for me,\u201d Colton told People magazine. \u201cBut it was also good for me.

{"label": true, "txt": "A bill passed by the Michigan State Senate would endanger the health of Michiganders by granting sweeping new powers to practitioners of unscientific bogus medicine and treatments, said the Center for Inquiry.\n\nAnatomy of a Reading\n\nMay 3, 2017\n\nIt\u2019s been just over a year since E! Network brought psychic Tyler Henry to our attention, touting him as the real deal on the reality show \u201cHollywood Medium.\u201d I\u2019ve written about him a few times, here, here, here, here and here. Now it has been announced that Tyler Henry has been given a third season, to be broadcast in May 2017. E! has also announced that Henry has a new batch of celebrities to read, including ex-CNN \u201cvictims\u2019 rights\u201d lawyer Nancy Grace, who frankly should know better than to support a grief vampire like Henry. That will be another article for another day; it is never ending.\n\nTyler Henry mostly reads celebrities. Usually ones who are hosted on the E! Network. The main dialog throughout the \u201cHollywood Medium\u201d series is that Henry does not know who these celebrities are when he reads for them. That could possibly have been true at the beginning of 2016 when he was first starting out, but the claim is getting a bit old now that he is often in the entertainment news along with these same celebs he\u2019s reading for. Of course he knows who they are! It\u2019s not like he\u2019s living in an isolated room with no Internet or TV access. I don\u2019t know how much longer they are going to be able to keep saying he knows no celebrities. Maybe they have a new angle this season?\n\nPast shows portray Henry as a na\u00efve young man who is genuine and adorable, and never knows anyone he reads. In fact, they go to a lot of trouble to include footage of him talking about how he did not know each person beforehand. I think Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cThe lady doth protest too much, methinks\u201d applies here. If Henry is aware of the person beforehand, then what he is doing is called a hot-read, and is a popular method psychics use to get information from \u201cthe other side,\u201d when really the information came from a Google search.\n\nI\u2019ve seen a lot of criticism of Tyler Henry, and I might be alone in thinking that what is going on with his readings has nothing to do with Google and everything to do with cold-reading. Of course, this is just my opinion after having been involved in investigating psychics for years and watching a lot of Henry\u2019s readings, but I think that I have some good evidence to support my claim.\n\nE! Network uploaded a YouTube video of Henry giving a fan a reading that has been viewed 266,418 times. There are 1,519 likes and 101 dislikes, along with 763 comments. Some of the comments are from the sitter, Jamie Horn, who says about her reading \u201cIt was amazing and emotional!\u201d Yes, I bet it was. Horn won the reading from a Facebook contest. It was an all-expense paid trip, and even more importantly her father came through in the reading and said he was not worried about her at all. That must have been exhilarating.\n\nHorn insists in the YouTube comments that only the promotion company knew who she was. How this promotion company works with the person they are promoting is unknown, however it makes sense that they want to get the best possible video out of it for \u2026 promotion, obviously.\n\nHot-reading through Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and any social media site is always a possibility. Mediums have been finding out information that \u201cno one could have known\u201d ever since people have been claiming that they are in communication with the dead. How hard is it to look at someone\u2019s Facebook page to glean a bit of \u201cassurance,\u201d just in case the spirits are a bit groggy?\n\nIn this specific reading with Jamie Horn, I don\u2019t think there is any hot-reading going on. Instead what I think is that, with a close look at the actual reading, we can see that there are almost no specific hits, some very general statements and lots of leading the sitter to giving up the information themselves. Information that Henry just regurgitates back to the sitter as if he knew it all along. Statements like \u201cWho was David?\u201d \u201cDavid was my brother\u201d Henry smiles and nods, \u201cYes, that is what he is saying, he is your brother.\u201d\n\nAs Horn said in her comments, \u201cIt was amazing and emotional!\u201d; it truly is. She does not have the ability at that moment to pause, back up, and really think about what he is saying. She isn\u2019t even able to ask questions or take notes. We have that ability. I can sit here at my desk and watch and rewatch sections of the video repeatedly. I can look at her expressions and body language and take notes all the way through. I can sit here smugly with the luxury of knowing how this is done and ridicule Horn for being so gullible. Really, though, that smugness does not sit well with me. It is disquieting to watch another human being led through an emotional roller-coaster ride, having her memories of her family rewritten by this grief vampire. It is ugly to watch as he brings her to tears over and over again. She is not stupid; she is just uninformed. Possibly she was raised thinking this is normal. If mediums could really communicate with the dead, why do we have so many missing persons and unsolved crimes?\n\nI don\u2019t know if you are familiar with the Columbo TV movie series. One of my favorite episodes was loosely based on the relationship between Uri Geller and James Randi, called \u201cColumbo Goes to the Guillotine.\u201d It was released in 1989 and deals with a remote viewer (the Geller character) trying to get himself hired by the U.S. Government. The stunt that was pulled off by the remote viewer was amazing, and Columbo had no idea how it was done. He then meets a young magician and after explaining it to the kid, asks how he thought it was done. The kid says that he did not know how, but the way to figure it out was to always remember \u201cit is a trick. Once you start with that premise, you can eventually work it out.\u201d\n\nSo here I am, about to break down this reading in detail. Well actually not in detail here, only a few hardcore readers will want to read the minutia of detail that goes on behind the scenes. For those few people, I have a link to my notes located HERE. For everyone else, let\u2019s break down the reading broadly so you can see what I see. The simplest solution is that this is a trick, so keep that in mind and the solution will become obvious.\n\nThe reading given to Horn can be summed up, for the sake of brevity, into three sections: First Impressions, The Reading, and Platitudes.\n\nFirst Impressions: He knows nothing but what he can see, smell, and observe of her body language. Her age, ethnicity, accent, jewelry, style, and so much more go into how to approach this woman. Henry has been doing this for only a year or so; he is picking up the skill as he goes. As he does more of these readings, he will get better.\n\nThe first thing Henry does is set up the parameters for the reading. He tells her that 80 percent of the time she will hopefully understand the reading, and 20 percent will be something she will have to think about or ask family about later. I guess he is feeling pretty confident that he will be accurate 100 percent of the time. I love it when numbers are used; it gives us something to use for evaluation.\n\nHenry starts by offering two talkative women and an older man. He is watching Horn\u2019s body language, and she clearly wants to hear from the older man. Henry steers in that direction.\n\nThe older man has a sense of humor, is a sweet guy, does not tell long funny stories but little funny ones, likes to have fun, focuses on the moment, and does not want the family to focus on his health issues. And that is all. No mention of how this older man knows Horn, no names, no cause of death or anything specific about a year of birth/death or mentions Horn\u2019s mother, siblings or, well \u2026 much of anything.\n\nBut Horn jumps on it, giving positive feedback, and is all smiles. Henry then, apparently stumped about what to do next, asks her for details about this person and their death.\n\nThis man, who Henry has now learned is Horn\u2019s father, wants to acknowledge a Bob, Bobby or Robert. Horn explains that her husband\u2019s name is Robert. Sounds like a hit, right? I\u2019m sure Horn will spin it unknowingly that way. She probably thinks her father reached out to her husband Robert. But Henry did not say the older man was her father, he learned that when Horn said so. And Henry did not say that Robert was her husband; he was throwing out names and she claimed it. How common is a name like Robert? According to Social Security databases, Robert has been in the top five most popular male names in America for decades. Adding Bob and Bobby as well as saying \u201cwho is \u2026 ,\u201c and not stating if this is a living person or someone on the other side, or a pet or what have you, really ups the odds that Horn is going to supply a hit for the name.\n\nNext is a series of complete misses. Horn did not react to any of these statements other than with a \u201cmaybe\u201d statement. Henry did not feel like she gives him a strong response so he moves on after each of these.\n\nHe is seeing a mining shaft \u2026 someone lives in a mining town \u2026 old wood not in use any more \u2026 somebody lived near an abandoned mining shaft \u2026 or an abandoned well \u2026 something in the dirt or the ground.\n\nHorses, \u201che\u2019s having me bring up the horses \u2026 a female \u2026 was bucked off a horse or kicked off a horse \u2026 a childhood incident \u2026 I\u2019m seeing Idaho \u2026 or going more in that direction.\u201d Horn had already told Henry she was raised in Idaho, so this isn\u2019t a hit.\n\n\u201cDo you know anyone with any Lynn connections?\u201d\n\nA child on the other side that did not live a full life. \u201cDoesn\u2019t look like the kind of situation where the child is kind of really born in the traditional sense and this is a loss that would have been traumatic to a woman \u2026 If someone suffered a miscarriage, a stillborn, or had a child that was birthed and died shortly after ... SIDS.\u201d\n\nHorn reacts positively to the SIDS reference. Sounds like Henry got it right, what a hit! Wrong, what is left to throw out there? I suppose if Horn had not reacted to the SIDS comment, then Henry could have kept going by suggesting a child that died after its first birthday, or died young after its second birthday, its third birthday, before it was a teenager. I guess at any time Henry could also have moved on to something else if he didn\u2019t feel confident about where he was going with this. Oddly, Henry never mentions if it was a baby boy or girl, and no names. Not of his first wife or the baby, or anyone that would be associated with the child.\n\n\u201cOlder female \u2026 who passed away of \u2026 feminine based cancer \u2026 Pat or Patricia \u2026 keep in mind breast or susceptibility to breast cancer or \u2026 female cancers \u2026 Pat, Patty, Patricia?\u201d\n\n\u201cOlder lady \u2026 she's having to bring up these rings \u2026 someone might have taken a piece of jewelry and then altered it into a different piece of jewelry.\u201d\n\nA woman comes through with mental decline; she is really independent and hated that she lost her mental abilities near the end. She was \u201cexperiencing some personality kind of stuff and a bit of a change \u2026 given a medication that makes them different \u2026 didn't die of Alzheimer's or dementia ... Forgetting.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho had the stroke and then survived?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is Ellen or Helen \u2026 getting a very strong E sounding female name \u2026 unless I have the sides switched \u2026 or Elaine.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe teacher thing\u201d\n\nThe next long exchange was more of the same, with Henry giving general questions and Horn trying very hard to make sense of them and claim them as family members.\n\nHer father is \u201chaving me bring up the younger female in the family ... I don\u2019t know the exact relation he would be to her ... a living family member ... going through a time of transition ... he\u2019s watching over her.\" Then Henry gives a list of things for Horn to try to hit on. Watching her body language, she is struggling to make sense of it. \u201cGoing to college ... a decision to move ... a big shift or a big situation in their personal life ... a time of transition ... concerns over her ... struggling emotionally ... going through a rough patch.\u201d And he \"can\u2019t establish the age range of this person.\" Henry finally asks Horn \"who would be the youngest female within your family or anyone that you could think of as like fitting that bill? ... someone he would view like a daughter or like a granddaughter?\"\n\nHorn answers \"my niece, Nicki ... possibly\" Henry asks how old is Nicki. She replies \"thirty-five, but she has a daughter that\u2019s twenty-one that\u2019s going to college.\" This would be his great-granddaughter. A quick calculation shows that her mother would have been about fourteen when the child was born, so keep that in mind with these next statements from Henry. Great-grandpa was a father figure to this female who is independent and needs help from the family; she is not getting the help she needs; he asks \"is the father involved in this girl's life?\" Horn replies \"not really.\"\n\nNow that Henry is on surer ground with this storyline; he says that great-great-grandpa acknowledged that the girl's father isn't in her life. The girl (still unnamed) is going through an academic as well as a residential shift ... she will go to school with one major and then shift it ... it will happen; it may have already happened ... Great-grandpa is joking about her love life, telling her to not to get to serious with anyone.\n\nSo this younger female is both independent and not independent at the same time. She is in college and experiencing an academic shift. She is going to change her major, or maybe already has. Her father isn't a part of her life. Remember, her mother was about fourteen when the child was born, so maybe not a strong relationship with her father? How vague is all this? Why doesn't Great-grandpa give this child some real advice, maybe tell her what major she should go for? What career is she going to have later on?\n\nWhy doesn't he know her name? Tell her the name of the person she will fall in love with? Steer her away from bad decisions, bad people ... didn't he say he was watching over her? That isn't creepy at all, is it?\n\nThis next exchange took Henry a while to get through. If you are just watching the video once, you might think they are amazing hits. But once you watch the reading more than once and take notes, you will see that nothing but what appears to be cold-reading is happening. When Horn tells Henry information, Henry repeats it back saying \u201cyes, that is what I\u2019m hearing\u201d statements.\n\nOne is a woman who was not ready to die yet. This is something that Henry stays on for a very long time. In her YouTube comments, Horn says that this was really convincing, as he heard from her sister and answered a lot of questions about her death. Pay really close attention to what Henry really says. I think when I break it down you will see that he says almost nothing about the questions of her death, and didn't even know it was her sister until she tells him.\n\n\"A female who \u2026 is dying too soon.\" Horn smiles and said \"yes.\" Henry says she did not die in her 80s or 90s. She is very unhappy because she thinks she died too soon. Henry thinks he is on the right track, and Horn agrees. She was too young to die, and she was not ready to go. Horn keeps agreeing with this. Henry says that this woman was looking forward to the upcoming year and to family. She had a career and things to look forward to. Horn says, \"You\u2019re right on.\"\n\nHenry asks \"Do you know if she was looking forward to anything specifically ... coming up that you can recall?\" Horn replies, \"I'm not sure. I will say things were going really well for her.\" Henry says that he is seeing money signs, like a promotion at work. Horn agrees. She felt secure in her life, and that more security was coming. She did not want to go.\n\n\"She is having me refer to being alone ... she had just talked to someone right before she had passed.\" All through this exchange Henry keeps repeating that she wasn't ready to die yet and that he keeps getting messages that are \"so weird\" and then Henry said that he is going \"to get to the bottom of this.\" Horn keeps smiling and agreeing.\n\nThen Henry starts saying again that she was alone, it was quick, and she was at home. And that she apologizes for the discovery. Horn acknowledges again, but Henry really does not know where to go with this so he changes tactics. He brings in two children, a boy and a girl. We do not know if this is the first time we are hearing about these children, as there are forty minutes missing from this reading and we are nearing the end, so possibly in the missing minutes he discovers that Horn has two children, a boy and girl.\n\nThe woman, who did not want to go yet, wants to acknowledge two kids that are not her kids but \"like her kids.\" Then after Horn says \"yes,\" Henry says these are nieces or nephews. And then there will be a third child. Horn looks really confused at this point; it seems that the two children are Horn's own kids, and as she is in her 50s, it is pretty unlikely that she is going to be having a third child. But she smiles, and Henry moves on.\n\nThe woman now says that she was not awake or aware when she passed. Then a house alarm is going off\u2014\"keep it in mind.\" No idea what that was about, but Horn laughs and agrees to keep it in mind. The woman \"is having me refer to a female J name.\" Horn says, \"that is me.\"\n\nThe woman keeps talking about being alone, being at home, and wanting to stay at home. She was not conscious when she passed and did not know why she passed.\n\nLet\u2019s pause here for a minute before we continue with this woman who did not want to die yet. What do we know? Well it seems to be Horn's sister and she died alone at home, in her sleep. She does not know how she died; some kind of mystery, even Horn does not know what happened. Oddly her sister does not know her own name or Jamie's name\u2014just that it starts with a J, and she also doesn\u2019t know her niece\u2019s or nephew's names. Not her city, year, street name, career, or anything. Zilch. It's almost like he is just making this up. Sounds like a woman that died in her sleep and no one knows why. She talked to someone before she died, but what does that mean? A phone call, the doorman, a neighbor, someone at work ... and \"before\" means what? An hour? A day? It means whatever Horn wants it to mean. I've just re-listened to this exchange again; he does NOT mention a phone call. He clearly says, \"She had just talked to someone right before she had passed.\" Horn and the YouTube commenters keep insinuating that Henry said she was talking to someone on the phone ... nope!\n\nFinally, Henry gives up and asks Horn \"where ultimately did she actually pass away?\" Horn explains that her sister left the house at 1 a.m. in the rain, wearing all black and walked about a mile from the house. She crossed the street, and was hit and killed instantly by a car. The family does not know where she was going, but the autopsy showed that she had been drinking.\n\nHenry agrees with all of this, and said that it was not a suicide but he feels a lot of \"emotional up[s] and down[s].\"\n\nHenry mentions \u201cthey\u2019re having me talk about the Bill connection again. So, Bill was who now?\u201d Horn replies that Bill was her father\u2019s brother. Apparently about forty minutes are missing from the reading, and this was something that happened during that edit. If it were amazing, then the editors would have left it in.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also an acknowledgement of a Tom \u2026 connected to Bill \u2026 it could even be a middle name.\u201d\n\nAnd now to the platitudes. Key the feel-good music. I\u2019m not kidding that when you watch Henry\u2019s show \u201cHollywood Medium,\u201d they play music to tell you when to tear up and get that aww feel-good moment. Her father talks about how when he was dying he did not want a \u201ctube,\u201d and how happy he is for his daughter. He never worries about her and knows that she will be fine. He is at peace, he loves her, and everything is fine.\n\nI want to mention that Tyler Henry was going to become a hospice nurse before he got picked up by E! Network. He would know all about how people near the end of their life have tubes in their noses and mouths and how uncomfortable it is. I remember him telling Jodie Sweetin about how her grandmother hated the tubes also, and wanted them removed. I wonder how common that is, but it sounds impressively detailed to a sitter who is looking to believe in what is being said.\n\nWhat was missing might be as important as what was said. Henry missed anything that could be considered specific. He never knew anyone\u2019s names, careers, years of death or birth, hobbies, nothing. Everything he threw out was general, and he expected Horn to come up with the answers; who had a stroke, what is it about horses, the teacher thing, wedding rings, and altered jewelry. These are statements that will fit pretty much anyone if you are general enough. The names he mentioned are all common names (see the Social Security Database for popular names): Robert, Bob, Bobby, Tom, Ellen, Helen, Elaine, Pat, Patty, Patricia, and Lynn.\n\nLiving family members are being waved at by dead family members, but there\u2019s nothing like \u201cSara is doing so well in school, I watch her play the piano in church and am so proud of her good grades.\u201d Nothing like that at all.\n\nAs far as his stats are concerned, it\u2019s really difficult to say how many things he got wrong. Do we count every time he mentions something? Bob, Bobby, and Robert\u2014is that three wrong or just one? How can you even measure a statement with no specificity?\n\nWhat Henry did get right was that Horn wanted to hear from an older male. He eventually got her to tell him that it was her father, and the details of his death. The father acknowledged a younger female that is in college, and eventually he told Horn that he was happy for her. The other thing that Horn believes Henry was correct on was that he reached her sister and answered questions about her death. But we now know that isn\u2019t true at all. He reached a woman who was not ready to die, and then he extracted the rest of the details from Horn herself.\n\nIt\u2019s all very sad. The released reading was forty minutes long. Horn said the entire reading was eighty minutes long, and I believe her. The editors of this video have every incentive to leave in the very best parts of the reading, the best of the best. I can imagine how tedious the missing parts must be. Psychic expert Mark Edward often says, \u201cThe real magic happens in the editing room.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m sure that this detailed breakdown is unlikely to convince anyone who wasn\u2019t already convinced that psychics can\u2019t really communicate with the dead. But what I hope it does do is prove that, in this case, Tyler Henry does not need to know anything about the sitter beforehand to provide a believable reading. Horn and other Henry supporters, according to the comments on YouTube, are 100 percent behind this reading, calling it \u201cfabulous\u201d and Henry \u201cthe real thing.\u201d To people like myself, who are interested in the methods of psychic mediums, this video (and all the other readings I\u2019ve seen Henry perform) convince me that the statements made are equivalent to a person performing a cold-read.\n\nIf I had to score this reading, I would give Tyler Henry a big fat zero.\n\nThank you to Doug Dean for help with the transcripts; Mark Honeychurch and Stuart Jones for the editing and proofreading. Mark Edward for his expertise and support, and to the Chamberboys YouTube channel for bringing this video to my attention."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Janelle Mon\u00e1e is crying in her spacesuit. It\u2019s early April in Atlanta, and she\u2019s in one of the basement studios of her Wondaland Records headquarters, surrounded by computer monitors and TV screens, one of them running a screensaver that displays images of her heroes: Prince, Martin Luther King Jr., Pam Grier, Tina Turner, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, David Bowie. She\u2019s about to reveal, for the first time, something the world has long guessed, something her closest friends and family already know, something she\u2019s long been loath to say in public. As she sings on a song from her new album, Dirty Computer, \u201cLet the rumors be true.\u201d Janelle Mon\u00e1e is not, she finally admits, the immaculate android, the \u201calien from outer space/The cybergirl without a face\u201d she\u2019s claimed to be over a decade\u2019s worth of albums, videos, concerts and even interviews \u2013 she is, instead, a flawed, messy, flesh-and-blood 32-year-old human being.\n\nAnd she has another rumor to confirm. \u201cBeing a queer black woman in America,\u201d she says, taking a breath as she comes out, \u201csomeone who has been in relationships with both men and women \u2013 I consider myself to be a free-ass motherfucker.\u201d She initially identified as bisexual, she clarifies, \u201cbut then later I read about pansexuality and was like, \u2018Oh, these are things that I identify with too.\u2019 I\u2019m open to learning more about who I am.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a lovely spacesuit she\u2019s wearing, a form-fitting white NASA artifact complete with a \u201ccommander\u201d patch on one arm and an American flag on the other. She\u2019s put it on for no reason at all \u2013 there are no cameras in sight \u2013 as she lounges around Wondaland. The outfit is a remnant, perhaps, of the android persona, known as Cindi Mayweather, that she fed us all these years: a messianic, revolutionary robot who fell in love with a human and vowed to free the rest of the androids.\n\nEarly in her career, Mon\u00e1e was insecure about living up to impossible showbiz ideals; the persona, the androgynous outfits, the inflexible commitment to the storyline both on- and offstage, served in part as protective armor. \u201cIt had to do with the fear of being judged,\u201d she says. \u201cAll I saw was that I was supposed to look a certain way coming into this industry, and I felt like I [didn\u2019t] look like a stereotypical black female artist.\u201d\n\nShe is also a perfectionist, a tendency that\u2019s helped her career and hindered her emotional life; portraying a flawless automaton was also a bit of wish fulfillment. It\u2019s one of the many reasons she thought she had a \u201ccomputer virus\u201d that needed cleaning, which led her to years of therapy, starting before the 2010 release of her debut, The ArchAndroid. \u201cI felt misunderstood,\u201d she says. \u201cI was like, \u2018Before I self-destruct, before I become a confused person in front of the world, let me seek some help.\u2019 I was afraid for anybody to see me not at the top of my game. That obsession was too much for me.\u201d\n\nSo she overcompensated, as she puts it, leaving fans to puzzle over the sight and sound of a dark-skinned, androgynously dressed black woman creating Afro-futuristic fantasias as trippy as the Parliament-Funkadelic soundscapes she grew up hearing. She became a pop anomaly, a sometimes incongruous interloper in the universes of her earliest supporters, Big Boi and Puff Daddy, the latter having signed her to a partnership with Bad Boy Records in 2008. The ArchAndroid was a buzzy introduction, and 2013\u2019s Electric Lady \u2013 certainly the first progged-out concept album in the history of Bad Boy \u2013 established her as one of the 21st century\u2019s most inventive voices. Years before Frank Ocean, Solange, Beyonc\u00e9 and SZA pushed arty, alternative R&B to the mainstream, Mon\u00e1e was already there, bridging the gap between neo-soul and all that was to come, unafraid to fuse rock, funk, hip-hop (when she feels like it, as on her recent single \u201cDjango Jane,\u201d she\u2019s a top-flight rapper), R&B, electronica and campy, drama-kid theatricality.\n\nShe always ducked questions about her sexuality (\u201cI only date androids\u201d was a stock response) but embedded the real answers in her music. \u201cIf you listen to my albums, it\u2019s there,\u201d she says. She cites \u201cMushrooms & Roses\u201d and \u201cQ.U.E.E.N.,\u201d two songs that reference a character named Mary as an object of affection. In the 45-minute film accompanying Dirty Computer, \u201cMary Apple\u201d is the name given to female \u201cdirty computers\u201d taken captive and stripped of their real names, one of whom is played by Tessa Thompson. (The actress has been rumored to be Mon\u00e1e\u2019s girlfriend, though Mon\u00e1e won\u2019t discuss her dating life.) The original title of \u201cQ.U.E.E.N.,\u201d she notes, was \u201cQ.U.E.E.R.,\u201d and you can still hear the word on the track\u2019s background harmonies.\n\nMon\u00e1e is the CEO of her own label, a CoverGirl model and a movie star, appearing in the Oscar-winning Moonlight and the Oscar-nominated Hidden Figures, two hits led by black casts. In both films, she tackles black American stories that don\u2019t typically get the big-screen treatment. \u201cOur stories are being erased, basically,\u201d she says of her attachment to those scripts, which made her \u201cwant to tell my story.\u201d\n\nMon\u00e1e does worry that the human behind her masks may not be enough. She has asked aloud, including in therapy, \u201cWhat if people don\u2019t think I\u2019m as interesting as Cindi Mayweather?\u201d She\u2019ll miss the freedom of being the android. \u201cI created her, so I got to make her be whatever I wanted her to be. I didn\u2019t have to talk about the Janelle Mon\u00e1e who was in therapy. It\u2019s Cindi Mayweather. She is who I aspire to be.\u201d\n\nOn Dirty Computer, the only hints of sci-fi are in the title and the storyline of the accompanying film. The lyrics are flesh-and-blood confessions of both physical and emotional insecurity, punctuated with sexual liberation. They\u2019re the unfiltered desires of an overthinker letting herself speak without pause, for once. And she wants to help listeners gain the courage to be dirty computers too. \u201cI want young girls, young boys, nonbinary, gay, straight, queer people who are having a hard time dealing with their sexuality, dealing with feeling ostracized or bullied for just being their unique selves, to know that I see you,\u201d she says in a tone befitting the \u201ccommander\u201d patch on her arm. \u201cThis album is for you. Be proud.\u201d\n\nMon\u00e1e grew up in a massive, devoutly Baptist family in Kansas City, Kansas, or as she likes to put it, \u201cI got 50 first cousins!\u201d Not all of them know details of her romantic life, but they have almost certainly seen her wear sheer pants and share a lollipop with Thompson in the \u201cMake Me Feel\u201d video. \u201cI literally do not have time,\u201d she says, laughing, \u201cto hold a town-hall meeting with my big-ass family and be like, \u2018Hey, news flash!\u2019 \u201d She worries that when we visit Kansas City tomorrow, they\u2019ll bring it up: \u201cThere are people in my life that love me and they have questions, and I guess when I get there, I\u2019ll have to answer those questions.\u201d\n\nOver the years, she\u2019s heard some members of her family, mostly distant ones, say certain upsetting things. \u201cA lot of this album,\u201d she says, \u201cis a reaction to the sting of what it means to hear people in my family say, \u2018All gay people are going to hell.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe began questioning the Bible and her family\u2019s Baptist faith early on. Now, she says, \u201cI serve the God of love\u201d \u2013 love, she\u2019s determined, is the common factor among all religions, an idea Stevie Wonder expanded on in a Dirty Computer interlude.\n\nWhen we arrive in the flat, industrial Kansas side of Kansas City, her family doesn\u2019t actually have any questions \u2013 or anything unkind to say, for that matter. There\u2019s just a whole lot of love for their homegrown superstar.\n\nJanelle Mon\u00e1e Robinson was born here on December 1st, 1985, to a mom who worked as a janitor and a dad who was in the middle of a 21-year battle with crack addiction. Her parents separated when Mon\u00e1e was less than a year old, and her mother later married the father of Janelle\u2019s younger sister, Kimmy.\n\nMon\u00e1e\u2019s loving warnings about the sheer size of her family ring true as soon as we step into her old neighborhood. On one street, her maternal grandmother owned several homes in a row that housed cousins, aunts, uncles and Mon\u00e1e herself. A few minutes away is her paternal great-grandmother\u2019s pastel-coated house. Mon\u00e1e spent a significant portion of her time there \u2013 it was her main connection to her dad and his family as he went in and out of prison; their relationship was rocky until he got sober 13 years ago. Another short car ride away is her maternal Aunt Glo\u2019s home, where we meet her mom. \u201cShe\u2019s my favorite slice of pie,\u201d her Auntie Fats says, referring to Mon\u00e1e\u2019s familial nickname of \u201cpun\u2019kin.\u201d\n\nMon\u00e1e was raised in a working-class community called Quindaro. It started as a settlement established by Native Americans and abolitionists just prior to the Civil War, and became a refuge for black Americans escaping slavery via the Underground Railroad. A few weeks before our visit, vandals painted swastikas and \u201cHail Satan\u201d on a statue of abolitionist John Brown in the neighborhood. It\u2019s since been repainted. \u201cI know nobody in this neighborhood did that,\u201d her great-grandmother says, shaking her head. \u201cOutsiders.\u201d\n\nOn the Missouri side of the bridge, Kansas City is predominately white, but Mon\u00e1e\u2019s community is overwhelmingly black. \u201cI would read about where I was from,\u201d she says, \u201cand understand who\u2019s really disadvantaged coming from these environments. It sucks. It\u2019s like that for brown folks.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s hard to miss her family\u2019s religiosity \u2013 they hardly get a sentence out without a mention of God\u2019s blessings. At 91, Mon\u00e1e\u2019s great-grandma still monitors the halls at the local vacation Bible school with a switch in hand. During our visit, she sits behind a piano to lead a gospel singalong. Mon\u00e1e, beside an aunt and a cousin, joins in, belting \u201cCall Him Up and Tell Him What You Want\u201d and \u201cSavior, Do Not Pass Me By.\u201d\n\nMon\u00e1e is never more relaxed during our time together than when she\u2019s in Kansas City. Her Midwestern drawl comes back as she screams and sings while running into the arms of her cousins, aunts and uncles, many of whom she gets to see only during the holidays or tour stops nearby. At one point, she curls up into her mom\u2019s lap while they look at a homemade poster full of sepia-toned childhood pics. \u201cShe was a delightful baby,\u201d Auntie Fats recalls.\n\nMon\u00e1e\u2019s family members all share different versions of the same story: She was born to be a star, and she made that clear as soon as she gained motor skills. There was that time she got escorted out of church for insisting on singing Michael Jackson\u2019s \u201cBeat It\u201d in the middle of the service. There were the talent shows for Juneteenth where she covered \u201cThe Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\u201d three years in a row and won each time. She was the star of the school musicals, except for The Wiz her senior year, when she lost the role of Dorothy because she had to leave the audition early to pick up her mom at work. She\u2019s still a bit miffed about not getting that part.\n\nMon\u00e1e soon passed a bigger audition, for the American Musical and Dramatic Academy, and headed to New York. She studied musical theater and shared a small apartment with a cousin where she didn\u2019t even have a bed to herself. When she wasn\u2019t in class, she was working.\n\nMeanwhile, an old friend was having the college experience Mon\u00e1e desired, in Atlanta, so she relocated. The rest is well-trod history in the myth-building of Mon\u00e1e: She was an Afro\u2019d neo-soul singer strumming her guitar on college quads and working at Office Depot. She was fired from that job for using one of the company\u2019s computers to respond to a fan\u2019s e-mail, an incident that inspired the song \u201cLettin\u2019 Go.\u201d\n\nThat song caught the attention of Big Boi, who put her on Outkast\u2019s Idlewild and helped connect her with Sean Combs. \u201cI\u2019m-a be honest with you,\u201d her dad says, recalling an invite to one of Mon\u00e1e\u2019s shows in Atlanta, where Combs was supposed to be in the house. \u201cI was like, \u2018Yeah, right.\u2019 I didn\u2019t think Puff Daddy was coming.\u201d\n\nSkepticism aside, Michael Robinson was proud of the invite. He\u2019d recently gotten sober, and the two were repairing their relationship. He spent much of Janelle\u2019s childhood hearing about her immense talents from the more-present members of their family. He was honored that they had come far enough for Mon\u00e1e to want him to be there for such an important concert. But he still didn\u2019t believe Puffy would be there.\n\n\u201cI go down there with my two cousins, and she says, \u2018Dad, everyone\u2019s gonna know you\u2019re not from here. Your jeans are creased.\u2019 \u201d Fashion faux pas aside \u2013 he insists he hasn\u2019t creased his jeans since \u2013 Robinson was in for a pleasant surprise when one of his cousins spotted Combs and Big Boi in the back. It was the beginning of his daughter\u2019s new life, and he was just in time to be along for the journey. \u201cI remember thinking, \u2018This is what the big time is like,\u2019 \u201d he muses. \u201cThey had all the cameras, all the lights. It was all about Janelle.\u201d\n\nWondaland Arts Society\u2019s headquarters feels like a utopian synthesis of Mon\u00e1e\u2019s past lives in Kansas City and Manhattan. It sits inconspicuously in the midst of suburban Atlanta and looks like every other neighborhood home, with its two floors and brick exterior. Inside is much more ostentatious, with vintage clocks wallpapering the foyer, pristine white couches in the communal living spaces, and books and records everywhere.\n\nIt mimics the close-knit, constant accessibility of her childhood in Kansas City, with all its artists popping in and out of the space throughout each day to record new music, rehearse for shows and present the final product to the rest of the collective. At one point, the singer-rapper Jidenna shows up, having recently returned from a trip to Africa \u2013 everyone immediately starts teasing him about his newly buff physique.\n\nSimultaneously, Chuck Lightning, seemingly the more extroverted half of two-man funk act Deep Cotton, who make their own music as well as work with Mon\u00e1e, grabs a bowl of quinoa from the kitchen as Mon\u00e1e doles out decisions on which version of the \u201cPynk\u201d video will be released (they settle on the one without the spoken-word love poem that appears within the song in the film).\n\nMon\u00e1e recorded most of Dirty Computer here, in a small studio with Havana-inspired decor. Guests and collaborators ranged from Grimes to Brian Wilson, who added harmonies to the title track. The album\u2019s liner notes cite Bible verses and a recent Quincy Jones interview alongside Monica Sj\u00f6\u00f6\u2019s The Great Cosmic Mother and Ryan Coogler\u2019s Black Panther.\n\nBut she was particularly close to one inspiration. Mon\u00e1e was good friends with Prince, who personally blessed the album\u2019s glossy camp tone and synthed-out hooks. \u201cWhen Prince heard this particular direction, he was like, \u2018That\u2019s what y\u2019all need to be doing,\u2019 \u201d Lightning says. \u201cHe picked out that sound as what was resonating with him.\u201d Prince gave highly specific music and equipment recommendations from the era they were drawing on, including Gary Numan, whom he loved. \u201cThe most powerful thing he could do was give us the brushes to paint with,\u201d Lightning says.\n\nRumors spread that Prince co-wrote the single \u201cMake Me Feel,\u201d which features a \u201cKiss\u201d-like guitar riff. \u201cPrince did not write that song,\u201d says Mon\u00e1e, who sorely missed his advice during the production process. \u201cIt was very difficult writing this album without him.\u201d Prince was the first person to get a physical copy of The ArchAndroid \u2013 she presented the CD to him with a flower and the titles written out by hand. \u201cAs we were writing songs, I was like, \u2018What would Prince think?\u2019 And I could not call him. It\u2019s a difficult thing to lose your mentor in the middle of a journey they had been a part of.\u201d\n\nStevie Wonder was another early fan of Mon\u00e1e, and a conversation between them \u2013 Wonder insisted she record it \u2013 appears as an interlude on Dirty Computer. At one point, years ago, her budding friendships with both legends collided: She had to choose between playing with Prince at Madison Square Garden or with Wonder in Los Angeles. Prince encouraged her to pick Stevie.\n\nOn election night in 2016, Mon\u00e1e found herself experiencing an unfamiliar emotion. \u201cFor the first time,\u201d she says, \u201cI felt scared.\u201d Overnight, she went from living in a country whose president loved her music and had her perform on the White House lawn to one where it felt like her right to exist was threatened. \u201cI felt like if I wake up tomorrow,\u201d she says, \u201care people going to feel they have the right to just, like, kill me now?\u201d\n\nMon\u00e1e had already been a committed activist. In 2015, with members of Wondaland, she created \u201cHell You Talmbout,\u201d which demands we say the names of black Americans who have been victims of racial violence and police brutality. Before #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up, Mon\u00e1e created an organization, Fem the Future, which stemmed from her frustrations about opportunities for women in the music industry. She was called on to perform at the 2017 Women\u2019s March and to speak about Time\u2019s Up while introducing Kesha at the Grammys. \u201cWe come in peace, but we mean business,\u201d she told the cheering crowd.\n\nThat sums up Mon\u00e1e\u2019s mindset in the Trump era. She hopes not to destroy the oppressors but to change their minds. \u201cThe conversations might not happen with people in the position of power,\u201d she says, \u201cbut they can happen through a movie, they can happen through a song, they can happen through an album, they can happen through a speech on TV. Most of them will probably turn off their TVs, but . . .\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s in a New York hotel now, two weeks before the album\u2019s release. \u201cThere\u2019s some anxiety there, but I feel brave,\u201d she says, teetering between her typical sternness and a bit of vulnerable shakiness. No tears will be shed today. \u201cMy musical heroes did not make the sacrifices they did for me to live in fear.\u201d Her activism isn\u2019t the focus of Dirty Computer, but it\u2019s there, hovering above every note. She ended band rehearsal in Atlanta by asking the musicians to reflect on how American this album is. Mon\u00e1e\u2019s America is the one on the fringes; it accepts the outsiders and the computers with viruses, like the ones she thought she had.\n\nShe understands the significance of now making her personal life a bigger, louder part of her art. She cites the conversation around one of her films as an example of how she might use her own story to engage with more-conservative listeners. \u201cWhen I did Hidden Figures, there were some Republican white men tweeting about it and how they just felt bad. You could feel through their tweets that they were just like, \u2018These black women did help us get to space. How could we treat them like that?\u2019 \u201d\n\nMeanwhile, she\u2019s again anticipating questions from her family back in Kansas. She seems more worried about them than what anyone else has to say. Still, Dirty Computer is meant to be a celebration, and if she loses a few people along the way, Mon\u00e1e seems OK with that risk.\n\n\u201cThrough my experiences, I hope people are seen and heard,\u201d she says, sitting at a hotel-room desk, dressed up from a day of promo in a puffy black-and-red jacket, matching red pants and terry-cloth hotel slippers. \u201cI may make some mistakes. I may have to learn on the go, but I\u2019m open to this journey.\u201d She sighs, voice confident and stare unfaltering. \u201cI need to go through this. We need to go through this. Together. I\u2019m going to make you empathize with dirty computers all around the world.\u201d"}

especially high - and this year, some celebrities fell flat.\n\nThe worst:\n\nThis year's worst-dressed were mostly those who didn't incorporate the heavenly theme into their outfits - or did so to disastrous outcomes.\n\nKylie Jenner left viewers unimpressed with her secular ensemble, opting for a simple black gown and sunglasses indoors. Sister Kendall Jenner made the list as well.\n\nSarah Jessica Parker's Dolce & Gabbana ensemble captured attention, but not necessarily for the right reasons. Featuring an over-the-top gold headpiece and equally busy dress, the usually-fashionable actress's outfit was a lot to take in.\n\nScarlett Johansson looked beautiful, but her outfit was forgettable, as it had nothing to do with the theme. The same was true for Miley Cyrus, whose daring low-cut satin gown would have been better suited for a different red carpet.\n\nAnd Amal Clooney's outfit of flowers paired with pants by Richard Quin was gorgeous - but the co-host of the event didn't bring the dazzle that one expects from outfits at the Met Gala.\n\nOverall, this year's Met Gala, filled with extravagant headpieces and lots of gold, was one to remember.\n\nAs exhibition curator Andrew Bolton said of the theme: \"Dress is central to any discussion about religion.\""}
{"label": true, "txt": "UPDATED: The eyes of the world turned to Windsor in the British county of Berkshire on Saturday for the wedding of Prince Harry and U.S. actress Meghan Markle, with millions of people across the globe expected to tune in to the pomp and ceremony of the much-anticipated royal occasion. The BBC said an estimated 1.9 billion people were expected to watch around the world.\n\nThe couple will become the Duke and Duchess of Sussex after Prince Harry\u2019s new official title, conferred on him by Queen Elizabeth II, was announced Saturday morning. Prince Harry will become His Royal Highness The Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. Markle will be known as HRH The Duchess of Sussex.\n\nIt was a beautiful morning in Windsor as guests started to arrive at 9:30 a.m. local time (1:30 a.m. PT). Amongst the earliest arrivals at St. George\u2019s Chapel were American talk show legend and actress Oprah Winfrey; British actor Idris Elba; and British singer James Blunt. Ahead of the start of the service arriving guests are being treated to the music of classical composers including Johann Sebastian Bach, Ralph Vaughn Williams, Gustav Holst and Edward Elgar.\n\nArriving with minutes of each other around 10:25 a.m. were George and Amal Clooney; David and Victoria Beckham; and actress Carey Mulligan with her husband singer Marcus Mumford. Indian actress Priyanka Chopra arrived alongside Markle\u2019s \u201cSuits\u201d co-stars Gina Torres and Abigail Spencer shortly before 11 a.m. Other \u201cSuits\u201d actors Sarah Rafferty, Rick Hoffman and Gabriel Macht were close on their heels. Other celebrity guests include Elton John; James Corden; Tom Hardy; Serena Williams and her husband, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian; and British singer Joss Stone.\n\nGlobal viewers got their first brief glimpse of the bride in her car as she left the nearby Cliveden House Hotel, where Markle and her mother, Doria Ragland, stayed overnight. The bride left the hotel just before 11:20 a.m. local time.\n\nPrince Harry, and his older brother and best man Prince William, arrived at the venue at 11:35 a.m dressed in the frock-coat uniform of the Blues and Royals Household Cavalry. The Queen gave her permission for her grandson to get married in his uniform.\n\nMarkle arrived at Windsor Castle through the Cambridge Gate in a Rolls Royce Phantom IV at 11:48 a.m. She entered the chapel at one minute past noon to a special fanfare composed especially for the bride by the state trumpeters. The wedding dress was designed by British designer Clare Waight Keller from French fashion house Givenchy.\n\nThe Queen arrived at the chapel with her husband Prince Philip at 11:55 a.m., shortly after Prince Charles and his wife the Duchess of Cornwell.\n\nDozens of international media outlets have flocked to Windsor, including broadcasters from Canada, Australia and New Zealand, which recognize the British monarch as their head of state, and from other countries such as Germany, France, Spain and Japan. In total, more than 5,000 members of the media and their support staff have been accredited to be in Windsor for the wedding. In the U.S., NBC, CBS, ABC, CNN, BBC America, TLC, HBO, Hallmark, and E! are all offering a live stream with commentary.\n\nThe wedding fever reflects the global appeal of the British monarchy, which has been a staple of the news and entertainment industries for decades, if not centuries, from Shakespeare\u2019s history plays through to \u201cThe Lion in Winter,\u201d \u201cThe Queen,\u201d \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d and \u201cThe Crown.\u201d\n\nNBC has five different vantage points set up along the procession route leading to Windsor Castle, the venue for the wedding, with \u201cToday\u201d show anchors Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb fronting coverage from an exclusive vantage point overlooking the castle and with Megyn Kelly, Al Roker, Kathie Lee Gifford and Sheinelle Jones at other prime locations around Windsor.\n\nCBS sent \u201cThis Morning\u201d co-host Gayle King and \u201cEntertainment Tonight\u201d co-host Kevin Frazier to England, while ABC has a special five-hour extended edition of \u201cGood Morning America\u201d planned with Robin Roberts and \u201cWorld News Tonight\u201d anchor David Muir leading the coverage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fairy tale. Who doesn\u2019t love fairy tales?\u201d Libby Leist, \u201cToday\u201d executive producer, told Variety earlier this week. \u201cIt\u2019s all about history, it\u2019s about tradition, it\u2019s about fashion. It\u2019s got a little something for everybody, which is why we are going so big on it.\u201d\n\nIn Britain, the BBC is dedicating five hours of coverage to the royal nuptials on its flagship channel, BBC One. This is to be followed by a four-hour special, presented live from Windsor Castle and featuring reports from around the U.K. and elsewhere, on the BBC News channel. Britain\u2019s biggest commercial broadcaster, ITV, has scheduled more than five and a half hours of coverage, while pay-TV service Sky is devoting airtime to the wedding on both its Sky 1 and Sky News channels.\n\nInternational media on the ground in Windsor hail from 79 international networks and 46 U.S. broadcast affiliates. There are 160 photographers stationed in 14 officially designated locations. As well as via their local newscasters, viewers around the world can also tune in online via the royal family\u2019s official YouTube channel.\n\nThe 2011 royal wedding of Harry\u2019s older brother, Prince William, and Kate Middleton was watched by an estimated 27 million people in the U.K., 23 million in the U.S. and as many as 2 billion globally.\n\nToday\u2019s service, which begins at 12 p.m. local time (4 a.m. PT), is set to be followed by a 25-minute carriage procession offering thousands of onlookers, who have descended on Windsor, a first look at the newlyweds. Only 600 people were invited to the wedding of Harry, 33, and Markle, 36, but as many as 100,000 people from all over the world were expected to converge on Windsor. The historic market town, which is west of London, has a population of slightly more than 32,000.\n\nSecurity forces carried out a full run-through Thursday morning, traveling the same route the royal procession is to make on Saturday afternoon. All roads around Windsor Castle were blocked off, police snipers were stationed on rooftops, special commandos were posted in the crowds, and anti-vehicle barriers were erected in the town center.\n\nFollowing the wedding and procession, an official lunch reception hosted by Queen Elizabeth II is scheduled to take place in St. George\u2019s Hall for all invited guests. A second, more intimate evening reception for 200 guests, hosted by Prince Charles, will take place at 7 p.m. (11 a.m. PT) at Frogmore House, half a mile south of Windsor Castle.\n\nWhile the 2011 wedding of William and Kate at Westminster Abbey was attended by foreign dignitaries, royalty and politicians, the more intimate venue for Saturday\u2019s wedding meant only those with a personal relationship with the couple were invited. World leaders including British Prime Minister Theresa May and U.S. President Donald Trump were excluded. St. George\u2019s Chapel has a maximum capacity of 800. By contrast, 1,900 guests were invited to Prince William\u2019s wedding.\n\nIn March, Kensington Palace announced that 2,640 members of the public would be invited into the grounds of Windsor Castle to watch the arrivals and the carriage procession as it departed the castle afterwards. The announcement said the couple had asked that 1,200 people from across Britain, including \u201cyoung people who have shown strong leadership and those who have served their communities,\u201d be among the invitees.\n\nMarkle, whose first name is Rachel (Meghan is her middle name), is best known for her role as Rachel Zane on legal drama \u201cSuits.\u201d She has now retired from acting and will become a U.K. citizen following the wedding. In a BBC interview alongside Harry last November, she said: \u201cI don\u2019t see it as giving anything up. I just see it as a change. It\u2019s another chapter.\u201d\n\nThe couple first met on a blind date, arranged by a mutual friend, in July 2016, and managed to keep their relationship secret until late October of that year. The pair announced their engagement last November. Markle was previously married to producer Trevor Engelson; the marriage ended in divorce in 2013 after two years.\n\nFascination with the relationship has already seen six documentaries as well as TV movie \u201cHarry and Meghan: A Royal Romance\u201d produced about the couple and broadcast in the run-up to the wedding."}

{"label": true, "txt": "The time has finally come. The Real Housewives of New York City Season 10 trailer is here and there is so much drama fans won't know how to handle it. First off, this season's cast is the same as Season 9. That's right, Bethenny Frankel, Luann de Lesseps, Carole Radziwill, Dorinda Medley, Ramona Singer, Sonja Morgan, and Tinsley Mortimer are all returning for another season of madness, which premieres Wednesday, April 4.\n\nThe trailer opens up with fun, laughter, smiles, and ridiculousness, like this quote coming out of Sonja's mouth while she's dancing: \"This is the money move. Tuck in your penises.\" Oh, and the ladies partake in what appears to be a murder mystery dinner, but Ramona is more concerned about eating. \"Are we ready to die?\", she asks before adding, \"'Cuz I\u2019m really hungry.\"\n\nThere are even a few uplifting moments, including Bethenny helping those affected by the hurricane in Puerto Rico and Carole running the New York City Marathon.\n\nHowever, the drama quickly erupts and where to begin? Fans are probably dying to know if Luann's arrest will be featured, and, yes, that will be part of her storyline in the milestone 10th season. \"I\u2019ve been traveling, I\u2019ve been to prison, and I just want to be close to home,\" The Countess says after footage of her exiting rehab is shown. At one point, Luann declares, \"She called me a convict,\" but it remains unclear who made the comment.\n\nIn addition to her arrest, she even reflects on her failed marriage to Tom D'Agostino Jr. by telling her daughter, Victoria de Lesseps, \"I\u2019m moving on. In retrospect, why did I have to get married?\"\n\nLuann isn't the only one dealing with drama. Similar to last season, Tinsley and Sonja still don't seem to be getting along that well. Tinsley even yells at her former housemate: \"Shut your mouth and shut your f*cking legs!\" Yikes.\n\nAs for those who adore Bethenny and Carole's friendship, you better sit down for this one. It sure looks like their relationship isn't as tight as it used to be. \"I\u2019m not sure Carole is excited to see me as she used to be,\" the Skinnygirl mogul admits during her confessional. During the murder mystery event, they also have a heated exchange. \"Every time we\u2019re together you\u2019re aggressive with me,\" Carole says, but Bethenny denies it. \"Honey, it is,\" Carole says. To that, Bethenny says with some fire, \"Don\u2019t call me 'honey.'\"\n\nThis season sounds like it may be a rough one for Carole. She even says, \"It\u2019s probably the scariest place I\u2019ve ever been.\" Regarding that remark, it's not entirely clear what she's referring to, but there's a chance it could be about her relationship with Adam Kentworthy. Carole tells Tinsley, \"Adam says, 'I went on a date with someone and I like her.'\" If you recall, during the second part of the Season 9 reunion, Carole revealed she and Adam were taking a break, but it might be more permanent now.\n\nOn an even more serious note, Dorinda's drinking is a focus, but not in a funny way like it typically is. Bethenny says to her face, \"You\u2019re a drunk.\" Dorinda responds through tears, \"You know, I have a life now that\u2019s not the life that I expected.\"\n\nSpeaking of tears, Bethenny shares a sad moment with Jill Zarin at her late husband Bobby Zarin's funeral. Jill says to Bethenny while crying, \"What am I gonna do? I\u2019ve never been alone since I was 20 years old.\" Bethenny replies, \"I\u2019m alone, too.\" Could this be the moment that brings Bethenny and Jill back together? Fans will have to wait and see.\n\nThere's certainly a lot going on in the trailer, meaning Season 10 is going to be just as great as the rest of the RHONY series. And with that, here is a departing piece of wisdom from Dorinda that she tells Ramona in the sneak peek: \"Say it, forget it; write it, regret it.\"\n\nTo watch the trailer its entirety, head on over to People."}
{"label": true, "txt": "The 2018 SAG Awards were held last night, and though the focus on the #MeToo and #TimesUp movement wasn\u2019t as acute as it was at the Golden Globes, the theme of righting wrongs in Hollywood was very much still there. And coming off the Women\u2019s March just a couple days prior, we were all kind of riding that high of female empowerment in the face of adversity.\n\nSo it was a bit of a letdown to hear Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd\u2019s acceptance speech when he received his award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries for his role in Big Little Lies. Skarsg\u00e5rd plays Perry, an abusive husband in the HBO hit series, and in both his SAG Award acceptance speech and his acceptance speech for his Golden Globe he doesn\u2019t mention domestic abuse once. While we certainly don\u2019t place any of Perry\u2019s actions onto the actor, there is some cognitive dissonance in awarding a man for playing an abuser in a time when women are finally feeling emboldened enough to call out those who have abused them in real life, and then for that actor to completely ignore the subject of abuse when he\u2019s acknowledged for the role. You can watch his speech to see for yourself.\n\nTo add insult to injury, Skarsg\u00e5rd even manages to piss off veteran actor Robert DeNiro in the process, saying, \u201cA lot of people have been talking about who the greatest male actor ever is. Is it Mr. Robert DeNiro, or is it the tall guy from True Blood?\u201d DeNiro was nominated in the same category this year for his work in The Wizard of Lies, and while Skarsg\u00e5rd probably meant the comment to be a self-deprecating joke, DeNiro didn\u2019t seem to find the joke particularly funny.\n\nRobert DeNiro clearly must have better places to be #SAGAwards pic.twitter.com/xuWTIFmfwC \u2014 Samantha (@Samarsh_mallow) January 22, 2018\n\nOf course, winning a major award like this must be a jarring experience, but it\u2019s upsetting to see Skarsg\u00e5rd choose to stay silent on abuse for both acceptance speeches. It\u2019s even more frustrating when the subject of abuse is not only prevalent in the news, but directly impacts the award he\u2019s receiving. Choosing to not share the burden of upending systemic oppression keeps the fight completely on the backs of victims and stalls real change. Staying silent isn\u2019t really an option anymore, and it\u2019s frustrating to see Skarsg\u00e5rd shirk a prime opportunity to speak out against domestic violence. Many people have become more vocal and more active in the fight, but in order to really make things better, we all must do our part to speak out."}

I\u2019m a dog chasing cars. I wouldn\u2019t know what to do with one if I caught it! You know, I just \u2026 do things,\u201d his gruesomely made-up Joker insisted.\n\nPlan or no plan, the role of the Joker caught fire with the late actor\u2019s Oscar-winning performance as the agent of chaos, encouraging other serious thespians to take on Batman\u2019s archest villain \u2013 all while finding audiences eager to go for the wild ride.\n\nAs director Christopher Nolan\u2019s Dark Knight turns 10 this week, the anniversary arrives at a time of peak Joker.\n\nFor actors who aren\u2019t comic-book nerds, Ledger kicked that door open\n\nRobert Moses Peaslee\n\nJared Leto played the bad guy as a supporting character in 2016\u2019s Suicide Squad and will have his own Joker spin-off movie with Warner Bros. (as well as a film with lover Harley Quinn). On one end of the character spectrum, Zach Galifianakis voiced the Joker for laughs in 2017\u2019s The Lego Batman Movie , while on the other, Warner Bros. also just greenlit another Joker origin film starring Joaquin Phoenix.\n\n\u201cHeath Ledger\u2019s role has had a huge impact on the Joker,\u201d says Erik Davis, managing editor of the movie site Fandango.com. \u201cThe Dark Knight redefined a film genre and Ledger\u2019s Joker redefined a character, pushing it to an interest level we\u2019re still seeing.\u201d\n\nThe villain, created in 1940, had been a stand-out of the DC Comics universe long before Ledger, who died in 2008 from an accidental overdose of prescription medications, posthumously earned the best supporting actor Oscar.\n\nThe Joker was famously \u2013 and campily \u2013 portrayed on TV\u2019s Batman by Cesar Romero (1966 to 1968). Jack Nicholson brought a darker, still campy Joker performance to Tim Burton\u2019s 1989 Batman, but audiences never forgot that a global superstar was playing the part.\n\nWhen Ledger\u2019s casting was announced nearly two decades later, Nolan was initially criticised for choosing an actor known for his chiselled cheekbones over contenders such as Robin Williams and Paul Bettany.\n\n\u201cThere was backlash and controversy, like, \u2018How can he be the Joker?\u2019 \u201d says Access Hollywood film critic Scott Mantz. \u201cBut Ledger\u2019s Joker and The Dark Knight were monumentally different from anything we had seen before, or have seen since.\u201d\n\nLedger fully submerged himself in the maniacal villain who, opposite Christian Bale\u2019s brooding Batman, was electrifying and disturbing. His matinee idol looks were unrecognisable behind garish make-up and strung-out hair.\n\nThe transformation and the latitude he was given in the role was eye-opening for re-energised fans and Oscar-calibre actors like Leto and Phoenix, says Robert Moses Peaslee, co-editor of The Joker: A Serious Study of the Clown Prince of Crime.\n\n\u201cFor actors who aren\u2019t comic-book nerds, Ledger kicked that door open,\u201d says Peaslee. \u201cWith this twisted interpretation, there\u2019s so much room to play around. Ledger took it into the realm of serious project for serious actors.\u201d\n\nTroy Baker, who voices the Joker in video games such as Batman: Arkham Origins, believes there\u2019s room for more unique Joker performances but worries the influx could diminish the supervillain\u2019s mystique.\n\n\u201cNo one would be afraid of the devil if you saw him every day,\u201d says Baker. \u201cHe needs to remain in the shadows and pop out every once in a while to show that\u2019s where he lives.\u201d"}
{"label": true, "txt": "Secrets of the Royal romantic reunion that changed the course of history: What really made Kate and Wills rekindle their love - and transform the monarchy forever\n\nA new book reveals what really happened during their months apart\n\nPrince William and Kate Middleton broke up in March 2007\n\nIt was a spring of parties, incriminating photos and heartbreak\n\nThe royal couple got back together in June and married four years later\n\nIt was at the Cheltenham Festival, the great Spring celebration of National Hunt racing, that it first became clear. Dressed in matching, decades-older tweed outfits, William and Kate looked unhappy and out of sorts, in comparison to an event one year earlier when they had been spotted kissing in public for the first time. It was March 2007 and a rot had set into their relationship.\n\nAny lingering doubts were finally dispelled a few days later when William went out to Elements nightclub close to his barracks in Bournemouth.\n\n\n\nNormally so cautious in public, the Prince was now drunk, surrounded by glamorous half-naked girls \u2013 and enjoying himself.\n\n\n\nScroll down for video\n\n\n\nBreaking up: William speeds ahead of Kate at the 2007 Cheltenham festival in March\n\nIn one picture published in the following day\u2019s newspapers he appeared to be holding the breast of a fellow clubber, Brazilian Ana Ferreira. Another female party-goer said William had made suggestive comments. There was no longer any disguising the fact that William was unsure of his future with Kate.\n\nWhen his father Charles was wooing Diana and the relationship reached a crossroads, Prince Philip told him that he needed to take action one way or another. And Charles proposed.\n\nWhen William was faced with a similar dilemma he went the other way . . .\n\nThe last time Kate and William went out together before they split was with their friends Hugh and Rose van Cutsem, whose wedding they had attended two years earlier. At the end of March, the four had a quiet night out in the Van Cutsems\u2019 local, the King\u2019s Head pub at Bledington in the Cotswolds. By the time Kate flew to Ireland with her mother on April 3, their four-year relationship was over.\n\nKate was devastated, but instead of weeping at home, she kept herself busy. Kate and Carole had gone to Dublin to support one of Carole\u2019s friends, an artist who was showing a private exhibition. Mother and daughter saw the paintings, attended the champagne reception and then completed a cultural day with a tour of the National Gallery of Ireland.\n\nWilliam decided to celebrate the end of his relationship rather differently \u2013 with a trip to the Mahiki club in Central London. The news of their split was not yet public, but those around him had more than a clue of what was going on when he leaped on to a table, shouting \u2018I\u2019m free!\u2019.\n\nHe then slipped into his version of the robot dance \u2013 made famous by England footballer Peter Crouch \u2013 and suggested to his friends that they drink the menu.\n\nNews of their split broke in public the following day.\n\nPartying apart: When Prince William went clubbing at Elements in Bournemouth, and was caught with his hand apparently on Brazilian Ana Ferreira's breast, it was clear that him and Kate were no longer together\n\nYet it wasn\u2019t long before William was having second thoughts. Mindful, perhaps, of the decision his father had made when he was in his 20s and failed to marry his early love Camilla, William did not want to make the same mistake. Kate, however, needed some convincing. He had broken her heart and she wanted to make sure that if they did get back together it would be for the right reasons, and that things would change.\n\nShe signed up for a charity challenge with an all-female dragon boat racing crew called the Sisterhood, who billed themselves, A-Team style as: \u2018An elite group of female athletes, talented in many ways, toned to perfection with killer looks, on a mission to keep boldly going where no girl has gone before.\u2019\n\nWilliam spent the summer at his barracks, fulfilling Royal duties, playing polo and enjoying a few nights out with friends. Kate, meanwhile, said \u2018yes\u2019 to a slew of invitations and, in public at least, appeared more vibrant and sociable than she had been for some time.\n\nShe was soon joined in London by her sister Pippa, who had just finished university and moved into Kate\u2019s Chelsea flat. Spray-tanned and blow-dried, the two appeared together at a series of upmarket social events.\n\nKate was still only 25, a single girl with the world at her feet \u2013 and a taxi waiting outside. Although she was heartbroken, she wasn\u2019t going to show it.\n\nHer dresses grew shorter, her tops lower. April and May saw numerous nights out to hot-spots where she had been a regular with William, and she was frequently photographed \u2013 her swirl of brunette hair, bronzed limbs carefully folded \u2013 getting out of taxis in the West End.\n\nShe attended diverse events, including a reception at luxury jeweller Asprey for the launch of Young Stalin by Simon Sebag Montefiore and, on another night, attended a party to promote the film Rabbit Fever, which was about women obsessed with a brand of sex toy.\n\nGone were the frumpy tweeds of two months earlier; now Kate wore a slinky off-the-shoulder top and silky skirt with a bare midriff and caramel tan. Once inside the party she put on a pair of pink silk bunny ears and proceeded, as one party- goer put it, to \u2018tease all the boys\u2019.\n\nFunny bunny: Kate put on a pair of bunny ears during a party for a DVD launch celebrating a 'mocumentary' about the Rampant Rabbit vibrator in June 2007\n\nBut, for some time, Kate had wanted to edge towards a more stable lifestyle \u2013 preferring relaxed nights at home and family events \u2013 and, despite all appearances, she remained deeply hurt. Training with the Sisterhood helped distract her.\n\nThe 21 girls taking part in the venture were aiming to row across the Channel to raise money for children\u2019s hospices. It was an ambitious scheme: the team trained on the Thames from 6.30 in the morning and Kate, who had become involved through her old school friend Alicia Fox-Pitt, threw herself into it.\n\nFellow rower Emma Sayle recalls her state of mind: \u2018Kate was very down and I think the training became her therapy. Kate had always put William first and she said this was a chance to do something for herself.\u2019\n\nShe very quickly proved herself.\n\n\u2018It wasn\u2019t a question of, \u201cOh, she\u2019s Kate Middleton so she makes the team,\u201d\u2019 said Emma. \u2018She has had to prove herself. We launched the challenge in November and Kate joined in April. Our coach said she could only join if she was up to it.\u2019\n\nThanks to years of sport and a regime of tennis and swimming, Kate was more than up to the task.\n\nLater, she would see this time apart from William as valuable in its own right. \u2018I think at the time I wasn\u2019t very happy about it, but actually it made me a stronger person, you find out things about yourself that maybe you hadn\u2019t realised,\u2019 she said. \u2018I think you can get quite consumed by a relationship when you\u2019re younger. I really valued that time for me as well, although I didn\u2019t think it at the time!\u2019\n\nShe was still licking her wounds when she headed to Ibiza for some sun and headspace with her brother James and friends, including Marlborough classmate Emilia d\u2019Erlanger. They stayed at Kate\u2019s Uncle Gary\u2019s villa, where Gary\u2019s wife noticed that Kate spent a lot of time on the phone. William meanwhile was discovering that in Kate he\u2019d had what he wanted all along.\n\nThey secretly got back together on June 9, when she attended a party at his barracks to celebrate the end of training. The theme was \u2018Freakin\u2019 Naughty\u2019 and William wore hot pants, vest and a policeman\u2019s helmet, while Kate was dressed as a naughty nurse.\n\nBack together again: Prince William and Kate are snapped leaving Bouji's nightclub in October, appearing more in love than ever\n\nThere were blow-up dolls hanging from the ceiling and sexy waitresses handing out lethal cocktails. Outside was a bouncy castle and plunge pool, but William and Kate stuck to the dance floor. That night, she stayed at his barracks.\n\n\n\nWilliam later said, \u2018We were both very young . . . we were both finding ourselves and being different characters. It was very much trying to find our own way and we were growing up so it was just a bit of space and it worked out for the better.\u2019\n\nThey tried not to make it too obvious, but they were together one month later, on July 7, when Princes William and Harry stood on stage at Wembley in front of 63,000 people.\n\nThe two princes had decided to honour the ten-year anniversary of their mother\u2019s death with a tribute concert on what would have been her 46th birthday. Slipping into their seats in the Royal box, Harry sat next to his girlfriend Chelsy Davy, while William sat next to his best friend Thomas van Straubenzee.\n\nHowever, two rows back was Kate, accompanied by her brother James. The concert rocked to the sounds of Take That, Duran Duran and P. Diddy, while cousins Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, Peter and Zara Phillips, and Earl Spencer\u2019s daughters Kitty, Eliza and Katya all sang and danced. The evening was a huge success.\n\nThat night both princes had the women they loved by their sides. Harry and Chelsy had been together for three years and had also had their ups and downs. But for William and Kate, they were done with break-ups and make-ups, this time they wanted to be together forever.\n\nWilliam and Harry had wanted to thank everyone involved with the concert and did so with an extravagant party.\n\n\n\nThere were tropical fish swimming below a Perspex dance floor, oysters and raspberry vodka jellies being passed around, and dancers in cages.\n\nKate had worn a respectable white Issa mac to the concert, but for the party she slipped it off to reveal a thigh-skimming white-lace slip dress, and she danced with William to one of their favourite tracks, Bodyrockers\u2019 I Like The Way (You Move) before finding a discreet corner \u2013 lit by candles and scattered with rose petals \u2013 to sip mojitos, kiss and whisper in each other\u2019s ears.\n\nHappy ending: Prince William and Kate Middleton married on 29th April 2011, just over four years after their break-up - and two years before the impending arrival of Baby Cambridge\n\nA few weeks later, they were together again for Camilla\u2019s 60th birthday party at Highgrove. It was a black-tie event, and Kate wore a long cream dress and sipped champagne as William mouthed the words of It Had To Be You to her.\n\nShe had been smuggled in to avoid publicity, but once inside the pair were happily ensconced, enjoying the glow of this new honeymoon period.\n\nOne downside to her reunion with William was that, unfortunately, she needed to pull out of the race with the Sisterhood. She had wanted to complete the challenge, and William was behind her.\n\n\n\nBut it would have been hard to request privacy for her relationship while at the same time appearing to court publicity with the Sisterhood.\n\nKate and William had a lot to discuss, and some lost time to make up for. In September, they flew to the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean. They stayed at the Desroches Island Resort, checking in under the names \u2018Martin and Rosemary Middleton\u2019, and went kayaking and snorkelling in the shallow coral reef.\n\nAt night they relaxed over a candlelit supper on the beach. It was during this break that they made an agreement with each other.\n\nFor the next few years, they would work and enjoy their lives, knowing that at some point when the time was right, they would be husband and wife \u2013 and perhaps parents too.\n\nKate is published by Michael O\u2019Mara, priced \u00a320.

The couple, who have been together since last year and announced their engagement on the morning of 27 November, looked very much in love as they sat down with the BBC's Mishal Husain for their television appearance, and spoke about Harry's romantic proposal and their whirlwind romance.\n\nTalking about the stunning engagement ring, Prince Harry turned conversation to his late mother in an incredibly emotional way. \"The ring is - is obviously yellow gold because that's her favourite - and the main stone itself I sourced from Botswana and the little diamonds either side are from my mother's jewellery collection to make sure that she's with us on this on this crazy journey together,\" Harry revealed.\n\nMORE: Why Meghan and Harry are so perfect for each other\n\nWhen asked what it meant to have Princess Diana's diamonds on her engagement ring, the American actress, 36, replied, \"I think everything about Harry's thoughtfulness is - and the inclusion of that and obviously not being able to meet his mom it's so important to me to - to know that she's a part of this with us. And I think in being able to meet his aunts and - and also like Julia and just different people who were so important to his mom, I'm able to, in some way, know a part of her through them and of course through him.

The cast has completed filming, however, having taped the reunion special earlier this month.\n\n\"After six seasons on Bravo\u2019s [Real Housewives of New York City], I have decided to return to what I do best \u2014 journalism and producing,\u201d Carole writes. \u201cI am sure this does not come as a surprise to any of the viewers, all of whom have been supportive, encouraging, and kind.\u201d\n\nThe show\u2019s current season has largely focused on Carole\u2019s falling out with one-time bestie Bethenny Frankel. The duo has been locked in a fight over growing pains in their friendship since the season premiere, though it\u2019s never been made totally clear what their fight is about exactly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled to leave frenemies behind,\u201d Carole notes in her statement, seemingly a nod to Bethenny. The timing of Carole\u2019s exit announcement is somewhat poetic, as she once joked that the summer of 2018 would be her \u201clast great summer.\u201d\n\nThe former ABC news producer and author, who has penned both a memoir and a novel, joined RHONY in its fifth season after a major cast overhaul, which saw the exits of original stars Jill Zarin and Alex McCord. At the time, Carole wasn\u2019t the typical Housewife, a young widow who came from the world of hard news.\n\n\u201cMy original curiosity about reality television has waned over the years,\" Carole\u2019s statement continues. \u201cI am focusing on TV and writing projects that better suit my more steady temperament. I have worked with amazing producers, made great friends \u2026 I will remember this entire experience with delight, humor, and a veracious accuracy. Next.\u201d\n\nCarole appeared to further address her exit on Instagram, sharing a post that simply said, \"Didn't change, just learned,\" which might be a response to unsupportive viewers.\n\nBravo has not revealed if any other cast changes will be made ahead of RHONY\u2019s 11th season. The current lineup includes Ramona Singer, Luann de Lesseps, Sonja Morgan, Dorinda Medley and Tinsley Mortimer, in addition to Carole and Bethenny.\n\nThe Real Housewives of New York City airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\n\u2018Real Housewives of New York City\u2019: Bethenny and Carole's Fight Ramps Up in Colombia (Exclusive)\n\nWatch the First Footage From \u2018The Real Housewives of New York City\u2019 Cast\u2019s \u2018Cruise From Hell\u2019\n\nAndy Cohen Addresses \u2018Real Housewives of New York City\u2019 Cast\u2019s \u2018Cruise From Hell\u2019 (Exclusive)"}

(Photo: Matt Rourke, AP)\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 A judge has ruled Meek Mill should remain behind bars while appealing a prison sentence for violating probation, saying the rapper's drug use, arrests and other issues while under supervision merited the jail time.\n\nJudge Genece Brinkley turned down Mill's bid for release on bail in a ruling late Thursday while he appeals the 2- to 4-year sentence she issued for what she said was his fifth probation violation.\n\nThe judge also defended herself against attacks by Mill's legal and public relations team, which continued after her latest decision.\n\n\"This court has impartially and without prejudice presided over numerous proceedings in this matter since 2008, long before his current counsel became involved one week before the violation of probation hearing,\" Brinkley wrote. \"None of the allegations by (the) defendant constitute evidence that this court is unable to act impartially and without personal bias or prejudice with respect to this matter.\"\n\nMore: Meek Mill could be freed: Arresting cop may have lied, DA won't oppose rapper's release\n\nShe said Mill has raised \"unmeritorious claims of impropriety in an attempt to unfairly judge shop.\"\n\nAn attorney for Mill, Joe Tacopina, said in a statement Monday that the latest ruling \"reaffirms the fact she has turned Meek Mill's case into a personal vendetta.\"\n\nHe pointed to a statement two weeks ago by city prosecutors, who said they are not opposed to having Mill released on bail because of what they said was a likelihood the original conviction may be partly or completely reversed. The arresting officer in Mill's case was among the police officers the prosecutor's office has sought to keep off the stand because of credibility questions.\n\nThe DA's office also said it has a policy of generally not requesting more than six to 12 months for technical violations of probation and parole.\n\nBrinkley said in a lengthy opinion that jail time was warranted because during probation, Mill, 30, tested positive for opiates, got arrested in St. Louis and New York and made travel or performance plans without getting the required approval.\n\nMill's lawyers have asked the state Supreme Court to let him out on bail and to replace Brinkley as the presiding judge in the case.\n\nMill was charged in March 2017 with assault for an alleged fight in the St. Louis airport, charges the judge said were later reduced to summary offenses. He was then charged in August with felony reckless endangerment for allegedly driving an all-terrain vehicle in New York City, a matter resolved by \"a negotiated resolution\" through a diversionary program that required him to perform community service\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2pZJovg"}

{"label": true, "txt": "Tristan Thompson has left the building, you guys! TBH, I totally thought Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian would be the first one to split from casa Thompson and head for L.A. in the wake of the cheating scandal that reportedly rocked her world \u2014 and mine! \u2014 but it looks like her baby daddy is the one who's on the move. Tristan Thompson left Cleveland one week after Kardashian gave birth in order to head for Indianapolis for the NBA playoffs. Is the Revenge Body star relieved to finally be alone with her daughter, True? Probably. Like, give the girl some space, dude!\n\nAccording to People, Kardashian can't wait to get out of Ohio, but is stuck there with little True until her doctors give her the thumbs up to fly home to Cali. Meanwhile, Thompson and the rest of the Cleveland Cavaliers are in Indiana for their playoff games against the Pacers on April 20 and 22. Can't wait to see if the crowd boos him again like they did during Game 1. Is it bad sportsmanship? Sure, but in this situation I'm not totally against it.\n\nThe trip is the first time Thompson has left Cleveland since True was born on April 12, amid reports (and the release of some pretty damaging video) that he cheated on Kardashian while she was pregnant with his child. Elite Daily reached out to Kardashian and Thompson's teams about the cheating report but did not hear back by the time of publication. And while some outlets have reported that KoKo has already forgiven him, a source reportedly told TMZ that the two actually aren't even speaking. Elite Daily reached out to Kardashian and Thompson's teams regarding both reports but did not hear back by the time of publication.\n\n\"Khlo\u00e9 has not spoken to Tristan for several days because she's still furious after finding out he repeatedly cheated on her, and embarrassed her in the process,\" the source said. I so don't blame her! Which is why I was kind of shocked when the new mama took to Instagram on April 16 to let fans know that she had given her baby girl Thompson's last name.\n\n\"Our little girl, True Thompson, has completely stolen our hearts and we are overwhelmed with LOVE,\" she wrote in the caption. \"Such a blessing to welcome this angel into the family! Mommy and Daddy loooooove you True!\"\n\nThis whole thing is just so devastating because I really wanted Kardashian to get her happy ending after everything she went through with Lamar Odom. Instead, we've got this nightmare of a story that I still can't believe is actually real. Can't someone just make it all go away?\n\nAccording to another report from TMZ, Kardashian was actually super conflicted about what last name to give True after she found out her man had been stepping out on her. And really, who could blame her? Elite Daily reached out to Kardashian and Thompson's teams regarding the report but did not hear back by the time of publication. A source told the site that the reality star chose the name True about a month ago, and decided that her daughter's last name would be her father's. But then the whole cheating thing went down a few days before Kardashian went into labor, and Kardashian was reportedly torn about whether to go with Kardashian or Thompson on the birth certificate. As we now know from her post, she ended up going through with Thompson as originally planned, and I can only imagine Mama Kris' reaction to hearing the news was something along the lines of this:\n\nTotally get it, Kris! I really wanted KoKo to call an audible, too. But this is her baby and her life, and I'll just have to respect her decision \u2014 even if I totally think it's the wrong one."}
{"label": true, "txt": "Nia Jax is not like most girls and wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. An imposing figure in the ring, the WWE superstar walks confidently down the aisle before every match. The strength she exudes combined with overall self-assuredness have made her a role model for those who might find it difficult to embrace who they are in life.\n\nJax is cognizant of this, which is a reason she signed on to join the Total Divas cast last year. The E! reality series became a way for her to show different sides, even the insecurities. The Raw performer believed it was a chance for audiences to get a better glimpse who she is as a person.\n\n5 Dream Matches for WWE's Inaugural All-Women's PPV Event, 'Evolution' We are already thinking of the potential showdowns featuring current WWE female superstars & legends mixing it up for the historic event.\n\n\u201cComing on to the WWE scene, I was different and bigger than everybody, so everyone didn\u2019t know how to take me,\u201d she said. \u201cI could tell fans were like, \u2018Well, she is supposed to be a bad guy. Do we hate her? Do we make fun of her because of her size? She does some cool things the other girls can\u2019t do. Do we cheer that?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2026I\u2019m bubbly. I \u2018m loud. I like to have fun. I am always down for a party, and if there is drama, I like to nip that in the bud. I feel like it opened myself to our current WWE fans to see what my personality was off camera.\n\n\"Then the new fans on Total Divas who see me as a different person. A breath of fresh air and something they don\u2019t see on TV as often. A bigger girl kind of embracing herself and really living life without any apologies. It has been great. I love being part of Total Divas. I love our cast. It\u2019s a different cast this year, but last year I loved the cast as well. I had a great time filming. I feel like this season is probably our best season yet.\u201d\n\nJax could feel a genuine appreciation for her positive message on social media and during appearances. She returned to the plus-sized celebration known as Curvy Con for a second time with fellow Total Divas cast member Nikki Bella, who was the first \u201cstraight-sized\u201d women invited to the event. The two took the main stage to discuss body positivity and the importance of supporting each other on their respective journeys.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a party of encouraging, inspiring women,\u201d Jax said. \u201cIt has a lot to do with fashion, but it has a lot to do with encouraging people to be themselves. Last year, I was on such a high from it that I remember talking to Nikki Bella and Brie Bella and saying, \u2018You guys need to come here.\u2019 They were starting their Birdiebee line and including plus size.\n\n\u201cI told them they needed to bring a popup shop to Curvy Con because you don\u2019t understand the reach that it has. It\u2019s during New York Fashion Week, which is huge. But the impact that it has on women.\n\n\"This year when I got to do it with Nikki by my side, it was on another level. We got to be on a panel. It was so cute because we were backstage, and Nikki said, \u2018I\u2019m so nervous.\u2019 I said, \u2018Why would you be so nervous?\u2019 She said it was out of her comfort zone. It was an honor to join such influential people like Venus Williams and Gabourey Sidibe there.\u201d\n\nJax was also grateful to receive a People\u2019s Choice nomination for \u201cGame Changer of the Year\" and recently accepted the Association of National Advertisers' #SeeHer Now Award. Her drive and passion to put good in the world is likened to cousin of Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson. She hopes to continue being an example for season eight of Total Divas. For Jax, having cameras around the second time around during taping was easier.\n\n\u201cI became used to it,\u201d she said. \u201cEven before I was on Total Divas, Total Divas was filming backstage when I was on NXT. I did a Breaking Ground with NXT as well, so I got a little taste of having cameras follow me with the experience of my mom coming to my first-ever wrestling match on TV. It\u2019s pretty easy just because I feel like I\u2019m a pretty cut and dry person.\n\n\u201cYou know exactly what you\u2019re getting from me. I don\u2019t change how I am when I\u2019m on camera than when I\u2019m off camera. It was a little different because I was a lot busier this season when I became the women\u2019s champion at WrestleMania.\n\n\"Obviously, when you\u2019re the champion there are a lot more things required of you. My schedule got busy pretty quickly, which I was grateful for. However, with the cameras there you feel like you\u2019re doing three different jobs running at the same time.\u201d\n\nJax is excited for fans to see what winning the title from Alexa Bliss at WWE\u2019s biggest event of the year meant to her. Looking back today, she realizes what a huge impact it had. When they were approached with a storyline revolving around body shaming and best friend backstabbing, Jax recalls Bliss feeling uncomfortable with some of the things that were written.\n\n\u201cI said to her, \u2018Look, this is a huge storyline. This is something people go through.\u2019 Not just body shaming, but body image in general that Alexa had to deal with growing up. That I\u2019ve dealt with. I feel like everyone has dealt with this at some point. We had to go in, like really go in on this storyline,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe agreed. I told her, \u2018Stuff you\u2019re going to say is going to hurt. But at the end of the day I feel like this is going to be a bigger thing that we realize.\u2019 Talking to fans and fans approaching me to tell me how it really touched them. They could relate to what we were going through within the storyline.\n\nFormer WWE Superstar Stu Bennett Building Career Outside the Ring The former Wade Barrett is the leading man in the movie 'I Am Vengeance' and among the hosts of 'Ultimate Beast Master: Survival of the Fittest' on Netflix\n\n\"Then to see everyone stand behind me when I won the title at WrestleMania, it changed my life. It completely made me appreciate everything that we got to do. It made me realize the platform we do have in WWE and the reach it has.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so grateful we were able to tackle that storyline because it\u2019s something that was real. People need to see it. People were questioning why we were doing this. And saying, \u2018How dare they have Alexa say that.\u2019 I sat back saying, \u2019Yes, let her say those things because this is real life. It happens. We need to tackle it. Young kids watch our product, and they\u2019re going through it.\u2019\n\n\"To be able to see some of their favorite superstars going through it and then being able to relate. I get to beat my bully and win the title at WrestleMania. That\u2019s the biggest moment in my career so far. It\u2019s really cool.\u201d\n\nRather than finding love and a boyfriend, Jax says the season centers more on coming into her own and becoming more independent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about winning the women\u2019s championship and buying my first house by myself,\u201d she said. \u201cWelcoming Paige back. That is a huge thing this season. Paige had a pretty rough year before she came back. She made her comeback, got injured again. She had to transform into this amazing general manager. She is just so incredibly talented. I feel like this season you will see a lot of her and I having a lot of fun.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of antics that go on between us. That\u2019s the first thing we do when we get together. It becomes what kind of trouble can we cause, or practical joke can we pull.\n\n\"Now that she is on SmackDown we can\u2019t pull much, but any time there is a combined Pay-Per-View that is what we do. It becomes let\u2019s get together and wreak some havoc. This season I feel like there is a lot of stuff, but my personal favorite is Paige is coming back and everyone gets to see the journey she has gone through. They get to see how strong she is and all the things she had to overcome to get where she is today.\u201d\n\nJax couldn\u2019t be prouder with the recent steps forward taken by WWE for the female roster. She has enjoyed watching the second annual Mae Young Classic. Perhaps scoping out future opponents.\n\n\u201cI saw a little of it because I wanted to hear my Renee [Young] and Beth [Phoenix] on there,\u201d Jax said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m pretty impressed with Toni Storm. I like her style. The one football marking she puts under her eye. It\u2019s like she is ready to go. She has a cool style about her. It\u2019s so cool to see something like the Mae Young Classic. These women are such a diverse group. I feel like even in WWE it\u2019s the most diverse roster it has ever been.\n\n\u201cThen to see all these other women just kicking butt. These girls are not only working hard in the Mae Young Classic, but they are working year-round and get to showcase it here in WWE and the Network.\n\n\"It\u2019s so cool to watch because it\u2019s not only inspiring us to see what is up-and-coming with the next generation of WWE but inspires us to get better and continue what we are doing. Keep pushing on and break the glass ceilings and break the molds and realize that there is no limit to what we can do.\u201d\n\nOn the horizon is the inaugural all-women\u2019s Pay-Per-View Evolution on October 28. When the announcement was made, she had one dream match in mind.\n\n\u201cI thought it would be cool if me and my cousin Tamina teamed up against Beth and Nattie,\u201d Jax said. \u201cFour powerful women and two powerhouse teams against each other.\u201d\n\nAfter losing the women\u2019s championship earlier in the summer, Jax has been relatively off TV recovering from ailments and training to be back better than ever.\n\nThough viewers didn't have to wait that much longer for the irresistible force to return. She began the comeback on Raw after Hell in a Cell teaming with Ember Moon just in time for the build to the historic all-women's PPV.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be at Evolution for sure,\u201d Jax said. \u201cNow people are saying I\u2019m doing so well, I feel I owe it to them to keep it up. The pressure. I got to go get it back from Ronda.\u201d\n\nTotal Divas, Season 8 premiere Wednesday, September 19, 9/8c, E!"}

{"label": true, "txt": "Wednesday, June 14, 2017 by\n\nIt seems like just about anything can go viral these days. We have viral memes, viral videos, viral haircuts, and even viral foods. (Looking at you, Starbucks Unicorn Frap, RIP). Another category we see a lot of viral action from is beauty products.\n\nJust think about how often your Insta feed is plagued with beauty bloggers posing with products. It probably accounts for about 87 percent of the things you see. Despite all of the thousands of products that they sing the praises of, there are some that capture everyone\u2019s attention and everybody wants in on them.\n\nWhile some are definitely over-hyped, there are other beauty products that are definitely worth all of the love poems and heart emojis. So how do you separate the good stuff from the fluff? I\u2019m here to help you out. Have a look at 16 viral beauty products that are actually worth the hype.\n\n1. Becca Champagne Pop by Becca\n\nBuy for $38 from Sephora\n\nThere are certain products that have cult followings and then there are certain shades. This one falls into the latter category. There are tons of highlighters hitting the shelves, but this one was a standout thanks to its prismatic finish and unique but oh-so-flattering color.\n\n2. Molly Cosmetics Silisponge\n\nBuy for $9.90 from Molly Cosmetics\n\nPeople are still obsessed with their beautyblenders, but when the SiliSponge came along, it made people realize that there are other equally awesome sponges out there. The facts that it promised no makeup waste and hygienic use were enough to convince people. However, I\u2019m sure the fact the sponge looked like a gel bra pad definitely helped matters.\n\n3. Savage Blackhead Peel-Off Black Mask\n\nBuy for $16.99 from Savage\n\nI know you have seen the viral videos and photos of this mask. And let me tell you that they aren\u2019t cleverly edited. The black mask delivers results and it delivers them quickly. You can kiss pesky blackheads goodbye after a few uses.\n\n4. Storybook Cosmetics Wizard Wands\n\nBuy for $55 from Storybook Cosmetics\n\nThe beauty industry was a lot less fun before Storybook Cosmetics came into town with its themed brushes and makeup products. These Wizard Wands managed to captivate those who were Harry Potter fans and those who didn\u2019t know the difference between Dumbledore and Hogwarts. And what really sealed the deal was that the brushes were as easy to use as they were gorgeous.\n\n5. Unicorn Lashes Unicorn Makeup Brushes\n\nBuy for $60 from Unicorn Lashes\n\nYou know a product is good when people are willing to ship it halfway around the world, regardless of postage and duty charges. That\u2019s the case with these gorgeous unicorn makeup brushes. They\u2019re cute, high quality, and they actually make your makeup application easier.\n\n6. Kat Von D Alchemist Holographic Palette\n\nBuy for $32 from Sephora\n\nPretty much every Kat Von D product could be featured on this list. This highlighter palette in particular is a winner because it managed to stand out despite the fact 5,000 highlighters are released every year. (That may be a slight exaggeration.) And the palette managed to convince people that you really should be wearing blue, green, and purple highlighters\u2026and sometimes at the same time.\n\n7. BioBelle #UnicornGlow\n\nBuy for $5.99 from BioBelle\n\nWhen a product has a lot of hype before it\u2019s actually released, I become dubious about just how good it actually is. This mask lived up to expectations in terms of Instagram appeal and skin-perfecting benefits. It\u2019s made with good-for-your-skin ingredients that help nourish and hydrate. Plus, the packaging and the actual sheet mask slay.\n\n8. Dr. Brandt Skincare Magnetight Age-Defier\n\nBuy for $75 from Sephora\n\nIt\u2019s a mask with a magnet, how cool is that? This could easily be written off as a gimmick, but the product is actually legit. It uses the magnetic currents to help fight the signs of aging. And even people who have no interest in anti-aging products wanted to use it ASAP.\n\n9. The Ordinary Retinol 1%\n\nBuy for $6.90 from The Ordinary\n\nMeet the product that is turning people who aren\u2019t skincare fans into skincare obsessives who can talk at length about the differences between salicylic acid and lactic acid. The super long waiting lists are a good clue the products are worth it, but all the proof you really need is when you look in the mirror.\n\n10. Sigma Beauty Lip Switch\n\nBuy for $14 from Sigma Beauty\n\nThe *mysterious* name definitely attracted people, but it was the major finish that made these lippies a clear winner. Just a dab will help you unleash your inner unicorn thanks to the dazzling prismatic finish. When Sigma says that glosses \u201cbroke the internet,\u201d the brand is not exaggerating.\n\n11. Winky Lux Flower Balm Jelly Lip Stain\n\nBuy for $14 from Winky Lux\n\n\n\nIt has an actual flower in it, you guys. Obviously, that helped make it go viral, but this isn\u2019t all show and no substance. The magical lippie goes on clear then adjusts to a custom pink shade based on your body\u2019s pH. How\u2019s that for awesome chemistry?\n\n12. Anastasia Beverly Hills Moon Child Glow Kit\n\nBuy for $40 from Anastasia Beverly Hills\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve after an alien-like glow, look no further than this palette. It\u2019s the stuff that flawless Instagram beauty looks are made of. And what really makes it is that it looks as good IRL as it does online.\n\n13. Kylie Cosmetics Lip Kit\n\nBuy for $29 from Kylie Cosmetics\n\nDoes this one even need an explanation? Nah. Considering that Kylie Jenner has released about 438 different liquid lipsticks and each one still causes pandemonium, you know that they are worth it. And considering that everyone and their mama has released a liquid lipstick, but people keep going back to Kylie\u2019s definitely says something.\n\n14. Lush Scrubee\n\nBuy for $7.95 from Lush\n\nYou know that a product is good when it goes from being limited edition to being made part of the permanent collection. That\u2019s exactly what happened with Scrubee. Yeah, part of the appeal is that its shaped like an adorable bee, but the delicious scent and its nourishing qualities make it a winner.\n\n15. FLiRT Cosmetics Flashes Lash Applicator\n\nBuy for $28 from FLiRT Cosmetics\n\nTBT false lashes can be waaaaay more effort than they\u2019re worth. However, FLiRT Cosmetics changed the game with its lash applicator. The tool looks like a White Out dispenser but actually dispenses sections of fake lashes into the perfect spot.\n\n16. Forever 21 Rainbow Highlighter\n\nBuy for $5.90 from Forever 21\n\nThe highlighter that launched the obsession. If you were lucky enough to snag one of the constantly-sold-out highlighters, you will know that it looked as good on your face as it did in the package. And of course you can\u2019t beat the budget-friendly price.\n\nWhat viral beauty products have you tried out?

{"label": true, "txt": "One thing you\u2019ll notice when you tune in to the season four premiere of The Flash? There are smiles, jokes, laughter. A lightness has returned, replacing the grim solemnity that nearly swallowed season three whole.\n\nBarry Allen may be trapped in the speed force, but The Flash has returned to form.\n\n\u201cHopefully this season is going to be a little bit more fun,\u201d starDanielle Panabaker told E! News about the new season, premiering Tuesday, Oct. 10. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping to bring back some of the levity we had in season one, that kind of thing.\u201d\n\nWhen we return to Central City, six months have passed since Team Flash defeated the diabolical Savitar, AKA future Barry Allen (Grant Gustin), and Barry was forced to make the hard to decision to leave behind Iris (Candice Patton) and the team in the hopes of calming the speed force, which was in need of a prisoner. In that time, Team Flash\u2014including Wally (Keiynan Lonsdale) and Cisco (Carlos Valdes)\u2014have had to step up and protect the city in the hero\u2019s absence. \u201cIn general, season three was about dealing with Barry Allen\u2019s actions and the repercussions, and this season is going to be more about Team Flash and their actions, and the repercussions to that,\u201d Valdes explained.

{"label": true, "txt": "The wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton took place on 29 April 2011 at Westminster Abbey in London, United Kingdom. The groom, Prince William, is second in the line of succession to the British throne. The bride, Catherine Middleton, had been his girlfriend since 2003.\n\nThe Dean of Westminster, John Hall, presided at the service; the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, conducted the marriage; Richard Chartres, the Bishop of London, preached the sermon; and a reading was given by the bride's brother, James. William's best man was his brother, Prince Harry, while the bride's sister, Pippa, was maid of honour. The ceremony was attended by the bride's and groom's families, as well as members of foreign royal dynasties, diplomats, and the couple's chosen personal guests. After the ceremony, the couple made the traditional appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace. As Prince William was not the heir apparent to the throne, the wedding was not a full state occasion and many details were left to the couple to decide, such as much of the guest list of about 1,900.\n\nPrince William and Kate Middleton met in 2001. Their engagement on 20 October 2010 was announced on 16 November 2010. The build-up to the wedding and the occasion itself attracted much media attention, being compared in many ways with the 1981 marriage of William's parents. The occasion was a public holiday in the United Kingdom and featured many ceremonial aspects, including use of the state carriages and roles for the Foot Guards and Household Cavalry. Events were held around the Commonwealth to mark the wedding; organisations and hotels held events across Canada,[1] over 5,000 street parties were held throughout the United Kingdom, and one million people lined the route between Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace.[2][3] The ceremony was viewed live by tens of millions more around the world, including 72 million live streams on YouTube.[4] In the United Kingdom, television audiences peaked at 26.3 million viewers, with a total of 36.7 million watching part of the coverage.\n\nEngagement announcement [ edit ]\n\nIn 2001, Middleton and Prince William met while studying at the University of St Andrews.[5] They began dating in 2003.[6]\n\nOn 16 November 2010, Clarence House stated that Prince William was to marry Catherine Middleton \"in the Spring or Summer of 2011, in London\".[7] They were engaged in October 2010, while on a private holiday in Kenya; Prince William gave Middleton the same engagement ring that his father had given to William's mother, Diana, Princess of Wales[8]\u2014an 18-karat white gold ring with a 12-carat oval Ceylon (Sri Lankan) sapphire and 14 round diamonds. It was announced at approximately the same time that, after their marriage, the couple would live on the Isle of Anglesey in Wales, where Prince William was based with the Royal Air Force.[7][9]\n\nThe Queen said she was \"absolutely delighted\" for the couple,[8] giving her formal consent to the marriage, as required by the since repealed Royal Marriages Act 1772, in her British privy council on the morning of the engagement.[10] Congratulations also came in from the Queen's prime ministers,[11][12][13] including Prime Minister of Australia Julia Gillard, who has at other times demonstrated moderate republican leanings.[14] The suffragan Bishop of Willesden, Pete Broadbent, who also has republican views, published a critical reaction to the wedding announcement on Facebook. He later acknowledged that his words were \"offensive\" and subsequently apologised,[15] but his superior, Richard Chartres, Bishop of London, instructed him to withdraw from public ministry \"until further notice\".[16][17]\n\nFollowing the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to ITV News political editor Tom Bradby[18] and hosted a photocall at St James's Palace.[19][20] On 12 December 2010, Buckingham Palace issued the official engagement photographs; these were taken on 25 November, in the state apartments at St. James's Palace, by photographer Mario Testino.[21][22]\n\nOn 23 November 2010, the date of the ceremony was confirmed as Friday 29 April 2011.[23][24] The Queen in her British Council ordered on 15 December 2010 that the wedding day would be a public holiday throughout the United Kingdom.[23][25][26] It was also declared an official public holiday in the British Overseas Territories of Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Gibraltar, the Falkland Islands, Montserrat, and the Turks and Caicos, and the British Crown Dependencies of Guernsey, Jersey, and the Isle of Man.[27][28][29] As 29 April fell six days before elections for the Scottish Parliament and the Alternative Vote referendum, this attracted political comment.[30][31][32] John Curtice, a professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, stated for the Scottish elections that the date was \"unfortunate\" and was \"likely to see the Royal Family getting caught up in political debate\".[33]\n\nTV programmes were also shown in the UK prior to the wedding which provided deeper insights into the couple's relationship and backgrounds, including When Kate Met William[34] and Channel 4's Meet the Middletons.[35]\n\nPlanning [ edit ]\n\nNote: All times are in British Summer Time (UTC+01:00)\n\nOn 5 January, St James's Palace publicised that the ceremony would start at 11:00 local time and that the bride would arrive at the abbey by car rather than by carriage (the latter is the traditional transport for royal brides). The route planned was along The Mall, through Horse Guards Parade, and down Whitehall to the abbey. Beforehand, motorists were warned about using the roads in central London on the wedding day, including by Transport for London, which issued travel advice on road closures.[36]\n\nCost [ edit ]\n\nOn the evening of the wedding, the London Eye was lit in the colours of the Union Flag\n\nThe costs of the wedding itself were borne by the Royal Family and the Middletons themselves, while the costs of security and transport were covered by Her Majesty's British treasury.[37][38] The couple also asked that donations be made to charities in place of traditional wedding gifts;[39] to that end, they established The Prince William and Miss Catherine Middleton Charitable Gift Fund, which focuses on assisting charities such as the New Zealand Christchurch earthquake Appeal, the Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary, the Royal Flying Doctor Service, and the Zoological Society of London.[40]\n\nThe overall price of the event was reportedly \u00a323.7 million.[41] The Australian newspaper Herald Sun estimated A$32 million for security and A$800,000 for flowers. Estimates of the cost to the economy of extra public holidays, such as that allowed for the wedding, vary between \u00a31.2 billion and \u00a36 billion.[42] The British government tourist authority VisitBritain predicted the wedding would trigger a tourism boom that would last several years, eventually pulling in an additional 4 million visitors and generating \u00a32 billion.[43] However, VisitBritain's head of research and forecasting, David Edwards, suggested to colleagues two days after the engagement was announced that the evidence points to royal weddings having a negative impact on inbound tourism. He noted that the number of visitors to Britain was down significantly in July 1981, when Prince Charles and Diana were married, from the same period in other years, and also July 1986, when Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson were married, was down from July 1985.[44]\n\nGuest list [ edit ]\n\nOn 16 and 17 February, three sets of guest lists were sent out in the name of the Queen. Many guests (or their successors in office) who were invited to the wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer were not invited to William's wedding. The first list, consisting of about 1,900 people, attended the ceremony in the abbey; the second list of approximately 600 people were invited to the luncheon reception at Buckingham Palace, hosted by the Queen; and the final list, of about 300 names, was for the evening dinner hosted by the Prince of Wales.[45]\n\nMore than half of the guests to attend the wedding itself were family and friends of the couple, though there was a significant number of Commonwealth leaders (including the governors-general who represent the Queen in Commonwealth realms other than the UK, prime ministers of the Commonwealth realms, and heads of government of other Commonwealth countries), members of religious organisations, the diplomatic corps, several military officials, members of the British Royal Household, members of foreign royal families, and representatives of William's charities and others with whom William has worked on official business. Although St James's Palace declined to publish the names of those invited, a breakdown of guests was published by category; the list made no mention of foreign heads of state.[45] The invitation of Se\u00e1n Cardinal Brady, Primate of All Ireland, to the event, and its acceptance, were described as \"unprecedented\" by a spokesman for Ireland's Catholic bishops. The spokesman attributed the invitation to Cardinal Brady\u2019s contribution to the Northern Ireland peace process.[46]\n\nRoute [ edit ]\n\nRoute of the groom to and of the bride and groom from the ceremony at Westminster Abbey\n\nThe route of the groom and his party to the ceremony went between Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey, by The Mall, passing Clarence House, by Horse Guards Road, Horse Guards Parade, through Horse Guards Arch, Whitehall, the south side of Parliament Square, and Broad Sanctuary.[47] After the ceremony, the bridal couple returned along the same route by carriage.[48]\n\nAt 6.00 am, roads in and around the processional route were closed to traffic. From 8.15 am, the main congregation, governors-general, prime ministers of Commonwealth realms, and diplomats all arrived at the abbey. Princes William and Harry, who had stayed at Clarence House,[49] left for the ceremony at 10.10 am in a Bentley State Limousine and arrived at 10.18 am, followed by representatives of foreign royal families, the Middleton family, and, lastly, the Royal Family (the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall; the Princess Royal and Vice Admiral Timothy Laurence; the Duke of York, Princess Beatrice, and Princess Eugenie; and the Earl and Countess of Wessex). The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were the last members of the Royal Family to leave Buckingham Palace, as is tradition, arriving at the abbey for 10.48 am.[50] The bridal party, who had spent the night at the Goring Hotel,[51] left for the ceremony in the former number one state Rolls-Royce Phantom VI at 10.52 am,[52] in time for the service to begin at 11.00 am.\n\nThe service finished at 12.15 pm, after which the newly married couple travelled to Buckingham Palace in a procession consisting of other Royal Family members, the parents of the groom and bride, and the best man and the bridesmaids. At 1.25 pm, the couple appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace to watch a flypast of an Avro Lancaster bomber, a Supermarine Spitfire fighter, and a Hawker Hurricane fighter aircraft from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, followed by two Typhoons from RAF Coningsby and two Tornado GR4s from RAF Leuchars in a flat diamond formation.[53][54]\n\nCeremony [ edit ]\n\nVenue [ edit ]\n\nWestminster Abbey has been the venue for coronations and some royal weddings\n\nWestminster Abbey, founded in AD 960, has a particular status and is known as a Royal Peculiar.[55] Although the abbey has been the traditional location for coronations since 1066, not until the 20th century did it become the church of choice for royal weddings; prior to 1918, most royal weddings took place in the royal chapels, such as the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace and St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.[56] The abbey, which has a usual seating capacity of 2000,[57] has been the venue for most royal weddings in the last century, including those of William's grandparents (the present Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip) in 1947, William's great-aunt Princess Margaret in 1960, William's first cousin twice removed Princess Alexandra in 1963, William's aunt Princess Anne in 1973, and William's uncle Prince Andrew in 1986.[58] A prominent decorative addition inside the abbey for the ceremony was an avenue of 20-foot tall trees, six field maple and two hornbeams, arranged on either side of the main aisle.[59]\n\nBridal party [ edit ]\n\nIn a break with royal tradition, the groom had a best man\u2014his brother, Prince Harry\u2014rather than a supporter, while the bride chose her sister, Pippa, as maid of honour. There were four bridesmaids and two page boys:[60][61] Lady Louise Windsor, the seven-year-old daughter of the Earl and Countess of Wessex; Margarita Armstrong-Jones, the eight-year-old daughter of Viscount and Viscountess Linley; Grace van Cutsem, the three-year-old daughter of the couple's friend, Hugh van Cutsem; Eliza Lopes, the three-year-old granddaughter of the Duchess of Cornwall; William Lowther-Pinkerton, the ten-year-old son of William's private secretary, Major Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton; and Tom Pettifer, the eight-year-old son of Princes William and Harry's former nanny, \"Tiggy\" Pettifer.\n\nWedding attire [ edit ]\n\nBride [ edit ]\n\nDuchess of Cambridge in bridal gown\n\nThe bridal dress, designed by the London-based designer Sarah Burton at Alexander McQueen,[62] was made of satin and featured an overlaid lace bodice and appliqued skirt. The lace bodice incorporated machine-made lace, sourced from manufacturers in France and Britain. Floral motifs were cut from lengths of these and then appliqu\u00e9d by hand onto silk net (tulle) by workers from the Royal School of Needlework. The ivory gown of white satin gazar with overall lace applique work with floral detail, the full skirt with box pleats, the back leading to a 9ft train. The lace bodice with V-neck line and long sleeves. The lace detail incorporating the rose, thistle, daffodil and shamrock[63]. The dress had a series of lace motifs including a rose, thistle, daffodil and shamrock to represent England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.[64] The veil was held in place by a Cartier Scroll Tiara, made in 1936 and lent to her by the Queen. It was purchased by the Queen's father, the future King George VI, for his wife Elizabeth three weeks before his accession. Princess Elizabeth (now Queen Elizabeth II) received the tiara from her mother on her 18th birthday. In order to avoid her tiara falling off, as had happened for Lady Diana Spencer while wearing a Spencer family tiara during her 1981 wedding to the Prince of Wales, Catherine's stylists \"backcombed the top [of her hair] to create a foundation for the tiara to sit around, then did a tiny plait in the middle and sewed it on.\"[65]\n\nFor the customary bridal themes of \"Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue\", Middleton's gown had lace appointments (the \"old\"), diamond earrings given by her parents (the \"new\"), the Queen's tiara (the \"borrowed\"), and a blue ribbon sewn into the bodice (the \"blue\").[66] The shoes were also from Alexander McQueen[67] and had a lace pattern matching the dress with appliques made by the Royal School of Needlework.[68]\n\nThe bride's shield-shaped wired bouquet, designed by Derek Connolly, contained myrtle, Lily of the Valley, Sweet William and hyacinth.[66]\n\nMiddleton's hair was styled in loose curls for the occasion by hair dresser James Pryce of the Richard Ward Salon.[65][69] She received private make-up lessons from Arabella Preston[69][70] and the entire bridal party received \"makeup artistry assistance\" from Bobbi Brown make-up artist Hannah Martin prior to the event, but ultimately Middleton did her own makeup for the occasion.[71] The look was described as a \"soft smokey eye\" with pink lips and cheeks.[69][72] Her nails were painted by manicurist Marina Sandoval in a mixture of two polishes: a \"barely there pink\" and a \"sheer beige\" to complement her skin tone and gown.[73]\n\nBridal attendants [ edit ]\n\nMaid-of-honour Pippa Middleton also wore a gown by Sarah Burton of Alexander McQueen. It has been described as being made of \"heavy, ivory satin-based crepe, with a cowl front and with the same button detail and lace trims as the Bride\u2019s dress.\"[74][75] Like her sister, she received \"makeup artistry assistance\" from Bobbi Brown make-up artist Hannah Martin, but it is unclear who actually put on her makeup for the wedding day.[71] Her hair was loosely curled in a half-up, half-down style by the Richard Ward Salon[65] with a deep side part and a hairpiece made of ivy and lily of the valley to match Catherine's bouquet.[69]\n\nThe young bridesmaids wore dresses designed by Nicki Macfarlane, handmade with the help of Macfarlane's daughter Charlotte, in their homes at Wiltshire and Kent.[74][76] The gowns echoed the bride's dress and were made with the same fabrics and button detail along the back.[74][76] They were described as having a \"ballerina-length, full, box pleated skirt\" and were hand finished with English Cluny lace.[74][77] Their ivy and lily-of-the-valley hair wreaths were influenced by Catherine's mother Carole's headdress at her 1981 wedding to Michael Middleton.[74][76]\n\nAll of the bridesmaids wore satin Mary Jane style shoes with a Swarovski crystal buckle designed by Devon-based Rainbow Club.[74][77] Their flowers were designed and made by Shane Connolly and replicated the flowers in Catherine's bouquet: lily-of-the-valley, sweet William, and hyacinth.[74][77]\n\nThe pageboys' outfits were designed by Kashket and Partners[78] in the style worn by a \"Foot Guard officer at the time of the Regency (the 1820s)\" with an insignia from the Irish Guards, whose Colonel is Prince William.[74] The tunics are red with gold piping and have Irish shamrocks on the collars. The Pages wore a gold and crimson sash (with tassel) around their waists, as is tradition for officers in the Irish Guards when in the presence of a member of the Royal Family.[74]\n\nGroom and best man [ edit ]\n\nPrince William in uniform\n\nPrince William wore an Irish Guards mounted officer's uniform in Guard of Honour Order with a forage cap, rather than the bearskin hat.[79][80] As a serving Royal Air Force flight lieutenant who also held the equivalent Royal Navy rank of lieutenant and army rank of captain in the Blues and Royals, William could have chosen to wear the uniform of any of these junior officer ranks. However, as he had been appointed colonel of the Irish Guards on 10 February 2011, he opted instead to wear the full dress uniform of that regiment.[81] As a Knight of the Order of the Garter, he wore the order's star and blue riband, to which were affixed his RAF wings and Golden Jubilee Medal.[82] William did not wear a sword in the church.[82]\n\nPrince Harry wore the uniform of a captain of the Blues and Royals (Royal Horse Guards and 1st Dragoons), with a forage cap. He wore aiguillettes, a cross-belt and gold waist belt with sword slings, but no sword. He wore the wings of the Army Air Corps and Golden Jubilee and Afghanistan Campaign medals.[82]\n\nDesigner Russell Kashket worked with the Princes to address concerns they had with the outfits. One such concern was the heat of the Abbey, so the designers used special material to absorb the heat while still achieving the desired look. Further, military dress uniforms do not traditionally have pockets, but the palace requested that some sort of compartment be added to Harry's outfit so that Catherine's wedding ring would not be lost.[78][83]\n\nWedding service [ edit ]\n\nThe order of service chosen by the bridal couple was the Series One form which is virtually identical with that of the 1928 Prayer Book.[84] The Dean of Westminster, John Hall, officiated for most of the service, with Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, as celebrant of the marriage and Richard Chartres, the Bishop of London, preaching the sermon.[85] It has long been traditional for the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Church of England's most senior bishop, to officiate at the weddings of England's monarchs and future monarchs.[86] Chartres is a close friend of the Prince of Wales and confirmed both Prince William and Kate Middleton.[87]\n\nThe service commenced with the procession of the Queen, Prince Philip and the clergy. Shortly after, Middleton arrived with the party of maid of honour and junior attendants. As the choir sang \"I was glad\", an anthem by Sir Hubert Parry composed in 1902 for the coronation of King Edward VI, the bride made her three-and-a-half-minute procession through the nave and choir on her father's arm, to meet Prince William.[88] The service proceeded with the formal service and congregational singing of three well known hymns, fanfares, anthems, organ and orchestral music.\n\nIn the marriage vows, the couple promised to \"love, comfort, honour and keep\" each other. This was sealed by the exchange of a single ring.[89]\n\nThe lesson, read by the bride's brother, James Middleton, was from the Epistle to the Romans (Chapter 12, verses 1\u20132 and 9\u201318) and is an exhortation to live a righteous and peaceful life.[90]\n\nThe sermon, preached by the Bishop of London, commenced with a quotation from Catherine of Siena whose feast day it was. The bishop urged the couple to live selflessly, each remembering the needs of each other and seeking to transform each other by love rather than seeking to reform. He ended the sermon with a prayer composed by the couple themselves:[85][91][92]\n\nGod our Father, we thank you for our families; for the love that we share and for the joy of our marriage. In the busyness of each day keep our eyes fixed on what is real and important in life and help us to be generous with our time and love and energy. Strengthened by our union help us to serve and comfort those who suffer. We ask this in the Spirit of Jesus Christ. Amen.\n\nThe service continued with prayers and exhortations by the dean and archbishop. A newly composed choral anthem was sung by the choir. After the signing of the registers, William and Catherine walked down the aisle, pausing briefly to bow and curtsey to the Queen. They were followed in procession by other members of the bridal party, and their families, being joined at the door by the two youngest flower girls.[53]\n\nOn leaving Westminster Abbey, to the pealing of bells, they passed through a guard of honour of individually selected men and women from the various services, and were greeted by cheers from the crowds. The bridal couple entered the 1902 State Landau drawn by four white horses with postilions and attendant footmen, and guarded by a mounted escort of the Life Guard. A similar open carriage carried the rest of the bridal party, escorted by the Blues and Royals. The Queen and other members of the Royal Family followed in coaches drawn by the Queen's Cleveland Bay horses, and in state cars.[53]\n\nMusic [ edit ]\n\nThe couple return from the abbey to the Palace in the 1902 State Landau\n\nTwo choirs, one orchestra and a fanfare ensemble played the music for the service. These were the Westminster Abbey Choir, the Chapel Royal Choir, the London Chamber Orchestra and a fanfare ensemble from the Central Band of the Royal Air Force.[93] The choirs were directed by James O\u2019Donnell, organist and Master of the Choristers at Westminster Abbey. The abbey\u2019s sub-organist, Robert Quinney, played the organ. The organist, choir master and composer at the Chapel Royal is Andrew Gant. The London Chamber Orchestra was conducted by Christopher Warren-Green, who is its music director and principal conductor. The fanfares were performed under the direction of Wing Commander Duncan Stubbs.[94]\n\nThe bride processed down the aisle to the anthem \"I Was Glad\", written by Sir Charles Hubert Hastings Parry, from Psalm 122. It was composed for the crowning of Prince William's great-great-great grandfather, Edward VII, at Westminster Abbey in 1902.[95]\n\nThree congregational hymns were sung during the service. The first was \"Guide me, O Thou Great Redeemer\" sung to the tune \"Cwm Rhondda\". The hymn, originally written in Welsh by 18th-century Methodist preacher William Williams, had been sung at the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales.[96] The words to their second hymn, \"Love Divine, All Loves Excelling\", were by Charles Wesley and its tune \u2013 Blaenwern \u2013 was composed by William Penfro Rowlands, during the 1904\u20131905 Welsh Revival. This hymn was sung at the Prince of Wales's 2005 marriage to the Duchess of Cornwall.[96] The third hymn was \"Jerusalem\", based on the poem by William Blake and set to music by Sir Charles Hubert Hastings Parry.[96]\n\nChoral compositions featured in the service were Parry's Blest Pair of Sirens (a setting of an ode by John Milton) during the signing of the register, Paul Mealor's Ubi Caritas et Amor as the motet and a specially commissioned anthem, \"This is the day which the Lord hath made\" consisting of words chosen from the Psalms, by John Rutter.[97][98]\n\nFanfare ensemble leader Wing Commander Duncan Stubbs's own composition, Valiant and Brave, was performed as the royal couple signed the wedding registers.[93] Preux et audacieux (which translates from French as \"Valiant and Brave\") is the motto of 22 Squadron, in which Prince William was serving as a search and rescue pilot at RAF Valley in North Wales.[99] The fanfare led into the recessional music, the orchestral march \"Crown Imperial\" by William Walton, composed for the coronation of George VI and which was also performed at Charles and Diana's wedding.[100]\n\nThe music performed before the service included two instrumental pieces by Sir Peter Maxwell Davies (\"Veni Creator Spiritus\" and \"Farewell to Stromness\") as well as with works by J.S. Bach, Benjamin Britten, Frederick Delius, Edward Elgar, Gerald Finzi, Charles Villiers Stanford, Ralph Vaughan Williams and Percy Whitlock.[97]\n\nThe bells of Westminster Abbey rang a full peal as the newly married couple and guests left the church. The ten bells rang a peal called \"Spliced Surprise Royal\", consisting of 5,040 changes, that took more than three hours to complete. They were rung by the volunteers of the Westminster Abbey Company of Ringers, under the direction of David Hilling.[101]\n\nWedding ring [ edit ]\n\nThe wedding ring of Catherine is made from Welsh gold.[102][103] The ring was created by the royal warrant holder Wartski, a company with roots in Bangor, Gwynedd, north Wales.[104] Since 1923, it has been a tradition in the Royal Family to use Welsh gold for the wedding ring of the bride.[105] This ring was made from a small amount of gold that had been kept in the royal vaults since it was presented to Queen Elizabeth II. It was mined from the Clogau Gold Mine in the mountains of North Wales. The Clogau Gold Mine had its heyday in the late nineteenth century, was abandoned in the early twentieth century, was reopened in 1992 and finally closed in 1998.[106] The Queen had \"given a piece of the gold that has been in the family for many years to Prince William as a gift,\" a palace source stated.[105] Prince William chose not to receive a wedding ring at the ceremony.[103]\n\nTitle upon marriage [ edit ]\n\nOn the morning of the wedding, it was announced that William was to be created Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Strathearn, and Baron Carrickfergus,[107] with Catherine becoming Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge after the wedding.[108] This is in line with the practice of granting titles upon marriage to royal princes who did not already have one (for example, Prince Andrew was created Duke of York when he married in 1986).[109] Strathearn is close to St Andrews, Fife, in Scotland, where the couple met as students, and Carrickfergus is in Northern Ireland. Combined with his existing titular link with Wales, William's collective titles link him to each of the four countries in the United Kingdom.[108][111]\n\nFamily celebrations [ edit ]\n\nThe Queen hosted a lunchtime reception at Buckingham Palace,[85][112] starting after the arrival of the married couple's carriage. It was a private gathering for guests drawn from the congregation who represent the couple's official and private lives. During the reception, at which the Official Harpist to the Prince of Wales, Claire Jones, performed,[94] the couple made an appearance on the balcony on the east (main) front of Buckingham Palace, where they shared a kiss.[113] Jones played a gold leaf harp known as \"Prince of Wales\" presented to Prince Charles in 2006 by Italian-American harp maker Salvi Harps.[114]\n\nAt 3.35 pm, William drove his new wife back up the Mall for the short distance to Clarence House, his then official London residence. The car, a blue, two seat Aston Martin DB6 Volante (MkII convertible) that had been given to Prince Charles by the Queen as a 21st birthday present, was decorated in the customary newlywed style by the best man and friends; the rear number plate read \"JU5T WED\".[115][116] The Prince had changed into a Blues and Royals captain's frock coat also made by Kashket;[117] his wife was still wearing her wedding dress. In a surprise organised by RAF Wattisham, the car was shadowed by a yellow Sea King helicopter flying the RAF Ensign from its winch cable, marking William's service as a pilot with the RAF Search and Rescue Force.[118]\n\nIn the evening, the Prince of Wales gave a private dinner, followed by dancing, at Buckingham Palace for the couple and their close friends and family.[47][119] For the evening reception, the Duchess of Cambridge wore a strapless dress by Sarah Burton which \"featured a circle skirt and diamante detailing\".[120] She also wore a white shrug and let her hair down.[121] The singer-songwriter Ellie Goulding performed at the event, singing her rendition of \"Your Song\" for the couple's first dance. The singer also performed her hit single \"Starry Eyed\" for the assembled guests. The event ended at 3 am, with a small fireworks display in the palace grounds.[122]\n\nThe wedding cake had a strong British floral theme, using elements of the Joseph Lambeth technique. It was an eight-tiered traditional fruit cake decorated with sugar paste flowers. The cake designer Fiona Cairns based in Fleckney, Leicestershire was chosen in February 2011 to create the wedding cake. Additionally, McVitie's created a groom's cake from chocolate biscuit for the reception at Buckingham Palace. The chocolate biscuit cake was made from a Royal Family recipe and was specially requested by Prince William.[47][123]\n\nThe wedding bouquet was returned to Westminster Abbey and placed on the Tomb of The Unknown Warrior by a royal official, after the photographs had been taken. This followed the tradition started by Prince William's great grandmother, Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, after her marriage to the Duke of York in 1923.[124][125] The formal portraits were taken by Hugo Burnand at Buckingham Palace following the ceremony.[126]\n\nPublic celebration [ edit ]\n\nOfficial merchandise, coins, and stamps [ edit ]\n\nPrince William and Catherine Middleton personally approved an official range of china (including handmade plates, cups, and pill boxes) to be made for the Royal Collection and sold as souvenirs from December 2010 on.[127] The items are decorated with the intertwined initials of the couple under the prince's coronet and include the wording \"To celebrate the marriage of Prince William of Wales and Catherine Middleton 29 April 2011.\"[128] The Lord Chamberlain's office approved a longer list of memorabilia, including official mugs, plates, biscuit tins, and porcelain pill pots. The document also clarified the use of William's coat of arms and pictures of the couple on such items. Initially, the Palace refused to sanction official tea towels, which, along with aprons, T-shirts and cushions, were deemed, \"in poor taste\".[129] However, the restriction on tea towels, though not the other items, was later reversed. Sales of merchandising were expected to reach \u00a344 million.[128]\n\nTo mark the engagement of William and Catherine, the Royal Mint produced an official Alderney \u00a35 engagement coin, showing the couple in profile,[130] as well as an official UK \u00a35 coin for the wedding.[131] The Royal Australian Mint issued a series of circulation and collectable coins designed by Stuart Devlin.[132] The Royal Canadian Mint released a series of coins and Canada Post issued a stamp,[133] approved by Clarence House, in commemoration of the wedding.[134] On 21 April, a set of commemorative postage stamps, featuring the couple's official engagement photographs, was issued by Royal Mail.[135]\n\nBroadcasting [ edit ]\n\nThe wedding was widely broadcast on television, internet, and radio, in more than 180 countries.[136] ITV,[137] BBC,[138] and CNN covered the ceremony and associated events live through the combined pool of footage from the BBC, Sky, and ITN to help cover the overall cost.[139] In North America, which is five to nine hours behind British Summer Time, the wedding occurred during the time usually taken up by network breakfast television programmes, which expanded their normal length to allow for full coverage. NBC's Today began coverage at 4 am Eastern Time, and along with MSNBC, partnered with ITV.[140][141] ABC partnered with BBC,[142] CBS has its own live London affiliates,[143] and Fox and Fox News Channel partnered with their sister network Sky News.[144] The CBC[145] and CTV had live coverage.[146] Cable networks and radio also had live coverage.[147] In Mexico, the wedding aired on Televisa and TV Azteca; all television stations in Mexico carrying the ceremony stayed on the air during the late night hours instead of normally signing off. The ABC also took the BBC feed in Australia, in addition with pay TV channel UKTV. Coverage was also provided on the Seven Network, Nine Network and Network Ten. The ABC had planned to produce alternative commentary with The Chaser, but in response to these plans, the BBC barred the use of its footage for such a purpose, on orders from Clarence House.[148] The royal wedding was also streamed live online on YouTube via the British Monarchy's official The Royal Channel.[149]\n\nAn April 2011 poll of 2,000 British adults found that 35% of the public intended to watch the wedding on television while an equal proportion planned to ignore the event altogether.[150] According to their reported plans, women were more than twice as likely (47%) to watch the event as men (23%).[151] Early estimates following the ceremony indicated an estimated 24.5 million people in the United Kingdom watched the wedding on either BBC One or ITV, giving those channels a 99.4% share of the terrestrial television audience as the service began,[152] with the BBC's Live royal wedding website having 9 million hits, estimating over half the British population watched the wedding.\n\nThe viewing figures for the event have been the subject of much speculation, with Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt estimating that 2 billion people would watch the wedding.[153] Following the event, this figure was duly reported by the media,[154][155] but was criticised by some news outlets for being inaccurate and unfounded.[156][157] Estimated figures include a peak audience of 26.3 million viewers and a total of 36.7 million watching at least some part of the wedding coverage in the UK,[158] while in the United States, the wedding drew an average audience of 22.8 million, with over 60 million tuning in at some point to watch some of the coverage.[159] In India, a reported 42.1 million viewers tuned in,[160] 9.9 million viewers in Germany,[161] 9.6 million viewers in France,[161] 5.22 million viewers watched the event in Canada with twelve million tuning in at some point,[162] five million in Australia,[163] and one million was expected in China,[164] for an audience of 122 million to 176 million viewers, drawing from a total population pool of 3.126 billion (approximately 45% of the world's population). Other reported figures put the global audience at 162 million viewers.[165] In addition to the television audiences, the ceremony attracted 72 million live streams and a reach of 101 million streams on YouTube across 188 countries.[166] With its 72 million streams, the wedding has been listed in the 2012 Guinness Book of World Records for the record of \"Most Live Streams for a Single Event\", beating out the Michael Jackson memorial service in 2009.[167] It has been suggested that the \"two billion\" figure is exaggerated,[168] and that there are too many gaps in the worldwide TV measuring system to accurately audit global audience figures.[169]\n\nInfluence on power demand [ edit ]\n\nIn the UK, the National Grid reported a huge surge in demand for power after the service, equivalent to one million kettles being boiled, when the royal couple returned to Buckingham Palace.[170] Viewership of the wedding was recorded by electricity use in Ontario, where, at the approximate moment Middleton arrived at Westminster Abbey, the Independent Electricity System Operator recorded a 300 megawatt drop in electricity use, which was attributed to \"people going about their normal morning routines [stopping] whatever they were doing, rather than make breakfast or shower, and watch the TV\".[171]\n\nPublic response [ edit ]\n\nThere were about 5,500 applications to hold royal wedding street parties across England and Wales, including 850 in London, one of which was hosted by Prime Minister David Cameron in Downing Street for charity workers and local children.[172] The anti-monarchy campaign group Republic held an alternative street party in Holborn.[173] The event had initially been blocked by Camden Council after businesses raised concerns about loss of trade.[174]\n\nA number of ceremonies and parties were held at places which had an intimate connection with the couple. In Scotland, about 2,000 people attended a party at the University of St Andrews, where the royal couple first met. Hundreds of people watched the ceremony on a big screen in Edinburgh's Festival Square.[175] Welsh celebrations were led by Anglesey, where Prince William is a search and rescue pilot and where the couple will reside after the wedding. 2,600 people gathered to watch the event on big screens there, and around 200 street parties were organised throughout the rest of the country, including over 50 in Cardiff.[176]\n\nThe international Peace Bridge across the Niagara River between the United States and Canada at Buffalo, New York, and Fort Erie, Ontario, and operated in part by an Ontario Crown corporation, was lit in red, blue and gold, the colours of the royal crest.[177]\n\nCriticism and scepticism stemmed from the belief that, at a time of recession and rising unemployment in the UK, millions of pounds in tax funds were used for the wedding's security. The costs of the wedding itself were paid for by the Royal Family and the Middletons.[178][179][180] Emma Boon, campaign director for the taxpayers union TaxPayers' Alliance, expressed distaste for the lavish cost of the wedding and noted, \"Of course it should be an event for the whole nation to celebrate, but ordinary taxpayers should not be left with a bill fit for a king.\" Graham Smith, current Campaign Manager of Republic, also spoke out on the taxpayer's responsibility to the wedding.[181]\n\nCharitable fund [ edit ]\n\nIn March 2011, William and Catherine set up a gift fund held by The Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry to allow well-wishers who wanted to give them a wedding gift to donate money to charities with which they were involved, incorporating the armed forces, children, the elderly, art, sport and conservation..[182][183]\n\nThe fund supported a total of 26 named organisations:\n\nTributes outside the Commonwealth [ edit ]\n\nIn the United States, the Empire State Building in New York City was lit in red, white, and blue, the colours of the Union Flag at sunset on 29 April to mark the wedding.[212]\n\nPolicing [ edit ]\n\nThe wedding had been subject to threats of violence and disruption. In February, security agencies, including MI5, identified \"dissident Irish republican groups\" as possible threats.[213] The group Muslims Against Crusades abandoned a planned protest.[214] The English Defence League vowed to hold a counter-demonstration and promised 50 to 100 EDL members at each railway station in central London to block Muslim extremists in a \"ring of steel\".[215]\n\nSecurity operations and arrests [ edit ]\n\nSixty people arrested at the TUC rally on the March for the Alternative had bail conditions that prevented them entering central London over the wedding period.[216]\n\nOn 28 April 2011, political activist Chris Knight and two others were arrested by Scotland Yard \"on suspicion of conspiracy to cause public nuisance and breach of the peace\". The three were planning a mock execution of Prince Andrew with a home-made guillotine in central London to coincide with the wedding. The guillotine was workable, but lacked a blade.[217][218]\n\nOn the day of the wedding, the Metropolitan Police Service made \"pre-emptive\" moves, applying blanket stop-and-search powers and arresting 52 people, including 13 arrested at Charing Cross station in possession of anti-monarchy placards and \"climbing equipment\".[219] Five people, three of whom wearing zombie make-up, were arrested \"on suspicion of planning a breach of the peace\" when they entered a branch of Starbucks. At a peaceful protest in Soho Square, a man was arrested by plain clothes police. Chief Inspector John Dale claimed \"He had articles on him to cause criminal damage\".[219][220] Police described the overall security operation as an \"amazing success\".[221][222]\n\nIn Scotland, twenty-one people were arrested at an unofficial \"street party\" in Kelvingrove Park, Glasgow which saw \"completely unacceptable levels\" of drunkenness, according to Strathclyde Police.[223] A taxi driver died on 10 May from injuries sustained when his cab was struck by a police van attending the Kelvingrove incident.[224]\n\nHoneymoon [ edit ]\n\nDespite reports that the couple would leave for their honeymoon the day after their wedding,[225][226] Prince William immediately returned to his work as a search-and-rescue pilot, and the couple did not depart until 9 May, ten days after their wedding.[227] The location of the honeymoon was initially kept secret. Although the press speculated that they might be headed to locations such as South America, Jordan, and Kenya,[225] the couple ultimately decided to honeymoon for 10 days on a secluded villa on a private island in the Seychelles.[227] On the morning of 21 May, a spokesman for St. James's Palace announced that the couple had returned to the United Kingdom.[228][229] The length of the honeymoon was limited by William's RAF duties and the couple's official scheduled tour to Canada and the United States.[227][230]"}

{"label": true, "txt": "The previously announced fifth season will return in early 2019 as its stars have already put three projects in development at Comedy Central under their new first-look deal.\n\nThe end of Broad City is in sight.\n\nThe previously announced fifth season of the Comedy Central critical favorite \u2014 set to air in early 2019, more than a year after its fourth cycle ended \u2014 will be its last. Meanwhile, stars Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson have signed a first-look television deal with Comedy Central parent company Viacom, with three projects already in development for their soon-to-be former network. The first-look pact covers Glazer and Jacobson together as well as individually.\n\n\"Broad City has been our baby and first love for almost 10 years, since we started as a web series. It's been a phenomenal experience, and we've put ourselves into it completely. Broad City's always had a spontaneous pace and feeling, and ending after season five honors that spirit. We are very excited to bring new voices and points of view to Comedy Central and continue our collaboration together in new ways,\" Glazer and Jacobson said Thursday in a joint statement.\n\nWhile none of the three comedies in development are written by or starring either Glazer or Jacobson, Comedy Central president Kent Alterman tells The Hollywood Reporter he's \"taking it as it comes\" from the in-demand duo, who now both have film careers and are juggling other projects.\n\nIn development at the cable network are:\n\n\u2022 Mall Town USA, an animated comedy about a 13-year-old girl navigating puberty and society in American culture at the mall. The project is written and created by Gabe Liedman (Broad City), with Jacobson and Glazer executive producing.\n\n\u2022 Platinum Status, a live-action comedy written by Ilana Glazer's brother, Eliot Glazer. He stars as a gay man who hooks up with a woman after his boyfriend of 10 years dumps him. Eliot Glazer will write the script and exec produce alongside Ilana Glazer, Principato Young's Peter Principato and Brian Steinberg and Electric Avenue's Will Arnett and Marc Forman.\n\n\u2022 Young Professionals hails from David Litt, who at 24 became one of the youngest White House speechwriters in history. The comedy is inspired by Litt's coming of age in the nation's capital and follows five housemates growing up \u2014 personally, politically and professionally \u2014 in Washington. Litt will pen the script and exec produce alongside Jacobson and Glazer.\n\nIn a larger sense, UTA-repped Glazer and Jacobson's deal will allow them to develop projects across Viacom's television portfolio. Unlike similar Viacom pacts with Trevor Noah and Tyler Perry, it is not exclusive and does not include film. Still, the deal sends a message to the town that Comedy Central is willing to do its part to keep homegrown talent as more of its stars have moved on elsewhere.\n\nBelow, Alterman talks with The Hollywood Reporter about the decision to end the award-winning show, what to expect from the deal and the future of another tentpole series, Inside Amy Schumer.\n\nWhy end Broad City now?\n\nIt's more of a creative thing than anything. It's a show about two twenty-somethings in New York, and Abbi and Ilana are smart about not wanting to overstretch it beyond plausibility. They're telling a particular story about the post-college era in New York. It's an organic conclusion to the journey that they've been on.\n\nWhose decision was it?\n\nUltimately it was their decision \u2014 where they want to resolve the characters' stories. We'd never want them to overstay their welcome. It was really driven by creative storytelling and when is a natural life [of the show over]? We're thrilled with five seasons of a show like this. The last thing we'd want is them to pretend they're younger than they are and contrive and force it. The thing that matters to us more than anything is the creative integrity of the storytelling.\n\nThe final season isn't returning until 2019, at which point it will have been off for more than a year. What's behind the delay?\n\nThere's no real delay. We've had other breaks with Broad City as well. One thing we did last year that was effective was we had a writing period and then they went off and did other things and came back to have a mini punch-up writing season that really helped. They'll be doing the same thing this time. It's about how it lines up with their schedules and not wanting to shoot in the winter. It's just the way it naturally unfolded.\n\nYou're signing Glazer and Jacobson to a larger first-look deal across all of Viacom in pacts similar to those with Tyler Perry and Trevor Noah.\n\nThis is more of a traditional first-look deal, and we already have three projects in development as part of it.\n\nNone of the three shows they're developing for Comedy Central are either written by or star the duo. Is the expectation that they'll return to TV and topline a show of their own again at some point?\n\nI don't want to speak for them. They're unwinding a 10-year intense, deep dive into this show and these characters [counting the web series]. The first stuff coming at us is stuff that they're bringing from people they've collaborated with and new ideas. We're taking it as it comes. We haven't even discussed that. But if they had something they wanted to do on-camera, we wouldn't refuse it. But it has to come organically.\n\nYou're leveraging the entire Viacom portfolio here. What kind of conversations have you or CEO Bob Bakish had with Glazer and Jacobson to do something broader for other Viacom networks?\n\nI haven't had that conversation with Bob. I don't want to put the cart before the horse. To me, it's like, what are the things that they naturally gravitate toward? When do they make sense for us or other Viacom brands? That's how we'll move forward.\n\nAs Netflix continues to poach prolific producers and talent, what's the sell to Glazer and Jacobson to stay within the Viacom fold?\n\nWe've had a great collaboration with them and everyone is excited to continue.\n\nAs they came to you to end the show, what was the larger Viacom pitch to get them to stay? Ryan Murphy loved his time at 20th Century Fox but still signed with Netflix.\n\nIt was more of an organic, mutual conversation. There were no ulterior motives or coercion or anything like that. Like I said, we've had this great collaboration and everyone has been motivated to continue it and find whatever ways that make sense for stuff to come down the pike. We're excited for more from them.\n\nAbbi Jacobson is co-writing and exec producing Amazon's A League of Their Own. Both have busy film careers. What level of exclusivity will you have here?\n\nIt's not exclusive. It's first-look.\n\nDoes that include film?\n\nThere is no specific film component. But if they come to us with ideas that make sense, we'll do it.\n\nHow much of this deal is a message to the town that you're going to fight and try to keep more of your homegrown talent after, most recently, losing The Daily Show's Hasan Minhaj and Michelle Wolf to Netflix?\n\nWe're definitely interested in continuing good, creative collaborations with the people that we're in business with. We're still bummed that Jon Stewart only gave us 16-plus years. But everyone has their path and we wish Hasan and Michelle well and continued success. With Hasan, we are continuing [our relationship] with him: We're doing a special with his sketch group and hopefully we'll have ongoing collaboration with him. Ultimately, we want to continue with people where it makes sense.\n\nHave you had any talks with Glazer and Jacobson about doing any sort of Broad City spinoff or movie to see where they are as they get into their 30s?\n\nWe're really driven by the creative integrity of the storytelling. The last thing we'd do is start to contrive something for them. We'll take it as it comes.\n\nAs you look to the end of one of your tentpole shows, what's the latest on the previously announced fifth season of Inside Amy Schumer?\n\nWe're in the same situation we've always been in: We're here if and when she wants to use that format for more storytelling."}

It displays a celebrated quote from one of her speeches, \u201cI am proud to be a woman and a feminist,\u201d as well as detailing her humanitarian achievements and plans to assist the Queen in royal duties in the United Kingdom and overseas.\n\nIt describes her work with the Myna Mahila Foundation, which empowers women in Mumbai through access to menstrual hygiene products and employment opportunities. Instead of wedding gifts, the couple requested donations to charities including this one.\n\nThe Suits star previously said she intends to \u201chit the ground running\u201d, with the honeymoon on hold until she and Harry have made some early appearances as husband and wife.\n\nThe couple today left the Queen and Prince Phillip at Windsor Castle, where they stayed the night, and headed home to their official residence at Nottingham Cottage, in the grounds of Kensington Palace.\n\nOn Tuesday, the royal couple will attend Prince Charles\u2019s 70th Birthday Patronage Celebration, which recognises his charitable and military affiliations. The party for 6000 people ahead of Prince Charles\u2019s birthday in November will take place on the Buckingham Palace lawn.\n\nMeghan is due to join the Queen at the Chelsea Flower Show this week, before the newest member of the royal family and her husband make a short trip to Ireland. Harry, 33, has never been to the Republic before, while his wife visited as an ambassador for the One Young World summit in 2014.\n\nPrince William and Kate have also never visited Ireland in an official capacity.\n\nHarry and Meghan\u2019s next official tour comes in October, when they will visit Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga, when the Invictus Games is held in Sydney.\n\nThe pair made their first public appearance together at the Invictus Games \u2014 Harry\u2019s event in honour of war heroes \u2014 in Toronto, Canada, in 2017.\n\nThey have made it clear the Commonwealth will be a priority, with flowers from all 53 countries hand-stitched into Meghan\u2019s lace veil. The Queen also appointed her grandson a Commonwealth youth ambassador as a wedding gift, his most high profile role to date.\n\nWith all this going on, they will also fit in a romantic honeymoon to a far-flung destination, with Africa considered the most likely choice.\n\nHarry is a huge fan of Botswana, where he took Meghan on an early date, and Namibia is reportedly their favoured destination, with its spectacular scenery and private luxury lodges making it the perfect place for a getaway.\n\nOther possible locations for their break include Jamaica, where the couple attended Harry\u2019s friend Tom \u2018Skippy\u2019 Inskip\u2019s wedding; Norway, where the lovebirds took their first holiday; Italy\u2019s Amalfi Coast, where Meghan has spent time with friends; or Nevis in the Caribbean, which Harry first visited with his mother in 1993, returning in 2016 for a royal tour.\n\nAfter the stress of organising the most anticipated wedding of a generation \u2014 as well as recent drama with Meghan\u2019s family \u2014 they will be looking forward to getting away from it all.\n\nThe excitement and fanfare we have witnessed is just the first step in what will be a closely scrutinised relationship, with high hopes for what the unusual royal couple can achieve.\n\nMeghan \u2014 a mixed race, American actress \u2014 has vowed to use her new role to improve the world, and Harry is also invested in charity work, following the example of his beloved late mother.\n\nThe Californian divorcee is the first woman to bear the title of Her Royal Highness, the Duchess of Sussex. The one former Duke of Sussex was married twice, but his father George III did not approve either marriage, so they were considered unlawful.\n\nThe Prince will also take on the titles Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel.\n\nThe couple are also expected to try for children soon, and are eventually likely to leave \u201cNotts Cotts\u201d for a 21-room Kensington Palace apartment, next to the one William and Kate moved into when they left the smaller property.\n\nPrincess Eugenie and fiance Jack Brooksbank now live in Ivy Cottage in the palace grounds, and Harry and Meghan will probably attend their wedding, which is also at St George\u2019s Chapel in Windsor, on October 12 before flying to Australia."}

My whole life has been a big lie. I don't know who I am at this point.\n\n'My parents decided to come clean to me and tell me that the person I thought was my dad, wasn't my dad,' Shayla told Khloe.\n\nLife changer: Toby hugged Shayla after proposing at her big reveal party\n\nThe ring: Shayla had an engagement ring slipped onto her finger\n\n'She was like ''I think your dad died in 2013'', just like that. I did not really have a reaction it was jarring and very devastating.\n\n'I researched him online and found his obituary online, he played in the NFL and died at 61 and has four other children out there somewhere.\n\n'I am pissed off at my parents. The relationship with my mom is damaged big time. We don't speak. My parents are very religious and I grew up a Jehovah's Witness.'\n\nGetting emotional: Khloe listened as Shayla told about being lied to about her biological father\n\nShayla told the cameras that her mother felt she was living in sin with boyfriend Toby despite her own actions.\n\n'After my parents came clean to me I started to beast eat to feel better, but gaining all this weight has made me feel worse. I don't like to admit I am broken, I have never been broken before.

The episode also revealed that Jon\u2019s real name is actually Aegon Targaryen and that Daenerys is his aunt.\n\nSo when Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen made love on their boat ride to the North, fans were freaked out by the incestuous scene. The same goes for the actors that played the characters, Kit Harington and Emilia Clarke.\n\nThe Game of Thrones stars admitted that they were blown away by the revelation that complicates their budding romance.\n\nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Emilia Clarke shared her thoughts on how Daenerys will react when she finds out that Jon is her nephew. The 30-year-old actress predicted that the Mother of Dragons will probably be grossed out by the incestuous pairing.\n\n\u201cEwwwww! I think that\u2019s how it\u2019s going to go.

The 30-year-old actor shared his opinion as to what could possibly happen to the couple.\n\n\u201cThat part of it, I can\u2019t predict. It could be them walking off into the sunset. It could be them killing each other.\u201d\n\nThe showrunners of Game of Thrones appeared to agree that the revelation would change Jon (Aegon) and Daenerys\u2019 relationship. D.B. Weiss revealed that the truth \u201cwill inevitably, if not tear them apart, at least cause real problems in their relationship.\u201d\n\nDavid Benioff backed up the claims, adding that it complicates something that would\u2019ve been \u201cperfect.\u201d\n\nKit Harington admitted that the revelation will definitely affect Jon and Deanarys romance. [Image by Charles Sykes/AP Images]\n\nIn the same interview, Kit Harington also talked about Jon (Aegon) and Daenerys\u2019s chemistry despite not working together for six years. The actor admitted that the length of their time together in Game of Thrones has helped a lot in delivering their scenes effectively.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re both kind of freaking out about it. I would be like, \u2018What\u2019s the sexual tension in this scene?\u2019 and she\u2019s like, \u2018Stop talking about sexual tension!\u2019 It\u2019s a unique experience to be in as an actor and you know the world is watching.\u201d\n\nEmilia Clarke then quipped, \u201cYeah [I would say], \u2018Would you just stop?

D'Andra dared the two to get married right then and there, but the couple demurred. Previews for this season show the Dallas ladies discussing LeeAnne's relationship and wondering why she and Rich haven't set a date. Given that LeeAnne's engagement happened on cameras, fans have been wondering if their wedding will be a part of RHOD as well.\n\n\"I have always said that I would share it with our audience because I feel like I've taken them down the journey of watching me get engaged on camera,\" LeeAnne told The Daily Dish podcast. \"A lot of people were like, 'You planned that!' I'm like, 'Sweetie, that was the one and only time he was ever asked me with a ring was then. I mean, what you saw was the first time that he's ever asked me. That was his real moment and my real moment. And that was our real joy. And I really wanted to share that with our audience. So, yeah, I'm going to share my wedding with our audience.\"\n\nIn fact, LeeAnne wants the cameras there to capture all of the intimate moments of the day \u2014 and it doesn't sound like anything is off-limits. \"The wedding is a ceremony that I think people should get to enjoy. I mean, I want you to see if I get nervous or, God forbid, I trip in my wedding dress or my flowers die in my hands as I'm walking down the street or lightning strikes me and whole church burns up. I want to share all that,\" she laughed.\n\nGiven the special occasion, The Daily Dish podcast asked if Rich would be jazzing up his eye patch, which he has worn ever since sustaining damage to one eye.\n\n\"No, I will not bling him a patch, people. Come on now,\" LeeAnne said. \"Every single one of my friends is like, 'I'll bling that for you. You want me to put some rhinestones on that patch?' I'm like, \"Y'all, it's not an accessory. Losing your vision is not an accessory; it's a tragedy.\"\n\nIt sounds like Rich will be making his wedding day ensemble decisions all on his own: \"I don't have to drag him everywhere and tell him what to dress and how to dress and all that. I let him do him. And then every night, I let him do me,\" she joked.\n\nLeeAnne and Rich's wedding is definitely a hot topic this season. Make sure to tune in to RHOD every Wednesday at 9/8c.

But there is cause for concern for fans of the Italian gal.\n\nCredit: Charles Sykes/Bravo\n\nAccording to court documents obtained by TMZ, Teresa failed to report two traffic tickets while under supervised release (aka probation) for her fraud conviction.\n\nThe first violation was for an illegal turn last year, and at the time, the 44-year-old was warned that if she had any other contact with police, she had to report it.\n\nCredit: Instagram\n\nUnfortunately, she didn\u2019t do that when, last month, she was cited for using her cell phone while driving.\n\nBecause she didn\u2019t tell her parole officer, it says in the docs that she will go to court should she violate the terms of her probation again.\n\nA post shared by Teresa Giudice (@teresagiudice) on May 3, 2017 at 5:00am PDT\n\nOn the other hand, the mother of four\u2019s attorney, James Leonard, Jr., is telling a different story.\n\nIn a statement to the press, the lawyer claims both tickets were reported \u2014 just not within the \u201crequired time frame.\u201d\n\nA post shared by Teresa Giudice (@teresagiudice) on Mar 24, 2017 at 3:39pm PDT\n\n\u201cTeresa's been fully compliant other than these incidents,\u201d he starts.\n\nJames continues, \u201cBoth she and I have spoken to her officer and understand exactly what is required should she have any future contact with law enforcement, which we do not anticipate will happen.\u201d\n\nA post shared by Teresa Giudice (@teresagiudice) on May 9, 2017 at 12:14pm PDT\n\nIn other words, he doesn\u2019t \u201canticipate\u201d that she\u2019ll be violating traffic laws anytime soon, but if she is, she knows to report it to her P.O. ASAP.\n\nFor now, it seems she\u2019s just on a warning status, and hopefully she keeps it that way.\n\nA post shared by Teresa Giudice (@teresagiudice) on Apr 14, 2017 at 5:02am PDT"}

She was a person who took delight in hurting you.\u201d\n\nWhen Dr. Phil asked what she loved most about her mom, the singer replied: \u201cWhat I love about my mother is that she\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\nSinead \u2013 who has battled with her mental health for a number of years \u2013 reportedly asked Dr. Phil to be interviewed just a month after she shared an emotional video on Facebook where she hinted at having suicidal thoughts.\n\nThe Grammy winner posted the 12-minute footage on Facebook in early August, revealing she was all alone and struggling to live every day.\n\nWeeping, Sinead said: \u201cI\u2019m all by myself.\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s absolutely nobody in my life except my doctor, my psychiatrist, the sweetest man on Earth, who says I\u2019m his hero, and that\u2019s about the only thing keeping me alive at the moment\u2026 and that\u2019s kind of pathetic.\u201d\n\nsee also Inside Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor's hotel room breakdown \u201cI am now living in a Travelodge motel in the...\n\n\u201cI am now living in a Travelodge motel in the a**e end of New Jersey,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cI want everyone to know what it\u2019s like, that\u2019s why I\u2019m making this video.\n\n\u201cMental illness, it\u2019s like drugs, it doesn\u2019t give a s*** who you are, and equally what\u2019s worse, it\u2019s the stigma, it doesn\u2019t give a s*** who you are.\n\nThe Irish singer has previously revealed her health struggles, having to undergo emergency surgery in 2016.\n\nThe star also sparked concerns last year when she disappeared for more than 36 hours after going on a bike ride in Chicago.\n\nFollowing her Facebook video, The DailyMail.com revealed Sinead is in a hospital in New Jersey and a pal also revealed on her Facebook page she is \u201csurrounded by love and receiving the best of care.\u201d"}

{"label": true, "txt": "Get the latest from TODAY Sign up for our newsletter\n\n/ Source: TODAY By Donna Freydkin\n\nSince actress Christina Applegate was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008 and had a double mastectomy thereafter, she\u2019s taken steps to change her entire lifestyle, from the food she eats to the rest she gets. She also founded the Right Action for Women, which helps at-risk women pay for MRI screenings and testing.\n\nBut the actress revealed in a TODAY.com exclusive that she recently took an additional step to prevent another cancer diagnosis: She had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed. Read on for our conversation with the actress, who\u2019s busy raising her daughter Sadie, 6, with musician hubby Martyn LeNoble.\n\nFirst off, let\u2019s catch up on your health. How are you doing?\n\nYou're the first person I'm telling this. Two weeks ago, I had my ovaries and [fallopian] tubes removed. My cousin passed away from ovarian cancer in 2008. I could prevent that. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve taken control of everything. It\u2019s a relief. That\u2019s one other thing off the table. Now, let\u2019s hope I don\u2019t get hit by a bus.\n\nWhat message do you want to send to women?\n\nIf you\u2019re BRCA positive, it\u2019s highly possible you\u2019ll develop cancer in your lifetime. The first thing is to be really diligent about what you\u2019re putting into your body, as far as what kind of food you\u2019re eating. Organic is expensive. I get that. I don\u2019t want to alienate anyone who can\u2019t pay for that. But maybe skip your morning latte and get organic vegetables for the week. Try to stay away from the foods that are filled with chemicals. Be a little more diligent and carve out as much of the bad stuff that you can. The other big killer is stress. That\u2019s a hard thing to say to people especially right now. We\u2019re living in a bizarre time. We\u2019re bombarded by what\u2019s going on in our world. Breathe deeper. That\u2019s a big one for me. I used to be a stressed out person. I\u2019m not anymore. I try to find the lining in everything in life.\n\nChristina Applegate Stacie McChesney / Getty Images\n\nI know you eat super clean.\n\nWe grow our own vegetables. That\u2019s not an option for everyone. But just get a tomato plant! We\u2019re a 100 percent organic house. My daughter is a vegetarian and practically vegan. That\u2019s her choice. That\u2019s how she eats. We\u2019re really conscious about what we buy. Get some kale! Plant some green kale in your backyard and throw it into everything.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty impressive that you founded Right Action for Women, because these tests cost a fortune and most women can\u2019t afford them.\n\nWe\u2019re at this place where we need to sit down and figure out the future of what it is that we\u2019re doing and get into more of the BRCA tests for women. That\u2019s a huge cost for a lot of people who don\u2019t have perfect insurance. If you do know you have the gene, it gives you an empowerment about your lifestyle. I\u2019ve been a stay-at-home mom and focusing on my daughter the last two years. We\u2019re moving forward now.\n\nIt must weigh on you that you have a daughter, and it must make breast cancer that much more of a personal issue\n\nOf course. The chances that my daughter is BRCA positive are very high. I look at her and feed her the cleanest foods. I try to keep her stress levels down. I\u2019m doing everything I can on my end knowing that in 20 years, she\u2019ll have to start getting tested. Hopefully by then there will be advancements. It breaks my heart to think that\u2019s a possibility.\n\nDo you get checked out regularly?\n\nI don\u2019t need mammograms anymore. I don\u2019t have breasts. I go every six months to my oncologist. It used to be every three months. They still check me out as if I had all my parts. That\u2019s never going to go away. If you know you\u2019re high risk, you need to go start as soon as possible.\n\nOtherwise, what\u2019s your life like these days?\n\nI feel good. I keep my life really simple. I\u2019m very fortunate right now to have that freedom to not work. I love being my daughter\u2019s mother and being 24/7 here with her, doing what I need to do, making her meals, taking her to soccer. I work at her school six or seven hours a week. I\u2019m all in. That is my job. I love my life right now. I\u2019ve been very fortunate to be able to take a minute and it\u2019s been wonderful."}

But we weren\u2019t expecting the other newcomer, Zach Galifianakis, who co-created his niche FX comedy \u2014 about a very sad clown \u2014 with Louis C.K. (a five-time nominee in this category). Jeffrey Tambor is the one to beat: The \u201cTransparent\u201d actor has, somewhat controversially, taken home the trophy for the past two years. Glover could definitely claim victory, but don\u2019t overlook any of the others: Aziz Ansari, Anthony Anderson and William H. Macy all landed repeat nominations, so the trophy could really go to anyone.\n\nOutstanding Lead Actress in a Limited Series or a Movie\n\nNicole Kidman, \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d (HBO)\n\nReese Witherspoon, \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d (HBO)\n\nJessica Lange, \u201cFeud: Bette and Joan\u201d (FX)\n\nSusan Sarandon, \u201cFeud: Bette and Joan\u201d (FX)\n\nCarrie Coon, \u201cFargo\u201d (FX)\n\nFelicity Huffman, \u201cAmerican Crime\u201d (ABC)\n\nImmediate reaction: Four Oscar winners + two acclaimed shows = toughest category of the Emmys? As many assumed, both Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon will feud for the prize for \u201cFeud,\u201d and Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon will go head to head for the addictive \u201cBig Little Lies.\u201d Even the most seasoned award-show expert will tell you this one is impossible to predict.\n\nOutstanding Lead Actor in a Limited Series or a Movie\n\nRiz Ahmed, \u201cThe Night Of\u201d (HBO)\n\nJohn Turturro, \u201cThe Night Of\u201d (HBO)\n\nEwan McGregor, \u201cFargo\u201d (FX)\n\nRobert De Niro, \u201cThe Wizard of Lies\u201d (HBO)\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch, \u201cSherlock: The Lying Detective\u201d (PBS)\n\nGeoffrey Rush, \u201cGenius\u201d (National Geographic)\n\nImmediate reaction: Even though \u201cThe Night Of\u201d will be more than a year old by the time the Emmy Awards actually roll around, this seems like the limited series that Emmy voters would most likely adore. And no surprise to see the love for Robert De Niro, a longtime award show favorite, or that the voters fell for the mysterious charms of Benedict Cumberbatch\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series\n\nAnn Dowd, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d (Hulu)\n\nSamira Wiley, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d (Hulu)\n\nUzo Aduba, \u201cOrange is the New Black\u201d (Netflix)\n\nMillie Bobby Brown, \u201cStranger Things\u201d (Netflix)\n\nThandie Newton, \u201cWestworld\u201d (HBO)\n\nChrissy Metz, \u201cThis Is Us\u201d (NBC)\n\nImmediate reaction: Another tough one that could have gone in a bunch of different directions, but as always, Uzo Aduba is a shoo-in \u2014 whether OITNB is competing as a comedy or a drama \u2014 and there\u2019s no way the adorable Millie Bobby Brown would\u2019ve gone unrecognized. Come awards night, it will likely turn into a showdown between \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d supporting cast, as critics rave about both Samira Wiley and Ann Dowd.\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series\n\nJonathan Banks, \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d (AMC)\n\nJohn Lithgow, \u201cThe Crown\u201d (Netflix)\n\nMandy Patinkin, \u201cHomeland\u201d (Showtime)\n\nMichael Kelly, \u201cHouse Of Cards\u201d (Netflix)\n\nDavid Harbour, \u201cStranger Things\u201d (Netflix)\n\nRon Cephas Jones, \u201cThis Is Us\u201d (NBC)\n\nJeffrey Wright, \u201cWestworld\u201d (HBO)\n\nImmediate reaction: Emmy voters understandably couldn\u2019t resist Ron Cephas Jones\u2019s crushingly sad storyline in \u201cThis Is Us.\u201d This category was a wildcard, and Jones joins several new names, including David Harbour, John Lithgow and Jeffrey Wright. And after a couple years off the list, Mandy Patinkin is no doubt thrilled to be back.\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series\n\nVanessa Bayer, \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d (NBC)\n\nLeslie Jones, \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d (NBC)\n\nKate McKinnon, \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d (NBC)\n\nKathryn Hahn, \u201cTransparent\u201d (Amazon)\n\nJudith Light, \u201cTransparent\u201d (Amazon)\n\nAnna Chlumsky, \u201cVeep\u201d (HBO)\n\nImmediate reaction: No shocker to see the women of SNL show up here, though Kate McKinnon (last year\u2019s winner) or Leslie Jones probably has the edge over Vanessa Bayer\u2019s farewell season. One wildcard: Anna Chlumsky\u2019s fifth consecutive nomination on \u201cVeep,\u201d always an Emmy obsession.\n\nOutstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series\n\nLouie Anderson, \u201cBaskets\u201d (FX)\n\nTy Burrell, \u201cModern Family (ABC)\n\nAlec Baldwin, \u201cSat urday Night Live\u201d (NBC)\n\nTituss Burgess, \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d (Netflix)\n\nTony Hale, \u201cVeep\u201d (HBO)\n\nMatt Walsh, \u201cVeep\u201d (HBO)\n\nImmediate reaction: It\u2019s an eighth(!) consecutive Emmy nomination for Ty Burrell. As \u201cModern Family\u201d loses its buzz, why do voters always prefer him over his co-stars? It\u2019s been a few years since Ed O\u2019Neill and Jesse Tyler Ferguson were nominated. We digress. This category is fairly predictable, and let\u2019s just say it would be shocking if Alec Baldwin wasn\u2019t onstage in September accepting a trophy for his portrayal of Trump.\n\nOutstanding Reality-Competition Program\n\n\u201cThe Voice\u201d (NBC)\n\n\u201cThe Amazing Race\u201d (CBS)\n\n\u201cTop Chef\u201d (Bravo)\n\n\u201cProject Runway\u201d (Lifetime)\n\n\u201cRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u201d (Logo)\n\n\u201cAmerican Ninja Warrior\u201d (NBC)\n\nImmediate reaction: RuPaul\u2019s beloved reality competition gets its first nod in the category alongside the shows that have all been here before, including perennial favorites \u201cThe Amazing Race,\u201d \u201cTop Chef\u201d and \u201cThe Voice,\u201d which has won the last two years in a row. As reality-TV expert Andy Dehnart pointed out before the nominations, over the last decade, only eight(!) shows have been nominated in this category overall. RuPaul\u2019s makes it nine, so it\u2019s refreshing to have any new names on the list.\n\nOutstanding Variety Talk Series\n\n\u201cLate Show with Stephen Colbert\u201d (CBS)\n\n\u201cLast Week Tonight with John Oliver\u201d (HBO)\n\n\u201cJimmy Kimmel Live\u201d (ABC)\n\n\u201cFull Frontal with Samantha Bee\u201d (TBS)\n\n\u201cLate Late Show with James Corden\u201d (CBS)\n\n\u201cReal Time with Bill Maher\u201d (HBO)\n\nImmediate reaction: Sorry, Jimmy Fallon \u2014 we\u2019re not saying that ruffling Donald Trump\u2019s hair is the reason you didn\u2019t make it in this year, but that move angered a lot critics. Taking his place is Stephen Colbert, the host who was snubbed last year after a rocky start on \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d but is having the time of his life in 2017 covering the political chaos.\n\n[Stephen Colbert\u2019s \u2018Late Show\u2019 got an Emmy nomination.

Otherwise, this category played out as expected, and it\u2019s a nice win for National Geographic\u2019s \u201cGenius,\u201d the network\u2019s Albert Einstein biopic and first scripted drama series.\n\nOutstanding TV Movie\n\n\u201cBlack Mirror\u201d (Netflix)\n\n\u201cDolly Part on\u2019s Christ mas Of M any Colors: Circle Of Love\u201d (NBC)\n\n\u201cImmortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\u201d (HBO)\n\n\u201cSherlock: The Lying Detective\u201d (PBS)\n\n\u201cThe Wizard of Lies\u201d (HBO)\n\nImmediate reaction: \u201cWait, \u2018Black Mirror\u2019 isn\u2019t a movie,\u201d you might say. \u201cJust a really creepy TV show!\u201d You are correct \u2014 but the critically beloved episode \u201cSan Junipero\u201d (a love story between characters played by Mackenzie Davis and Gugu Mbatha-Raw) was submitted as a TV movie, and deemed eligible.

The drama hails from Warner Bros. Television-based Berlanti Productions.\n\nIn the role of Sabrina, the Mad Men grad will star as an empowered young woman who is just beginning her dark education as a sorceress, even as she tries to maintain a normal life as a sophomore at Baxter High.\n\nThe rest of the cast includes Miranda Otto, Lucy Davis, Ross Lynch, Michelle Gomez, Chance Perdomo, Jaz Sinclair, Richard Coyle, Tati Gabrielle, Adeline Rudolph, Abigail Cowen, Lachlan Watson, Bronson Pinchot and Gavin Leatherwood.\n\nChilling Adventures of Sabrina releases its first 10-episode season Oct. 26 on Netflix.

For example, if you are a power player at work in need of an equally impactful garbs, Scandal and House of Cards are good places to start. Or, if you're a high school senior in need of a summer wardrobe that will reap heart-eye emojis on Instagram, binge-watching Riverdale is a promising solution.\n\nThe only caveat is that watching TV is similar to window shopping\u2014it's hard to tell who is wearing what.

{"label": true, "txt": "When \u201cMom\u201d premiered in 2013, the mother-daughter duo of Christy and Bonnie Plunkett had been estranged for years after Bonnie (Allison Janney) had neglected her daughter throughout her childhood \u2014 lost for many years to her addiction \u2014 which was then a cycle Christy (Anna Faris) repeated. Tension, especially for a sitcom, was high from the start, with both characters being \u201cextremely flawed,\u201d says co-creator and executive producer Gemma Baker.\n\n\u201cI think people assume we started \u2018Mom\u2019 with a desire to do a show about a mother-and-daughter relationship, but our starting place, as I remember it, was actually the word \u2018redemption,\u2019\u201d Baker says. \u201cWe loved the idea that you would be able to watch characters completely turn their lives around over the course of the series. The whole point of \u2018Mom\u2019 was to make a show that would give people hope.\u201d\n\nIn order to be successful in such a grand endeavor, the series in many ways was going to live or die by its casting.\n\nFaris had been in the comedy world since she helped the Wayans brothers launch the \u201cScary Movie\u201d franchise in 2000, but her resume read much heavier in film titles than television ones. In 2004 she had a recurring guest-star arc on the final season of Warner Bros. mega-hit \u201cFriends\u201d and then she went on to play a version of herself in HBO\u2019s Hollywood-set bro-comedy \u201cEntourage.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t until she booked \u201cMom\u201d in 2013 that she nabbed her first starring television comedy role.\n\nRelated Chuck Lorre Gets Personal as Kudos Pile Up for 'The Kominsky Method' Chuck Lorre Talks Benefits of Producing 'The Kominsky Method' for Netflix\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something about Anna as a human being that makes you care and root for her. You want her to succeed in life,\u201d says co-creator and executive producer Chuck Lorre. \u201cShe\u2019s a very skilled actress and she can do comedy and she can do the dramatic moments and she can do slapstick and the whole range of acting. But beyond that, just [as a] person [she] is very empathetic.\u201d\n\nFaris was the first person cast when CBS ordered the pilot into production for the 2013-14 television season. She booked the role of Christy Plunkett at the end of January, and with one of two major roles down, producers then turned to finding someone who would balance \u2014 and also have natural chemistry with \u2014 Faris for the role of her mother.\n\nJanney certainly wasn\u2019t a stranger to comedy in 2013 \u2014 she had appeared in such roles in films including \u201cDrop Dead Gorgeous\u201d and \u201c10 Things I Hate About You,\u201d as well as in guest-star spots on sitcoms including \u201cFrasier.\u201d But she was certainly better known for her dramatic turns \u2014 namely her Emmy-winning performance as CJ Cregg in \u201cThe West Wing\u201d \u2014 when she booked the role of Bonnie later that same January.\n\n\u201cAllison Janney is one of our great actresses, for whatever the requirement might be \u2014 she\u2019s the master of the craft,\u201d Lorre says. \u201cShe connected with Anna on a very deep level that created a team, that created a unit. They became a comedic team and when the comedy was put aside and the moments were being played just for what they were, it was something special and you could feel it when you were watching.\u201d\n\nFaris and Janney may not necessarily resemble each other physically, but the relationship they have developed certainly defines family.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been in awe of her,\u201d Faris says of Janney. \u201cFrom the first season, we always had this kindred spirit element about us. We would hang out after work all the time, we\u2019d get to work early to just decompress or go over lines. We\u2019re incredibly close, and I learn from her. Whenever we have a scene that\u2019s just the two of us, it feels like this incredible dance partnership because we can anticipate each other\u2019s moves. I\u2019m so lucky and fortunate, and I couldn\u2019t love her more. I don\u2019t know what I would do without her.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe loved the idea that you would be able to watch characters completely turn their lives around over the course of the series. The whole point of \u2018Mom\u2019 was to make a show that would give people hope.\u201d\n\nGemma Baker\n\nJanney says that everyone already knew Faris was \u201chysterically funny,\u201d but now they have learned she is gifted dramatically as well.\n\n\u201cFrom the beginning she has made such brave emotional choices, and over time I think she has really begun to trust herself in that area and take more risks,\u201d Janney says. \u201cWorking with her this closely and this long has been one of the best parts of doing this show.\u201d\n\nAt times, some of the humor on \u201cMom\u201d comes from the women taking jabs at each other and their checkered history, but they also provide many more tender, serious and heartwarming moments, too. It is this balance that has become the quintessential tone for the show.\n\n\u201cI have always felt that one of the reasons that the show works is because of how much Anna and Allison love each other in real life,\u201d Baker says. \u201cThat love and respect comes through even when Christy and Bonnie are fighting, and it\u2019s what makes those scenes enjoyable to watch.\u201d"}

{"label": true, "txt": "The Bachelor franchise is a fascinating study in how reality shows build characters. They\u2019re shaped, of course, by the footage editors choose to air\u2014though it always helps when Bachelors, Bachelorettes, and their would-be suitors come in with personalities of their own, ready to be enhanced and exaggerated into TV gold. Last year, Rachel Lindsay proved she\u2019s a smart, no-nonsense lawyer with an occasionally risqu\u00e9 sense of humor. Before her, there was Joelle \u201cJoJo\u201d Fletcher, a bubbly Texan who felt like an amalgamation of every Southern Girl trope\u2014a somewhat obvious identity, but a clear one.\n\nThis year\u2019s Bachelorette, though, is tougher to pin down. What is Rebecca \u201cBecca\u201d Kufrin\u2019s \u201cthing\u201d\u2014and does The Bachelorette even care if she has one?\n\nThroughout this season, as we\u2019ve gotten to know Becca\u2019s contestants, it\u2019s become increasingly clear that we also don\u2019t know much about the woman whose heart they\u2019re competing to win. Nothing about Becca feels particularly specific, beyond the information one could find on a title card. She\u2019s from Minnesota. She works in P.R. What else? You\u2019d be hard pressed to think of much.\n\nInstead, Becca continues to be defined by the incident that landed her the Bachelorette gig in the first place: her horrific breakup with Arie Luyendyk Jr. on the last season of The Bachelor. Which is frustrating. A breakup can make for a good beginning, but the rest of the story has to go somewhere. And rather than build Becca up as a character and give her a redemptive romantic romp, this season has appeared more than happy to let her simply exist as a passive participant in her own story.\n\nMost of this season\u2019s most intense drama has occurred offscreen, as when viewers found out that front-runner Garrett Yrigoyen has an appalling social-media history, and eliminated contestant Lincoln Adim had been convicted of assault and battery. Within the confines of the series itself, however, the proceedings have been pretty rote: there was the requisite feud between two equally annoying contestants, the jealous meltdown, and the cool guy eliminated too soon. Arie\u2019s season of The Bachelor was widely called out for being boring, and now, Becca\u2019s, which sprang from that dull well, appears to have committed the same sin. That reality grew even more stark as the show betrayed its apparent true goal this week: making sure there is at least one potential Bachelor on lock for next year, even if the producers have to manufacture him out of thin air. They\u2019ll do anything to avoid having a Bachelor as uninspiring as Arie again.\n\nThe front-runner for that position is Jason Tartick, who was, unsurprisingly, sent home this week. While Jason might not have the charisma to carry a season of The Bachelor on his own, producers appeared to be setting him up to assume the mantle, should he need to.\n\nTwice during the episode, Becca found herself agonizing over the fact that she simply could not see a future with Jason. She left not one, but two conversations with Jason to pace, fidget with her hair, and release existential grumbles\u2014then finally let her doomed man go. And once he left, she kept flagellating herself for her decision, saying that she had blindsided Jason just like Arie blindsided her\u2014a comparison no sane person would make, but one the show allowed to hang in the air, almost as though it were actually true. The reason? That\u2019s exactly the kind of narrative that sets Jason up for eventual Bachelor-dom, as was the moment when Jason, who handled his breakup with relative aplomb, showed up at Becca\u2019s suite to give them both closure\u2014and leave Becca a scrapbook of relationship memories. The general message was hard to miss: \u201cJason is an amazing guy! What a sweetheart! So heartbroken! Looks kind of like Milo Ventimiglia in This Is Us! Maybe he\u2019d be a good Bachelor? Please don\u2019t make us reach back six years to find a Bachelor again; there\u2019s just no one good left back there!\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t doubt that Becca\u2019s interactions with Jason were genuine\u2014including her sobbing over his departure. But the way the ordeal was framed felt like some unmistakable pre-emptive branding. And while that might serve The Bachelor well in the future, it made for pretty stiff and contrived TV drama for Becca in the present.\n\nTo an extent, Bachelors and Bachelorettes are always rendered as empty vessels\u2014and perhaps that\u2019s the problem. Too often, this show feels more like a series of conventions, aesthetic gestures, and re-used beats than an actual story. In this context, \u201ccharacters,\u201d to whatever extent they develop, feel incidental. At its core, the Bachelor-verse is simply a self-sustaining empire of sponsored Instagram posts and free-for-exposure hotel stays, dressed up in sequin gowns and drowned in rose petals. Hell, even the Becca season\u2019s exotic trip location, Thailand, was recycled from just two seasons ago\u2014down to her date with jealous human soap bar Blake Horstmann, which mimicked JoJo\u2019s with Jordan Rodgers. Where\u2019s the sense of adventure and spontaneity that defines most people\u2019s dream love stories\u2014precisely what these programs purport to mimic?\n\nThis franchise has been chugging along for nearly two decades, and, at this point, longtime fans know its machinations by heart. Perhaps, instead of trying to make the current machine run smoother, it\u2019s time the Bachelor franchise rethink itself down to the nuts and bolts, and consider building something new. Because given the way ratings are trending, fans will only tolerate so many more seasons of swiftly abandoned catchphrases, contrived feuds, and central Bachelor/ettes whom editors only barely seem to understand\u2014or care about\u2014as characters."}

Kang then went a step further and revealed that Scott Wilson and Sonequa Martin-Green will be returning as their respective characters, Hershel and Sasha.\n\nWhat do Shane, Sasha, and Hershel's arrivals have to do with Andrew Lincoln as Rick Grimes leaving? Maybe nothing! But if a show's most important character is leaving said show, what better way to do so then to have him shepherded off into the sunset (metaphorical or literal) by a host of specters from the show's past?\n\nRegardless of their purpose in The Walking Dead Season 9, it will just be nice to have Shane, Sasha, and Hershel back.\n\nJon Bernthal as Shane operated as a sort of co-lead in the show's early seasons. Shane accidentally made his old buddy Rick a cuckold, sleeping with his wife after he thought Rick didn't make it through the apocalypse. He was a worthy foil for Rick in seasons 1 and 2, finally meeting his end following an ill-fated assassination attempt on Rick in the season 2 finale.\n\nScott Wilson as Hershel was introduced in season 2 and served as a wise councilor for the group. His farm was a safe(ish) haven for Rick's crew before it fell. Hershel lost his head at the hands of the Governor wielding Michonne's sword in season 4.\n\nSasha and actress Sonequa Martin-Green may have been one of The Walking Dead's most unfortunate losses. Originally introduced as merely Tyreese's sister, Sasha evolved into a strong character reminiscent of the comic series' Andrea. Martin-Green's performance was so strong that she was poached by CBS to be the lead on Star Trek: Discovery. Sasha sacrificed herself in a very ill advised attempt to take down Negan.\n\nHowever The Walking Dead Season 9 decides to bring these three back, it will be nice to see some old friends.\n\nAlec Bojalad is TV Editor at Den of Geek.

{"label": true, "txt": "Blake Tollison Shelton (born June 18, 1976)[1] is an American country singer, songwriter and television personality. In 2001, he made his debut with the single \"Austin\". The lead-off single from his self-titled debut album, \"Austin\" spent five weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart. The now Platinum-certified debut album also produced two more top 20 entries (\"All Over Me\" and \"Ol' Red\").[1] Although the album was released on Giant Records Nashville, he was transferred to Warner Bros. Records Nashville after Giant closed in late 2001.[citation needed]\n\nHis second and third albums, 2003's The Dreamer and 2004's Blake Shelton's Barn & Grill, are gold and platinum, respectively.[1] His fourth album, Pure BS (2007), was re-issued in 2008 with a cover of Michael Bubl\u00e9's pop hit \"Home\" as one of the bonus tracks.[2] His fifth album, Startin' Fires was released in November 2008.[1] It was followed by the extended plays Hillbilly Bone and All About Tonight in 2010, and the albums Red River Blue in 2011,[3] Based on a True Story... in 2013, Bringing Back the Sunshine in 2014, and If I'm Honest in 2016. As of June 2017 , Shelton has charted 33 singles, including 24 number ones,[4] 17 of which were consecutive. The 11th No. 1 (\"Doin' What She Likes\") broke \"the record for the most consecutive No. 1 singles in the Country Airplay chart's 24-year history\".[5] He is a seven-time Grammy Award nominee.[6]\n\nShelton is also known for his role as a judge on the televised singing competitions Nashville Star, Clash of the Choirs, and The Voice. He has been on The Voice since its inception, and in six of fifteen seasons (2\u20134, 7, 11, 13), a member of his team has won. From 2011 to 2015, Shelton was married to singer Miranda Lambert.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nShelton was born in Ada, Oklahoma, to Dorothy, a beauty salon owner, and Richard Shelton, a used car salesman. Shelton began singing at an early age and by the age of 12, he was taught how to play the guitar by his uncle.[7] By age 15, he had written his first song. By age 16, he had received a Denbo Diamond Award in his home state.[1] On November 13, 1990, his older brother Richie Shelton (who was 24) was killed in an automobile accident.[8] After graduating from high school at seventeen, he moved to Nashville, Tennessee to pursue a singing career. There he got a job at a music publishing company and, in 1997, he was aided by Bobby Braddock to obtain a production contract with Sony Music.[9]\n\nMusic career [ edit ]\n\nPerforming at the Crawford County Fair, Meadville, PA, in August 2005\n\n2001\u20132006: Beginnings [ edit ]\n\nSome years later in Nashville, he signed to Giant Records in 2001. In 2001, he was slated to release a song entitled \"I Wanna Talk About Me\" as a single. However, staff at the label considered the song unsuitable for a lead-off single, and the song was eventually recorded by Toby Keith, whose version was a number 1 single.[10]\n\nInstead, Giant released \"Austin\" as Shelton's debut single. Shortly after that song was released, Giant Records was closed, and Shelton was transferred to parent company Warner Bros. Records. \"Austin\" became Shelton's first number one hit on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts and spent five weeks at that position. Warner released Shelton's self-titled debut album, which was produced by songwriter Bobby Braddock. It also produced the Top 20 hits \"All Over Me\", which Shelton co-wrote with Earl Thomas Conley and Mike Pyle, and \"Ol' Red\".[1] Although Shelton's rendition of \"Ol' Red\" was not a major radio hit, he considers it his signature song, and it has become popular in concert.[11] The album received a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 1,000,000 copies.[12]\n\nThe album received a positive review from Maria Konicki Dinoia of Allmusic, who called \"Austin\" \"tremendously imaginative\" and praised Shelton for including songs written by Braddock and Conley.[13] Country Standard Time was less favorable, with Scott Homewood saying that the \"album just smacks of being assembled with the intent on capturing the burgeoning alternative country market\".[14]\n\nShelton's second album, The Dreamer, was first released on February 4, 2003, on Warner Bros. Records. Its lead-off single, \"The Baby\", reached No. 1 on the country charts, holding that position for three weeks. Although the second and third singles (\"Heavy Liftin'\" and \"Playboys of the Southwestern World\", respectively) only reached No.32 and No. 24, The Dreamer earned gold certification as well. He, along with Andy Griggs and Montgomery Gentry, sang guest vocals on Tracy Byrd's mid-2003 single \"The Truth About Men\". Blake Shelton's Barn & Grill was the title of Shelton's third studio album, released in 2004.[1] Its lead-off single, the Harley Allen co-write \"When Somebody Knows You That Well\", peaked at No.37 on the country charts, while the follow-up \"Some Beach\" became his third No.1 hit, holding that position for four weeks. It was followed by a cover of Conway Twitty's 1988 single \"Goodbye Time\".[15] Both this cover and its followup, \"Nobody but Me\", reached Top Ten for Shelton as well. As with his first album, Blake Shelton's Barn & Grill was certified platinum. Accompanying the album's release was a video collection entitled Blake Shelton's Barn & Grill: A Video Collection.[1]\n\nOn December 18, 2005, several of Shelton's songs, including \"Nobody but Me\", appeared on the TV movie The Christmas Blessing, starring Neil Patrick Harris, Rebecca Gayheart, Angus T. Jones, and Rob Lowe. Shelton had a small role at the end of the movie, playing himself at a benefit concert, singing \"Nobody but Me\".\n\n2006\u20132011: Pure BS and Startin' Fires [ edit ]\n\nShelton released his fourth studio album, Pure BS, in early 2007.[1] Unlike with his first three albums, which were produced entirely by Bobby Braddock, Shelton worked with Braddock, Brent Rowan, and Paul Worley as producers for this album. Its first two singles\u2014\"Don't Make Me\" and \"The More I Drink\"\u2014were both Top 20 hits on the country charts, respectively reaching No.12 and No. 19. Also in late 2007, Shelton made appearances on television shows: first as a judge on the talent competition Nashville Star, and later on Clash of the Choirs.\n\nPure BS was re-released in 2008 with three bonus tracks, including a cover of Michael Bubl\u00e9's hit single \"Home\". This cover, released in early 2008 as the album's third single, became his fourth No.1 hit in July.[16]\n\n\"Home\" was followed in August 2008 by the single \"She Wouldn't Be Gone\", his 14th chart entry and his fifth No. 1 hit. It was the first time in his career that he had two consecutive number ones. \"She Wouldn't Be Gone\" is the lead-off to Shelton's fifth studio album, Startin' Fires, which has also produced the single \"I'll Just Hold On.\" This album also includes \"Bare Skin Rug,\" a duet with Lambert.[17] It was produced by Scott Hendricks, except for one track which was produced by Brent Rowan, and another (\"I Don't Care\", which carried over from Pure BS) was produced by Braddock.[18] After \"I'll Just Hold On\" fell off the chart in October 2009, Blake Shelton released a duet with Trace Adkins titled \"Hillbilly Bone\". It was the lead single on Shelton's EP, Hillbilly Bone, released on March 2, 2010, through Reprise Records Nashville. After \"Hillbilly Bone\" reached No. 1 in February, came the August release of \"All About Tonight\", the lead-off single to his EP of the same name. In September, he released the second single from All About Tonight, \"Who Are You When I'm Not Looking\", his 18th single release. He released his first greatest hits album, Loaded: The Best of Blake Shelton in November 2010.\n\nShelton was invited to join the Grand Ole Opry during the September 28, 2010, \"Country Comes Home\" concert celebrating reopening of the Grand Ole Opry House after the Cumberland River flooded the Opry House in May 2010. The formal invitation was extended on his Twitter account and was announced by Opry star Trace Adkins.[19] He was formally inducted by Adkins at the October 23, 2010, Opry performance. Shelton recorded the title track for the remake of Footloose released on October 14, 2011. Shelton appeared on the 44th Annual Country Music Awards on November 10, 2010, where he performed \"All About Tonight\" and won Male Vocalist of the Year.[20]\n\nIn 2011, Shelton started working as a judge/coach to singers on the NBC reality television series The Voice.[21]\n\n2011\u20132012: The Voice, Red River Blue and Cheers, It's Christmas [ edit ]\n\nBlake Shelton released the album Red River Blue on July 12, 2011, led by the single, \"Honey Bee\". The song received 138,000 downloads in its first week and was certified gold in its seventh week, setting a record for the fastest gold certification by a male country singer.[22] On June 13, 2011, in its tenth chart week, \"Honey Bee\" went to No. 1 on the Hot Country Songs chart, becoming his ninth No. 1 and his fastest-climbing. The album was expected to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with around 110,000 copies sold.[23] \"God Gave Me You\", a cover of a Dave Barnes song, was the album's second single; it also reached No. 1. \"Drink on It\", the fifth song on the album, hit No. 1 in April 2012, giving him his 11th No. 1 song. On April 30, 2012, Blake performed \"Over\" on the Semi-finals of the second season of The Voice. \"Over\" became Shelton's seventh consecutive No. 1. and his 12th No. 1 hit to date.\n\nBlake Shelton is a coach on the NBC show The Voice.

It marked their first TV performance since their May 2011 wedding.\n\nIn October 2012, Shelton released his first Christmas album, Cheers, It's Christmas, which peaked at no. 1 and no. 2 respectively on the Top Holiday Albums and Top Country Albums charts.\n\nBlake Shelton appears on fellow \"Voice\" coach Christina Aguilera's album Lotus on the song \"Just a Fool\".\n\n2013\u20132014: Based on a True Story...

{"label": true, "txt": "We finally know why they got bad blood.\n\nThe truth behind the Taylor Swift and Katy Perry feud has been largely a mystery. We could guess it had something to do with backup dancers, as Swift previously told Rolling Stone her song \u201cBad Blood,\u201d rumored to be about Perry, was about a singer \u201cwho basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour.\u201d\n\nFacts were scant, though. Even with Perry\u2019s \u201cSwish, Swish,\u201d a song rumored to be about Swift that debuted last week (more than a year after Swift\u2019s track), we didn\u2019t know the full story.\n\nNow it\u2019s coming at you like a dark horse.\n\nDuring an extended \u201cPrimetime Carpool Karaoke Special\u201d on Monday night, Perry opened up about everything to host James Corden.\n\nAccording to Perry, the feud started because some of her usual dancers wanted to perform with Swift. Perry said she had no problem with the dancers\u2019 choice, but to make sure their contracts included a provision allowing them to drop out of Swift\u2019s ensemble when Perry went back on tour in a year or so.\n\nWell, when the time came for Perry to prepare for her tour, the dancers went to Swift\u2019s management to discuss leaving \u2015 and got fired.\n\n\u201cShe started it, and it\u2019s time for her to finish it,\u201d Perry told Corden. The singer said she tried to speak to Swift about the issue but noted, \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t speak to me.\u201d\n\nThe singer continued, \u201cIt was a full shutdown, and then she writes a song about me, and I\u2019m like, OK, cool, cool, cool, that\u2019s how you want to deal with it? Karma!\u201d\n\nThen Perry went off like a firework:\n\nBut what I want to say is that I\u2019m ready for that BS to be done. Now, there is the law of cause and effect. You do something, and there\u2019s going to be a reaction, and trust me, Daddy, there\u2019s going to be a reaction. It\u2019s all about karma, right? ... I think, personally, that women together, not divided, and none of this petty bullshit, women together will heal the world.\n\nPreach!\n\nAlthough the feud has now lasted years, Corden gets Perry to admit that it could all be erased with an apology text from Swift.\n\nWill they shake, shake, shake, shake, shake it off? Or are they never, ever, ever getting back together?"}

Berkshire is located about an hour out of London and is where Pippa and Kate's parents, Carole Middleton and Michael Middleton live. St Mark's Resident priest Rev Nick Wynne-Jones will officiate the ceremony, a spokeswoman at the church has told The Telegraph.\n\nThe reception location\n\nThe reception will also be an intimate affair, held in the Middleton\u2019s back garden. According to E!, the family home is an-acre Georgian Grade II-listed manor home. A giant glass marquee has now been erected at the back of Pippa Middleton\u2019s family home in the lead up to her wedding, fit to host 350 guests.\n\nThe Bachelorette party\n\nIt happened back in March: Pippa chose to go skiing with sister Kate Middleton and close friends at the French resort Meribel. Pippa picked the ski destination as her choice of getaway and as this source cited to The Sun, it was a small yet super luxe getaway: \u201cPippa loves skiing, so it was her first choice for a hen weekend. They stayed in a really exclusive catered chalet with maids and chef, who ensured that they were totally spoilt. The owners also wanted to impress their royal guests, so the girls were showered with gifts. They were given Swatch watches, Ugg slippers, leather-bound notebooks, and bespoke fragrances. It was a very small, private party, and they had an amazing time.\u201d Learn how to do a Hens night like Pippa here.\n\nThe wedding party\n\nThe Middleton\u2019s 27-year-old brother James Middleton is set to join Pippa's fianc\u00e9's three siblings to form the groomsmen, according to E!. There is no confirmation yet as to who will join Pippa. Prince George and Princess Charlotte are going to be taking on the roles of pageboy and bridesmaid respectively.\n\nThe role of Kate Middleton\n\nBack in November of last year, royal author, Judy Wade weighed in on the nuptials saying Kate will most likely not be playing any formal part in the wedding, as it would detract from her sister. Kate's name has been omitted from a list of official duties for the wedding released by Kensington Palace, which details Prince George and Princess Charlotte's roles. Royal experts are suggesting she will still play a smaller role, perhaps by giving a reading during the ceremony.\n\nThe guests\n\nThe couple has settled on 150 guests. Prince Harry is definitely attending and is bringing Meghan Markle. Pippa and Kate\u2019s business entrepreneur brother James Middleton is attending and bringing his partner Donna Air. The groom\u2019s reality television star brother, Spencer Matthews, who stars on Made In Chelsea, is coming, along with sister Nina Mackie. Spencer will also serve as the groom\u2019s best man at the nuptials. Spencer\u2019s girlfriend however, Vogue Williams, did not receive an invite. According to The Mirror, tennis star Roger Federer has confirmed he is attending the relaxed nuptials. Both the bride and groom are enthusiastic tennis fans, and Pippa has previously attended Wimbledon as a guest of Federer\u2019s. British broadcaster Ben Fogle has also received an invite to the wedding of the year.\n\nThe wedding work-out\n\nMiddleton has been undertaking a combination of yoga, pilates, dance and spin classes at the exclusive Grace Belgravia health club in London.\n\nThe dress code\n\nPippa Middleton has set an interesting dress code for guests. Middleton is requesting her guests pack one outfit for the ceremony, set to take place at St Mark\u2019s church, Englefield, Berkshire, and another outfit for the reception, which is reported to be taking place at her parents\u2019 home.\n\nThe arrival\n\nThe Sun has reported Pippa Middleton will arrive at her wedding in a horse-drawn carriage.\n\nThe dress\n\nGiles Deacon is the favorite after he was spotted meeting Pippa and her mother last November. \u201cI can never really comment on rumours,\u201d he told Hello!. \u201cUntil things are confirmed it's just rumors.\u201d Royal experts have also picked Jenny Packham and Victoria Beckham as favourites to dress Pippa. See our dress predictions here.\n\nThe beauty look\n\nJust four days before Pippa Middleton\u2019s wedding, Kate Middleton's hair stylist Amanda Cook Tucker has been spotted wheeling a suitcase into Pippa's Kensington home. According to The Daily Mail, Cook Tucker has spent time inside Pippa and James's home, likely creating a wedding day look for Pippa. Duchess Kate Middleton's personal hair stylist, Cook Tucker, is known for her elaborate up-dos and so royal watchers are tipping this means she is creating one of her classic looks for Pippa on her wedding day."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Today is National Wine Day\u2014one of those mysterious holidays that seem to spring fully formed from your Facebook or Twitter feed. A Google search leaves the holiday\u2019s origins ambiguous but seems to at least source it to a year: 2009. So happy Seventh-Annual National Wine Day, everyone. Who are we to argue with such a fantastic idea? To put you in the mood to guzzle some grapes, here are 20 TV characters who know their way around a bottle. Let their hardy livers inspire you.\n\nTyrion Lannister\u2014Game of Thrones\n\nThe shortest member of the Lannister clan is, nonetheless, its most accomplished drinker. Ever since Tyrion made his first appearance in the pilot he\u2019s not been too far from a wine bottle, goblet, or skin.\n\nCersei Lannister\u2014Game of Thrones\n\nBut if anyone could give Tyrion a run for his money in the drinking department, it\u2019s his sister: Cersei. The thirst she developed when holed up during the Battle of the Blackwater in Season 2 has only increased in the intervening years. Maybe if she had been drinking less and scheming more, Season 5 wouldn\u2019t have gone quite so terribly for her.\n\nAlicia Florrick\u2014The Good Wife\n\nAlicia recently got in trouble with her neighbors for running a law office out of her swanky Chicago apartment. But if I shared a recycling bin with the Florrick household, I would have raised a few flags long before. But, as Alicia puts it, she doesn\u2019t need wine\u2014she likes wine. For the record, she likes tequila too.\n\nLindsay Jillian\u2014You\u2019re the Worst\n\nAny one of the four core characters on this show could have cropped up here but somehow I think Linds is the most inclined to prefer wine. It\u2019s classy, just like her. I\u2019ll see you all back here on National Trash Juice Day when we celebrate all things Vernon.\n\nRobin Scherbatsky\u2014How I Met Your Mother\n\nIt\u2019s possible now that she\u2019s found a happily ever after with Ted, Robin is less inclined to drink under a desk while weeping. Then again, when Ted gets out his red cowboy boots, we won\u2019t blame Robin for taking a deep swig, or 20.\n\nThe Cul-de-sac Crew\u2014Cougar Town\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a Big Carl or Big Joe to call your very own, then fill the closest vase with all the wine you have, make fun of your neighbors, play Penny Can, and fondly remember this late, great show.\n\nTami Taylor\u2014Friday Night Lights\n\nTruth be told, both Eric and Tami Taylor enjoyed unwinding with a glass of wine, but I decided to put Mrs. Coach on here because . . .\n\nAmy Schumer\u2014Inside Amy Schumer\n\n. . . Amy Schumer paid such a beautiful homage to Connie Britton\u2019s character in her sketch \u201cFootball Town Nights.\u201d Bleary eyes, full glass, can\u2019t lose.\n\nBernard Black\u2014Black Books\n\nI don\u2019t recommend trying Bernard Black\u2019s wine popsicle (or ice lolly if you\u2019re British) at home. Freezing a full, glass wine bottle sounds like a recipe for disaster. But if you can pull it off, more power to you, and may I suggest a nice ros\u00e9?\n\nLiz Lemon\u201430 Rock\n\nYou know what pairs well with Night Cheese? Treadmill wine. But if neither of those sounds good, you might want to try some of Liz Lemon\u2019s patented Funky Juice. Find the recipe here.\n\nHannibal Lecter\u2014Hannibal\n\nWhat good is an elegantly prepared meal without a nice Chianti to wash it down?\n\nCarrie Mathison\u2014Homeland\n\nI don\u2019t, however, recommend you wash down your meds with wine. But if you do, make sure you\u2019re ready to blow your life up completely and repeatedly.\n\nKathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb\u2014The Today Show\n\nO.K., yes, Kathie Lee and Hoda aren\u2019t exactly characters, but, well, aren\u2019t they? Like Tami Taylor before her, Kathie Lee got her own loving send-up courtesy of *S.N.L.\u2019*s Kristen Wiig. Wiig\u2019s preferred accessory? A wine glass, of course.\n\nEdina Monsoon and Patsy Stone\u2014Absolutely Fabulous\n\nEddie and Patsy\u2014maybe the original Hoda and Kathie Lee?\u2014are back in the news today thanks to the teaser for their upcoming movie. As you might expect, the women have not changed their hard-drinking ways one bit. You wouldn\u2019t want it any other way, would you, sweetie darling?\n\nSkyler White\u2014Breaking Bad\n\nWhen things got especially rough in the White household, Skyler turned to some classic white-wine therapy to get her through tense dinners and even tenser nights. I\u2019d like to think that with a little bit of closure from Walt, Skyler is no longer hitting the bottle quite as hard. But she should go ahead and do whatever she needs to do to get through. She deserves it.\n\nOlivia Pope\u2014Scandal\n\nIf you decide to go full Olivia Pope today and drink red wine while wearing white, then I take my over-sized white hat off to you. You\u2019re a braver drinker than most of us.\n\nGet Vanity Fair\u2019s HWD Newsletter Sign up for essential industry and award news from Hollywood. E-mail Address Subscribe"}

{"label": true, "txt": "A few things are constant on Bravo\u2019s hugely popular Real Housewives reality shows: bitter fights, excessive alcohol consumption, and luxurious wealth. The latter is at least as much a strategic appearance as it is a financial fact for many of the stars. Some have been dealt serious blows to their investment portfolios, as when the housing crisis memorably hit the women of The Real Housewives of Orange County, the franchise\u2019s original program. But others, from Beverly Hills\u2019 unapologetically extravagant Lisa Vanderpump to Atlanta\u2019s legendary musician member Kandi Burruss, have the assets and bank statements to back up their swagger.\n\nMONEY compiled reporting on the estimated net worths of all the current regular stars of the Real Housewives shows. We should note: any \u201cnet worth site\u201d should be taken with a grain of salt, but using them we can get a picture of who are the richest housewives on each installment, ranked from the the richest to the merely rich.\n\nThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills: Lisa Vanderpump\n\n(L-R) Eden Sassoon, Lisa Vanderpump. Nicole Weingart/Bravo.\n\nEstimated net worth: $75 million\n\nThe stars of RHOBH are not shy about flaunting their wealth. They do so in ways that make other casts in the franchise look downright humble. That\u2019s especially true of Lisa Vanderpump, who reportedly has the highest net worth of all the current U.S. Housewives stars and has seemed indomitable over all eight seasons of the Beverly Hills show.\n\nThough castmates like Kyle Richards and Erika Jayne are doing more than well for themselves, Vanderpump rules over an opulent mansion with everything one could imagine (there was that time she even bought two miniature horses for her backyard and made it seem almost kind of normal). Together with her husband Ken Todd, she runs an enviable restaurant empire, including the Los Angeles hotspots SUR, Pump, and Villa Blanca, all of which get plenty of publicity on RHOBH. In addition to a reported salary of $500,000 per season of that show, her business is the center of the Bravo spinoff Vanderpump Rules, following her absurdly dramatic serving staff, for which she serves as an executive producer. The perpetually calm Vanderpump, meanwhile, is taking it all the way to the bank.\n\nThe Real Housewives of New York City: Carole Radziwill\n\n\"The Politics of Friendship\" Episode 905 with Carole Radziwill Heidi Gutman/Bravo.\n\nEstimated net worth: $50 million\n\nJournalist may not seem like the most likely career for a Real Housewife, but RHONY\u2019s Radziwill has received numerous accolades over a long career in broadcast news. She worked as a producer at ABC News and even won a Peabody for her work, which included being stationed in Iraq during the Gulf War. She also married a man of nobility, Prince Anthony Radziwill, which certainly accounts for her stunning net worth. Sadly, he died in 1999, an event she has written about in bestselling books including the memoir What Remains.\n\nThe Real Housewives of Atlanta: Kandi Burruss\n\n-R) Todd Tucker and Kandi Burruss Wilford Harewood/Bravo. (L\n\nEstimated net worth: $35 million\n\nEven if you don\u2019t recognize Burruss, you know her work.

The label triple threat doesn\u2019t even do her justice.\n\nThe Real Housewives of Orange County: Shannon Beador\n\n\"Mystic Mistake\" Episode 1215 \u2014 with Shannon Beador Nicole Weingart/Bravo.\n\nEstimated net worth: $20 million\n\nBeador may be the butt of some jokes on RHOC thanks to her New Agey personality and intense dedication to alternative medicine, but she has plenty of money to burn on her odd hobbies. Having joined the show during the ninth season, she\u2019s had public ups and downs with her husband, David Beador, the owner of a successful construction company. They announced a separation at the end of 2017, but it\u2019s unclear if they\u2019ve finalized a divorced. Even if they do, it\u2019s clear she\u2019ll still make out okay, as Beador\u2019s company reportedly pulls in more than $20 million in annual revenue.\n\nThe Real Housewives of Dallas: Stephanie Hollman\n\nTHE REAL HOUSEWIVES OF DALLAS with Stephanie Hollman Peter Larsen/Bravo\n\nEstimated net worth: $18 million\n\nThe other rookie in the Real Housewives lineup is RHOD, but its stars reported net worths can hold their own against the other entries. Born in a small town in Oklahoma, Hollman now reigns queen in Dallas, at least on this show. Her husband Travis owns and operates the Hollman locker company, which has been in his family since 1976 and counts among its clients the Chicago Cubs, the Los Angeles Lakers, the Dallas Mavericks, American Express, Facebook, and SoulCycle.\n\nThe Real Housewives of New Jersey: Teresa Giudice\n\n. Bravo\u2014NBCU\n\nEstimated net worth: $11 million\n\nGiudice has been present through all eight seasons of RHONJ, despite having a bumpy road. She spent nearly a year in prison for a fraud conviction and was released in 2015. But she had already proved her perseverance. During her run on the show, she\u2019s become a New York Times bestselling author with cookbooks inspired by her Italian heritage, including Skinny Italian and Fabulicious!. Between her publishing career and being a media personality, along with other sources of income, she\u2019s beat out her castmates to reach eight figures.\n\nThe Real Housewives of Potomac: Karen Huger\n\nTHE REAL HOUSEWIVES OF POTOMAC with Karen Huger Larry French/Bravo\u2014NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images\n\nEstimated net worth: $10 million\n\nOne of the new entries in the ever-expanding Real Housewives universe, RHOP\u2019s stars may not be as famous as their counterparts, but one at least has pulled in serious cash. Huger\u2019s husband Raymond is a software executive, whom she\u2019s referred to as \u201cthe black Bill Gates.\u201d But it\u2019s not all necessarily rosy for the couple, as Raymond and his company reportedly owe millions in back taxes."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Photo: Copyright 2018, FX Networks. All rights reserved.\n\nSpoilers below for The Americans series finale.\n\nIn retrospect, The Americans couldn\u2019t have ended any other way. By the time the closing credits rolled on the series finale, \u201cSTART,\u201d each character has suffered a major and particular tragedy: Philip and Elizabeth Jennings abandon their son Henry and lose their daughter Paige, Oleg Burov is locked up in prison as a spy, and Stan Beeman must forever reckon with his decision to let the Jennings escape. (If you\u2019re feeling especially down about this grim farewell, just look on the bright side: At least nobody died!) After giving ourselves a moment to decompress from such an intense series finale, the Vulture staff got together to debate a pressing question: Which character on The Americans suffered the worst ending of all?\n\nOleg Burov\n\nAfter leaving the KGB and starting a family, Oleg got sucked back to America and into Philip and Elizabeth\u2019s lives. He wanted to help his country reform; he ended up getting arrested by the Americans. He didn\u2019t pass along Philip\u2019s warning about the Center\u2019s plot against Gorbachev, and now he faces a lifetime in jail because the KGB won\u2019t trade him out. Sure, it might be something of achievement that Oleg is still alive \u2014 even actor Costa Ronin is surprised about that \u2014 but it\u2019s all the more disheartening to think that his life got worse the more he tried to be better. Oleg risked his happy life for the sake of principle, and that severed him from his family forever. As if that\u2019s not tragic enough, his loved ones are surely targets of the KGB because of his actions. Now he\u2019s a man without a country, all because he decided to stand up for something. That\u2019s one of the most grim things that can happen to a character, and an reminder of how cruel The Americans believes the universe can be. \u2014Jackson McHenry\n\nHenry Jennings\n\nImagine if the last thing you ever said to your parents was, \u201cI\u2019ve really gotta split, we\u2019re in the middle of a ping-pong tournament.\u201d That\u2019s the story of Henry Jennings, whose world comes crumbling down when Uncle Stan interrupts hockey practice to reveal that everything he thought he knew about his family and his life is a lie. Even worse, his parents have abandoned him. Of course, we know Philip and Elizabeth did it for his benefit \u2014 but Henry doesn\u2019t, not really. Unlike Paige, he was never even given a choice. Sure, he seems poised for nominal success, what with his exclusive New Hampshire boarding school (if Stan agrees to pay his tuition, that is) and an elite social network full of future MBAs. But all the business degrees in the world won\u2019t be able to fill the hole inside his heart. I hope he won that ping-pong tournament. \u2014Ray Rahman\n\nPaige Jennings\n\nFor my money, Paige is the one who has it the worst. She signed onto her parents\u2019 Soviet ideology because she wanted to make the world a better place, but until this finale, she never fully understood the emotional costs of their job. She sees the consequences of her father\u2019s lies come crashing down in the parking garage with Stan. She watches her parents make the choice to abandon her brother. She listens to her parents say good-bye to her brother without actually saying good-bye. And then she makes the incredibly brave choice to leave them.\n\nAfter the end of the series, Henry will feel terribly betrayed, but he\u2019ll be exonerated of any involvement and he\u2019ll have Stan. Elizabeth and Philip will have lost their family, but they\u2019ll still have each other (and the knowledge that stopped the people trying to take down Gorbachev). Stan will quietly suffer the worst failure of his career, but at least he\u2019ll get to take care of Henry. But Paige? She has nothing left. She can\u2019t reconnect with Henry. She\u2019s doomed to live in fear that the FBI will come after her. She was groomed to spy for a nation that\u2019s about to collapse. Does she have any money? Where is her real passport? Her driver\u2019s license? How will she get a job? Paige will be stuck forever in that sad, abandoned apartment, drinking vodka alone. \u2014Kathryn VanArendonk\n\nStan Beeman\n\n\u201cYou were my best friend.\u201d One of the images that will stay with me from The Americans finale is Noah Emmerich\u2019s crestfallen look when everything Stan suspected is actually proven true in that parking garage. (If only he had followed his gut back in the pilot!) The Americans was masterful at mixing dread, regret, and confusion, and Stan totally embodied those feelings in that moment. Like every relationship on the show, his friendship with Philip was built on truth and untruth: In some ways, Philip could be more himself with Stan even as he lied to him every day, which is what makes Philip\u2019s reply \u2014 \u201cYou were mine, too\u201d \u2014 that much more devastating. And then, for the final twist of the knife, Philip airs his suspicions that he thinks Renee, the woman Stan has fallen in love with, might also be a Soviet spy. Poor, poor Stan. \u2014E. Alex Jung\n\nElizabeth Jennings\n\nThe part in the finale where my sobs turned into wails was when Paige dumped her parents on the train tracks, followed by the slow, sinking realization that Philip and Elizabeth will likely never see their kids again. It\u2019s a sad situation for both the parents and children, but ultimately, it\u2019s more heartbreaking to watch a parent lose a child than vice versa. Of the two parents, Elizabeth strikes me as the more tragic figure, partly because she\u2019s been the most tragic figure all season long. Philip has spent years working on himself, and now that he\u2019s escaped, he can take off his mask once and for all (and perhaps, finally, fully self-actualize). Elizabeth, meanwhile, lost not only her children, but a huge part of her identity as a spy, all in rapid succession. She\u2019s going through an enormous amount of trauma, and the worst part is she has to figure out who she is now. \u2014Gazelle Emami\n\nPhilip Jennings\n\nI spent the majority of this season mourning the life Philip could have had \u2014 a life as a hardworking, unassuming D.C.-area hockey dad/travel agent/line-dance club regular \u2014 and how it was cut short when he got roped back into the family spy business. (Seriously, name the happiest you have ever seen Philip Jennings in the entirety of this series. It was line-dancing, wasn\u2019t it?) That\u2019s why, in my mind, there\u2019s no conclusion more devastating than that of Philip, who abruptly loses both of his kids, his best friend, and ends up exiled in a country he only vaguely recognizes anymore, all because he served a cause he barely believed in in the first place. \u2014Ashley Fetters\n\nEverybody\n\nEverybody gets a sad ending, because this is The Americans. Elizabeth and Philip must go home to a country that hasn\u2019t been a part of their lives for decades, and live there without their children, the only pure thing in their dire, violent, ideologically driven existence. Paige and Henry have to start over as, essentially, orphans, abandoned by their mother and father, supposedly for their own good. Stan ends the story positioned as a surrogate father to an abandoned teenage boy, which might sound like a note of redemption if he didn\u2019t also have to live with the guilt from betraying his sworn duty as an FBI agent, and the gnawing worry that his wife is a spy, too. Even the Soviet Union and the United States face their own sad endings: The USSR will break up within four years and reconstitute itself as a kleptocracy, while the triumphalist U.S. will declare \u201cthe end of history\u201d before devolving into quasi-fascist squabbling brought on, some say, by Russian meddling in the 2016 elections. The only thing that keeps this finale from being one of the most depressing in television history is the sheer appropriateness of everything that happens in it. \u2014Matt Zoller Seitz\n\nThe Americans: In Memoriam"}

For me, I have to do it right after I wake up! It gets my day started and helps me to stay motivated for the rest of the day. I typically work out six days a week and give myself Sundays off to rest and recover. I incline walk/run on the treadmill for 40 minutes and then walk the stair master on level 10 for another 10 minutes. My body needs cardio, so I try to sweat as much as possible. After my cardio, I do three sets of 20 push-ups and then 100 crunches on a medicine ball. I don\u2019t like to use weights (I use my own body weight instead) because I don\u2019t want to bulk!

Once I finally realized that was my vice, I completely cut it out for 30 days to try and clean myself of all processed sugar. After that I slowly incorporated moderate amounts of sugar into my everyday lifestyle. I will definitely treat myself to a sweet treat or dessert, but I am aware that excessive amounts of it are not good for my body. I don\u2019t drink coffee or mounds of caffeine. I\u2019ve learned that my body needs to sip on something throughout the day and I\u2019ve found kombucha is my life saver\u2014it's insanely loaded with probiotics and benefits for my body.

It\u2019s hard not to judge yourself if you don\u2019t see results immediately. It\u2019s a process, but a process that is worth the wait.\"\n\nA post shared by Jenna Johnson (@dance10jenna) on Oct 5, 2017 at 6:06pm PDT\n\n\n\nBe conscious of what you eat.\n\n\"I am very conscious of my diet. I am definitely NOT perfect with my nutrition, but I strive to be aware of what I put in my body. For a long time, I would avoiding eating all day and then end up binge eating treats and sugar at night, which is basically the worst thing you can do to your body. This is a period where I ended up gaining a lot of weight. I was completely punishing my body throughout the day by not giving it enough nutrients and substance, and it backfired. This also affected my mental health and made me super depressed and upset with myself. When I hit my most unhealthy point, I reached out to some nutritionists and they helped me balance out a more realistic and healthy diet.\n\nI try to stick to REAL food. What I mean by REAL food is anything that has been grown and not majorly processed. Meats, vegetables (lots of greens), less sugary fruits, good starches and nuts. Believe me, any time chocolate is in a 50-foot radius, I am the first one to grab a piece and eat it! But now I eat everything in moderation, and when I deserve a sweet treat, I allow myself to have it. It\u2019s amazing how when you feel healthy from the inside out, you show it! Once I started getting back on track with my eating routine, everything else started to fall into place!

{"label": true, "txt": "\"Just remember kid... it's all BS.\" - Robert Mitchum to Nick Nolte at the Academy Awards\n\n\n\nI live out here in Hollywood and have had my share of celebrities and their situational ethics and pretentious beliefs. Not all of them, but many at the end of the day, they believe in one thing: Themselves and nothing else or no one else.\n\n\n\nYears ago, Hollywood jumped on the Joseph Campbell bandwagon, especially screenwriters, because Campbell mentioned Star Wars and the cottage industry screenwriting gurus incorporated \"Hero's Journey...\" blah, blah, blah and other Joe Campbell lingo into all of their teachings. Robert Mitchum's quote applies.\n\n\n\nThank God! I discovered Joseph Campbell before I truly discovered Hollywood.\n\n\n\nKen Baker weaves an interesting spiritual quest for answers, antithetic to Bill Maher.\n\nHis catalyst, which is relatable to most of us, is losing his religion in a hedonistic place like Tinseltown. NBA player Lamar Odom's road to excess is the jumping off point, or \"leap of faith\" that Ken must perform a deep high-dive into his soul. He goes on to tell a stereotypical Catholic upbringing where the family of five attends church and the father goes through the motions to placate the mother, but never honestly embraces God...\n\nAn amazing spiritual story evolves from this tragedy.\n\n\n\nKen Baker's an excellent writer and entertaining to read. I burned through his book and enjoyed the spiritual quest alongside him as a reader. As a senior correspondent for E! his job \"is to report on the gamut of entertainment news...\", \" ...as well as the daily hookups, breakups, and screw-ups of the world's biggest stars.\" Who better qualified? I ask. You will actually learn something from Ken's book, and it might even contradict what you think about some of the celebrities he interviewed. If you've seen\n\nThomas Peter \"Tom\" Shadyac's \"I Am\" documentary or most recently Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath, then one could view Hollywood as a spiritual sinkhole.\n\n\n\nKey takeaway is: Don't discover God on your deathbed. If you chose not to have faith, or find religion a fairly tale, Hey, \"whatever gets you through the night,\" as John Lennon once wrote. Maybe God is George Burns to some people in Hollywood. However, for me, I am personally comfortable with Camus' logic that:\n\n\n\n\"I would rather live my life as if there is a God and die to find out there isn't, than live as if there isn't and to die to find out that there is.\""}

{"label": true, "txt": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\n/ Updated By Meredith Mandell, Adam Reiss and Daniella Silva\n\nNORRISTOWN, Pa. \u2014 The fate of Bill Cosby was now once again in the hands of a jury after the dramatic retrial at which the comedian was accused of sexual assault by a half-dozen women.\n\nThe jury, which began deliberating Wednesday morning, will decide whether Cosby, 80, is guilty of three counts of aggravated assault against one woman, Andrea Constand, 45, who claims the comedian drugged and sexually assaulted her in his home in January 2004.\n\nDeliberations are to resume Thursday morning. Cosby made no comment as he and his lawyers left court about 9:45 p.m.\n\nAndrew Wyatt, who has served as Cosby's spokesman throughout the trial, told reporters Wednesday night that the lack of a quick verdict led him to believe that jurors \"will find Mr. Cosby not guilty on all charges.\"\n\n\"What we are seeing and what we are appreciating is the fair impartiality that they are showing,\" Wyatt said.\n\nDefense attorneys portrayed Constand as lying about the sexual encounter, which Cosby has claimed was consensual, and jurors returned to the courtroom early Wednesday afternoon to ask, \"What is the legal definition of consent?\"\n\nMontgomery County Common Pleas Judge Steven O'Neill said that he couldn't give them a legal definition and that they would have to answer that question on their own, using their \"common sense.\"\n\nIn this trial, unlike in the first, prosecutors were allowed to call five more accusers in addition to Constand. Prosecutors said that Cosby preyed on Constand and that all the women who testified against him had \"strikingly similar stories.\"\n\nO'Neill issued specific instructions regarding the five additional accusers who testified. He told the jurors that they could only use the evidence for a limited purpose \u2014 to show a common plan, scheme or design or to demonstrate that the defendant didn't make a mistake.\n\nHe said the jury couldn't conclude from the five additional accusers that Cosby has \"bad character or criminal tendencies.\"\n\nHe also gave the jury specific instructions about the testimony of prosecution witness Chelan Lasha, one of the five additional accusers. Defense attorneys attacked her testimony by pointing out that she has a prior conviction for making false statements to police. O'Neill told jurors that they could consider her conviction in deciding whether to believe all or part of her testimony.\n\nThe judge also instructed the jury that Constand's testimony alone is enough to convict Cosby.\n\n\"It does not need the support of other evidence,\" he said. He also told the jury that it could convict Cosby based on circumstantial evidence and that it didn't need to determine a specific motive to reach a guilty verdict.\n\nCosby, sitting next to his defense team, appeared solemn as the judge read the charges.\n\nIn two hours of closing arguments, Cosby's defense team painted Constand as a \"con artist\" and a \"pathological liar\" seeking fame and fortune and willing to blackmail Cosby in pursuit of those goals.\n\nDefense attorney Kathleen Bliss suggested that Constand and the other women who testified \"were motivated by a common movement, many of them represented by the same attorney,\" she said, referring to Gloria Allred and her daughter, Lisa Bloom, who is also a lawyer. Bliss emphasized a proposal from Allred for a $100 million settlement fund in 2014.\n\nTom Mesereau, Cosby's lead attorney, told the jury that the case was about a \"blind 80-year-old man with a successful career facing absolute ruin.\"\n\nMesereau walked the jury through a PowerPoint presentation, pointing to what he characterized as 12 inconsistent statements about the nature of Constand's relationship with Cosby, including whether they had flirted before the alleged assault, whether they were ever alone together and whether she had been in bed with him. He said her statements were not simply \"inconsistencies ... they are lies.\"\n\n\"This woman will say anything. She will absolutely say anything. She's a pathological liar,\" he added.\n\nBliss also questioned the prosecution's decision to bring in witnesses to testify that Cosby assaulted them more than 30 years ago.\n\n\"How unfair is that \u2014 digging up stuff from three decades ago?\" she asked. She also told the jurors that they shouldn't allow the #MeToo movement, which has exposed scores of men in the media, entertainment and business worlds as sexual harassers, to sway their decision.\n\n\"Don't get me wrong \u2014 bad things definitely happen. But, ladies and gentleman, not every accusation is true. Your common sense tells you that,\" Bliss said. \"We do have to deal with sexual assault. It's a worldwide problem, just like we do with sexual harassment, pay disparity, social inequality.\n\n\"But questioning an accuser is not shaming them,\" she added.\n\nBut Assistant Montgomery County District Attorney Kristen Feden told jurors that it was Cosby, not Constand, who was the con artist and that the women who testified against him had \"all strikingly similar stories.\"\n\n\"He preyed on Andrea Constand the same way he preyed on all those five women,\" she said.\n\nShe prosecutor also lambasted Bliss for \"character assassination\" of the accusers.\n\n\"That character assassination that Ms. Bliss put those women through was utterly shameful,\" she said. \"She's the exact reason why women, victims of sexual assault and men don't report these crimes.\"\n\nWhile there have been dozens of sexual misconduct allegations against Cosby, the Constand case is the only complaint that has resulted in criminal charges. Cosby has repeatedly denied all allegations of sexual misconduct, which have ranged from groping to sexual assault to rape, with many of the accusers claiming that he drugged them.\n\nCosby's first trial last year ended in a deadlocked jury, so his retrial has become the first big celebrity court case since the #MeToo movement emerged. In the first trial, the jury deliberated for 52 hours and failed to reach a verdict, resulting in a mistrial.\n\nCosby declined to testify at both trials. If convicted, he could face a maximum sentence of 10 years and a fine of up to $25,000 on each count.\n\nMeredith Mandell and Adam Reiss reported from Norristown. Daniella Silva reported from New York."}

{"label": true, "txt": "We are one week away from the end of the world. Well, the AHS world that is.\n\nOn September 12, American Horror Story: Apocalypse will premiere on FX and if the trailer is any indication the fallout will have near-biblical proportions.\n\nWe already know the AHS universe has a guaranteed 10 seasons, but with only seven days until the Apocalypse premiere... we can't get too ahead of ourselves. So let's try theorizing with what we've got.\n\nHere's everything we do and don't know about the impending doom of Apocalypse.\n\n\n\nThe end of the world hits October 2019 (and other timeline details)\n\nBack in April, creator Ryan Murphy teased Season 8's timeframe during an Emmy FYC panel saying it took place \"18 months from today.\" That puts our apocalyptic end sometime during October of next year. (Yes, this contradicts Murphy's earlier statement that Apocalypse would take place 10 to 20 years in the future.)\n\nSeason 8's first episode is fittingly titled \"The End,\" meaning our story, in the words of EP Alexis Martin, \"begins with the end of the world and then our world begins.\" That being said, AHS will likely explore the lead-up to the disaster as well.\n\nSeriously, flashbacks are almost as big an AHS staple as surprising sex scenes.\n\n\n\n\n\nSeason 8 is the long awaited Murder House/Coven crossover\n\nThe promise of the Harmons and the witches of Miss Robichaux's Academy pairing up for a season of chaos has been rumored for awhile... but Murphy didn't officially confirm the connection until June.\n\nThe Coven/Murder House AHS crossover season won't be happening next year...because it's happening THIS YEAR. AHS #8 WITCHES RULE THIS SEPTEMBER \u2014 Ryan Murphy (@MrRPMurphy) June 14, 2018\n\nSince then, Murphy has posted shots of the Murder House and Coven casts on familiar sets. Viviene and Ben Harmon are seen here in what looks a lot like the Los Angeles Murder House.\n\nConnie, Sarah and Dylan. The Harmon\u2019s are scaring up drama at The Murder House with Director Supreme Paulson. pic.twitter.com/L6e9N3LTtY \u2014 Ryan Murphy (@MrRPMurphy) August 25, 2018\n\nAnd here we've got the coven posing on a mod-staircase fit for their New Orleans home.\n\nThe Coven Returns. What a thrilling night with the legend Stevie Nicks on the set of AHS. pic.twitter.com/wsI1FlfN1W \u2014 Ryan Murphy (@MrRPMurphy) August 19, 2018\n\nIt's unclear how AHS plans to bring these geographically different stories into the same arena. Personally, I'm hoping for a Zombieland style, post-apocalyptic search for Twinkies, but that may not be possible given the radiation levels...\n\nThat evil baby/Antichrist from Murder House is back\n\nThat explains all the scary fetus promos.\n\nExcited to announce Cody Fern will be playing the role of Michael Langdon in American Horror Story: Apocalypse. Premieres September 12 on FX. pic.twitter.com/kFYQ2GAncd \u2014 Ryan Murphy (@MrRPMurphy) July 26, 2018\n\nIn July, Murphy announced that American Crime Story alumnus Cody Fern would be assuming the role of grown-up Michael Langdon \u2014 son of Viviene Harmon and Tate Langdon. Which is great news considering Fern's evident acting chops... but also presents a confusing timeline.\n\nIf Apocalypse is set in 2019 and Michael was born in 2012, then this little Beelzebub baby is growing up super fast. Or we're looking at a dash of demonic 13 Going on 30.\n\nWe got our first glimpse of the age-defying world-ender in AHS's first teaser trailer and he looked a lot like Edward Mordrake of Freak Show. I would say it was just a coincidence, but... is anything in AHS ever a coincidence?\n\nJessica Lange, Kathy Bates, and Stevie Nicks (among others) will return\n\nGuess who's coming back for AHS APOCALYPSE? Taissa Farmiga, Gabourey Sidibe, Lily Rabe, Frances Conroy and....Stevie Nicks. So thrilled the family is together again! #AHSApocalypse \u2014 Ryan Murphy (@MrRPMurphy) August 7, 2018\n\nSadly, powerhouse Angela Bassett won't be returning for this season of American Horror Story. However, the equally legendary Kathy Bates and Stevie Nicks will make appearances.\n\nThe long awaited return of early series star Jessica Lange as Murder House's Constance Langdon has also been confirmed.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough (c'mon, I'd pay anything to see that three-woman show), plenty of other series' alumni \u2014 including Evan Peters, Sarah Paulson, Emma Roberts, Adina Porter, Billie Lourd, Cheyenne Jackson, Lily Rabe, Frances Conroy, Connie Britton, Billy Eichner and many, many more \u2014 will return for Season 8.\n\nYes, even Rubber Man... in whatever form that takes.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome actors will be doubling-up\n\nNo, not in a Bette and Dot kinda way\u2014though Sarah Paulson will be plenty busy. Given the collision of anthologies set to unfold, a number of performers will reprise old roles as well as new ones.\n\nSarah Paulson is set to portray the still Supreme Cordelia Foxx of Coven and Craigslist medium Billie Dean Howard of Murder House\u2014alongside her new Apocalypse character, Venable, first introduced through the clip below.\n\nEvan Peters will similarly bring back the weirdly hunky Tate of Murder House and venture into new territory with an Apocalypse original character Murphy said was a \"comedic hairstylist.\"\n\nTaissa Farmiga, also a Coven and Murder House veteran, will rock both her roles as Zoe Benson and Violet Harmon. I'm not sure how much the young witch can do for us in the end of days, but I'm pretty stoked the Antichrist's half-sister is around... something tells me we're gonna need her thoughts.\n\nOther crossover castings are possible, but not yet confirmed.\n\nJoan Collins is joining the cast\n\nIf this isn't resonating with you as a big deal, that's okay. Take a mere 200-ish hours to watch all of the 1980's soap opera Dynasty. Don't worry, I will wait for you. This is important.\n\nAll done? Perfect. Joan Collins is (as you now know) a delightful, devilish legend. Her addition to the AHS universe is a gift and we need to treat it as such.\n\nOutside of Collins playing Evan Peters' grandmother, very little is known about her role.\n\nHowever, we do know how she got it. Turns out Collins met Ryan Murphy at the Vanity Fair Oscar party, mentioned the show, and two weeks later got an offer. Could this woman and her career be anymore supremely glamorous? (Get it? Supreme? Seriously, there is no way this woman is not a coven leader... right?)\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Billy Porter\n\nYep. The Pose icon is shuffling over to the dark and twisted parts of the Murphy-verse.\n\nVery little is know about Porter's character, though set photos imply he is Coven related.\n\n\"All I can say is dreams do come true,\" Porter said of the opportunity. \"They may not come when you want them, but it\u2019s all right on time. Keep on fighting, keep on showing up for your life. Keep on pushing. I\u2019m a living witness that dreams come true. You change the world when you change your mind, and we all can make a difference in this world.\"\n\nThe glamor is gonna get weird\n\nWith Evan Peters and Joan Collins' stylish castings plus the fabulous gowns in the trailer taken into account, the gorey but glamorous promos AHS has been rolling out make a bit more sense.\n\nThis \"haircut\" clip is almost as chic as the new dark, pixie Kathy Bates is rocking for her role as Ms. Meade.\n\nAnd the whole sucking the life out of someone feels very Fiona Goode of Coven.\n\nOverall, we can probably expect more of the sleek style and finesse we saw in Coven\u2014even if it's the end of the world. (Rapture or no rapture, that dark lipstick on Sarah Paulson could kill anyone. Goodness gracious.)\n\nExpect something crazy to go down in Episode 5\n\nWhat could be more intense than the apparent nuclear apocalypse of the trailer? Personally, I don't know, but there is allegedly a \"huge thing that happens in Episode 5.\" In a conversation with Entertainment Weekly, Murphy alluded to the big midseason development, calling it the season's \"hook.\"\n\nNotably, Episode 6 has a Murder House-heavy cast lined up with Sarah Paulson in the director's chair. Not sure what that means for the preceding episode, but we could be looking at a flashback.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Hail, Satan.\"\n\nOkay, so you heard Kathy Bates say that at the end of the trailer too?\n\nClearly, the Satanic overtones of Apocalypse are not going to be subtle, Sarah Paulson is going to be far from sweet, and that bunker is going to be Hell on Earth.\n\nDo we have a 10 Cloverfield Lane situation on our hands? A Handmaid's Tale situation on our hands? Just tell me. What do we have on our hands?!\n\nLooks like only time will tell. One more week, horror fans.\n\nAmerican Horror Story: Apocalypse premieres Wednesday, September 12 at 9pm on FX."}
{"label": true, "txt": "Dakota Louis Meyer (born June 26, 1988)[1] is a United States Marine. A veteran of the War in Afghanistan, he was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Battle of Ganjgal on 8 September 2009, in Kunar Province, Afghanistan. Meyer is the second-youngest living Medal of Honor recipient, the third living recipient for either the Iraq War or the War in Afghanistan[2] and the first living U.S. Marine in 38 years to be so honored.[3]\n\nEarly life and education [ edit ]\n\nMeyer was born and raised in Columbia, Kentucky, the son of Felicia \"Killy\" Gilliam and Michael Meyers.[4][5] In 2006, after graduation from Green County High School, he enlisted in the Marine Corps at a recruiting station in Louisville, Kentucky and completed basic training at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island.[4]\n\nMilitary service [ edit ]\n\nMeyer deployed to Fallujah, Iraq in 2007 as a scout sniper with 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines. He gained national attention for his actions in Afghanistan during his second deployment in Kunar Province with Embedded Training Team 2-8.[6][7]\n\nOn 8 September 2009, near the village of Ganjgal, Meyer learned that three Marines and a Navy corpsman, who were members of Meyer's squad and his friends, were missing after being ambushed by a group of insurgents. Under enemy fire, Meyer entered an area known to be inhabited by insurgents and eventually found the four missing servicemen dead and stripped of their weapons, body armor and radios. There he saw a Taliban fighter trying to take the bodies. The fighter tackled Meyer, and after a brief scuffle, Meyer grabbed a baseball-sized rock and beat the fighter to death.[8] With the help of Afghan soldiers, he moved the bodies to a safer area where they could be extracted.[9] During his search, Meyer \"personally evacuated 12 friendly wounded and provided cover for another 24 Marines and soldiers to escape likely death at the hands of a numerically superior and determined foe.\"\n\nFour U.S. servicemen died in the ambush:\n\n1st Lt. Michael Johnson, 25, of Virginia Beach, Virginia\n\nStaff Sgt. Aaron Kenefick, 30, of Roswell, Georgia\n\nGunnery Sgt. Edwin Wayne Johnson Jr., 31, of Columbus, Georgia\n\nHospital Corpsman Third Class James R. Layton, 22, of Riverbank, California.\n\nA fifth man, Army Sgt. 1st Class Kenneth W. Westbrook, 41, of Shiprock, New Mexico, later died from his wounds.[10]\n\nMeyer stands at attention after receiving the Medal of Honor from U.S. President Barack Obama during the Medal of Honor presentation ceremony in the East Room of the White House , Washington, D.C., 15 September 2011.\n\nOn 6 November 2010, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, General James Amos, told reporters during a visit to Camp Pendleton, California that a living U.S. Marine had been nominated for the Medal of Honor. Two days later, Marine Corps Times, an independent newspaper covering Marine Corps operations, reported that the unnamed person was Meyer, citing anonymous sources. CNN confirmed the story independently two days later.[11]\n\nOn 9 June 2011, the Marine Corps announced that two other Marines on Meyer's team in Ganjgal would receive the Navy Cross, the second-highest award for valor a Marine can receive. Capt. Ademola D. Fabayo and Staff Sgt. Juan J. Rodriguez-Chavez were recognized for their roles in retrieving the bodies of the fallen Marines and corpsman. Before Meyer began searching for the missing servicemen on foot, Rodriguez-Chavez drove a gun truck into the kill zone with Fabayo manning the truck's machine gun.[12]\n\nWhen President Barack Obama's staff called Meyer to set up a time for the president to inform him that his case for the Medal of Honor had been approved, they were told Meyer was working at his construction job and were asked to call again during his lunch break.[13]\n\nMeyer was awarded the Medal of Honor in a ceremony on 15 September 2011.[14] When a White House staffer contacted Meyer to arrange the ceremony, Meyer asked if he could have a beer with the president.[15] He received an invitation to the White House for the afternoon before the ceremony. Meyer also requested that when he was honored, simultaneous commemorative services should be held at other associated locations to honor the memory of his colleagues who died or were mortally wounded during the ambush and his rescue attempts.[16]\n\nCivilian [ edit ]\n\nA year after the Battle of Ganjgal, after drinking at a friend's house, Meyer attempted to commit suicide using a Glock pistol kept in his truck's glove compartment. The gun was not loaded. Meyer later sought help for post-traumatic stress disorder.[17]\n\nIn September 2011, Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear bestowed upon Meyer the honorary title of Kentucky Colonel during an event in his hometown of Greensburg in which Meyer served as grand marshal.[18]\n\nMeyer filed a lawsuit against his former employer, defense contractor BAE Systems, alleging the company and his supervisor punished him for his opposition to a weapons sale to Pakistan.[19] The lawsuit claimed that BAE Systems ridiculed Meyer's Medal of Honor, called him mentally unstable and suggested he had a drinking problem, thereby costing him a job.[20] On 15 December 2011, BAE announced that the parties resolved their dispute out of court.[21]\n\nOn 14 December 2011, McClatchy news outlets published an article which questioned the actual number of lives Meyer saved. The article stated that \"crucial parts that the Marine Corps publicized were untrue, unsubstantiated or exaggerated,\" but that Meyer \"by all accounts deserved his nomination.\"[22]\n\nMeyer and Bing West wrote the book Into the Fire: A Firsthand Account of the Most Extraordinary Battle in the Afghan War, about the Battle of Ganjgal. It was published on 25 September 2012.[23] In the book, Meyer makes a case for Army Captain William D. Swenson to be awarded the Medal of Honor;[17] Swenson had criticized Army officers at the nearby Forward Operating Base Joyce for not providing fire support, the resulting political fallout not conducive to awarding him the medal. Those same officers were later cited following a military investigation for \"negligent\" leadership leading \"directly to the loss of life\" on the battlefield.[24][dead link] Swenson was awarded the Medal of Honor on 15 October 2013.[25]\n\nIn 2013, Meyer participated in the fourth season of Maximum Warrior,[26] a TV competition among U.S.-military operators, featuring 10 military-inspired challenges. Meyer, eliminated on the eighth episode, \"Night Hostage Rescue\", airing 26 November 2013, finished in fourth place. As of 2015, Meyer sits on the advisory board for VETPAW,[27] an organization of U.S. military veterans dedicated to protecting African wildlife.\n\nMeyer is a proponent of legalizing the medical use of cannabis, which he says can help veterans suffering from PTSD while also reducing usage of opioid drugs.[28] In March 2018, Meyer co-authored an op-ed calling for medical cannabis to be legalized in Kentucky.[29]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nOn March 13, 2015, Meyer became engaged to Bristol Palin, daughter of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin.[30] On 18 May 2015, Sarah and Bristol Palin announced that the wedding, originally scheduled for May 23, 2015, had been called off.[31] On June 25, 2015, Bristol Palin announced that she was pregnant for a second time.[32] She gave birth to daughter, Sailor Grace, on December 23, 2015.[33] On 6 January 2016, People reported that Meyer is the biological father of the child, and that Meyer had filed legal documents asking for joint legal and physical custody of the newborn as well as child support from Palin.[34] In March 2016, an interim joint legal and physical custody agreement was reached between Palin and Meyer.[35] On 23 May 2016, Palin and Meyer were married.[36] In December 2016, Palin announced that she was expecting her third child, the second with Meyer.[37] On May 8, 2017, she gave birth to a daughter they named Atlee Bay.[38] On January 29, 2018, Meyer filed for divorce from Palin, citing a \"conflict of personalities\".[39] On August 1, 2018, Palin confirmed that her divorce from Meyer was finalized.[40]\n\nBooks [ edit ]\n\nInto the Fire: A Firsthand Account of the Most Extraordinary Battle in the Afghan War[23]\n\nHonors and awards [ edit ]\n\nMilitary awards [ edit ]\n\nMedal of Honor citation [ edit ]\n\n\"The President of the United States in the name of The Congress takes pleasure in presenting the MEDAL OF HONOR to\n\nCORPORAL DAKOTA L. MEYER\n\nUNITED STATES MARINE CORPS\n\n\n\nFor service as set forth in the following:\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while serving with Marine Embedded Training Team 2-8, Regional Corps Advisory Command 3-7, in Kunar Province, Afghanistan, on 8 September 2009. Corporal Meyer maintained security at a patrol rally point while other members of his team moved on foot with two platoons of Afghan National Army and Border Police into the village of Ganjgal for a pre-dawn meeting with village elders. Moving into the village, the patrol was ambushed by more than 50 enemy fighters firing rocket propelled grenades, mortars, and machine guns from houses and fortified positions on the slopes above. Hearing over the radio that four U.S. team members were cut off, Corporal Meyer seized the initiative. With a fellow Marine driving, Corporal Meyer took the exposed gunner's position in a gun-truck as they drove down the steeply terraced terrain in a daring attempt to disrupt the enemy attack and locate the trapped U.S. team. Disregarding intense enemy fire now concentrated on their lone vehicle, Corporal Meyer killed a number of enemy fighters with the mounted machine guns and his rifle, some at near point blank range, as he and his driver made three solo trips into the ambush area. During the first two trips, he and his driver evacuated two dozen Afghan soldiers, many of whom were wounded. When one machine gun became inoperable, he directed a return to the rally point to switch to another gun-truck for a third trip into the ambush area where his accurate fire directly supported the remaining U.S. personnel and Afghan soldiers fighting their way out of the ambush. Despite a shrapnel wound to his arm, Corporal Meyer made two more trips into the ambush area in a third gun-truck accompanied by four other Afghan vehicles to recover more wounded Afghan soldiers and search for the missing U.S. team members. Still under heavy enemy fire, he dismounted the vehicle on the fifth trip and moved on foot to locate and recover the bodies of his team members. Meyer's daring initiative and bold fighting spirit throughout the 6-hour battle significantly disrupted the enemy's attack and inspired the members of the combined force to fight on. His unwavering courage and steadfast devotion to his U.S. and Afghan comrades in the face of almost certain death reflected great credit upon himself and upheld the highest traditions of the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.\"[41]\n\nSee also [ edit ]"}

{"label": true, "txt": "Meghan Markle is set to marry Prince Harry on May 19, 2018. Life as she knows it will forever change from that day forward. Although, since announcing their engagement, life has already changed plenty for the humanitarian and (former) actress. Between her first royal engagement with Harry and spending Christmas with the royal family,Meghan has had to make some significant adjustments to her life and the way she interacts with the public.\n\nBelow, in no particular order, a list of things Meghan probably won\u2019t be doing once she officially becomes a Duchess.\n\n1. Take selfies.\n\nMeghan has already mastered this rule.During her first official event with Prince Harry in early December, Meghan reportedly told a couple who asked for a selfie, \u201cWe\u2019re not allowed to do selfies.\u201d\n\nMeghan is learning the royal ropes already, telling one couple who asked for a selfie in Nottingham today: \u201cWe\u2019re not allowed to do selfies.\u201d \u2014 Victoria Murphy (@QueenVicMirror) December 1, 2017\n\nMeghan also probably won\u2019t be allowed to use any social media filters (like the puppy one from Snapchat, above) in public, and she can also say goodbye to posing with pretty drinks, unless it\u2019s for an official royal appearance.\n\nOn top of all this, Queen Elizabeth allegedly isn\u2019t a fan of the selfie. In 2014, U.S. ambassador Matthew Barzun told Tatler magazine that The Queen confided in him and revealed that selfies were \u201cdisconcerting\u201d and \u201cstrange\u201d to her. To put it another way, \u201cShe was essentially saying: \u2018I miss eye contact,\u2019\u201d Barzun said. (via Hello!)\n\nRelated article: The Greatest Royal Family Moments To Relive From 2017\n\n2. Go out in public totally alone.\n\nSummer-summer-summertiiiiiime\u2026 \u2600\ufe0f A post shared by Meghan Markle (@meghanmarkle) on May 28, 2016 at 11:11am PDT\n\nHave you ever seen the Duchess of Cambridge all by herself? Like every member of the royal family, Meghan will likely have security with her everywhere she goes.\n\n3. Give autographs.\n\nSave for official signings at royal engagements, members of the royal family are not allowed to sign autographs for the public.The fear is that someone could forge the signature and use it against the family. In 2010, Prince Charles broke this protocol when he granted an autograph to one of the victims of the Cornwall floods. According to The Telegraph, he wrote, \u201cCharles 2010\u201d and apologized for his \u201cshaky writing.\u201d\n\n4. Use social media.\n\nMeghan will likely join Harry, Kate, and Will under @KensingtonRoyal on social media. The trio have been providing updates about the charities they support on the account, which has provided an intimate but controlled line of communication between the young royals and the public. @KensingtonRoyal is where Meghan and Harry released their official engagement photos in December and also where they announced their wedding date.\n\n5. Show PDA.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason photos of Kate and Will kissing are limited to their wedding day smooch on the balcony at Buckingham Palace. Does this mean that Meghan and Harry\u2019s engagement photos will be the last time we see them get up close and personal? According to royal etiquette expert Myka Meier (via People), there is no official protocol against PDA, despite Meghan and Harry\u2019s predecessors keeping things to a minimum. (Recall Kate and Will\u2019s hug fest during the 2010 Olympics in London.) Says Meier, \u201cMeghan and Prince Harry holding hands at a royal engagement is a refreshingly modern approach to their new role both as a couple and as representative of the royal family.\u201d FYI, Kate and Will held hands during their Christmas morning walk to church in December 2017, while Meghan held onto Harry\u2019s arm. But that\u2019s probably all we\u2019ll get moving forward.\n\nRelated article: How Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Will Make A Living After The Wedding\n\n6. Vote.\n\nMeghan, who will seek British citizenship after her marriage to Harry, will likely not participate in future UK elections. As the official parliament website states: \u201cAlthough not prohibited by law, it is considered unconstitutional for the Monarch to vote in an election,\u201d referring to Queen Elizabeth II. Beyond The Queen, the law is blurry, but a spokesperson from Buckingham Palace told Newsweek in June 2017 that members of the royal family do not exercise their voting rights \u201cby convention.\u201d\n\n7. Wear see-through outfits like the $75,000 Ralph & Russo mesh dress in Meghan\u2019s engagement photos.\n\nWhile there was no obvious cleavage or slip-up, the sheer look of the dress raised some eyebrows and will likely be the last see-through dress Meghan wears in public or in official photos. She also drew (unnecessary) attention when she stepped out without stockings the day she and Harry announced their engagement.\n\n\u201cYou never see a royal without their nude stockings,\u201d royal expert Victoria Arbiter tells Business Insider. \u201cMeghan, from what I can see from the engagement photographs, it doesn\u2019t look like she was wearing tights or stockings. I would say that\u2019s really the only hard, steadfast rule in terms of what the Queen requires.\u201d\n\n8. Wear colorful or dark nail polish.\n\nAs per royal protocol, only nails bearing natural colors are allowed at official events.According to nail polish giant Essie, Queen Elizabeth has been a customer of \u201cBallet Slippers,\u201d a very subtle light shade of pink, since 1989.\n\nRelated article: 6 Major Ways Meghan Markle Has Already Broken Royal Convention\n\n9. Wear wedges.\n\nThis rule reportedly only applies when Queen Elizabeth is present. In 2015, a source told Vanity Fair, \u201cThe Queen isn\u2019t a fan of wedged shoes. She really doesn\u2019t like them and it\u2019s well known among the women in the family.\u201d Wedge away, Meghan, just as Kate has when the Queen\u2019s not around.\n\n10. Stick her tongue out.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason tongue wagging has only been displayed by the youngest members of the family, and even those instances are rare. Though, to go with her recent string of breaking royal tradition, Meghan stuck her tongue out while walking to church on Christmas with the royal family.\n\n11. Carry giant purses.\n\nYes, it\u2019s very convenient when your giant bag can fit everything from a laptop to three days\u2019 worth of snacks. But when you\u2019re a royal, other people carry things for you, right?\n\nWhile it\u2019s unclear whether or not carrying clutches (instead of big purses) is an official royal rule, there\u2019s a really good reason why Duchess Kate and The Queen are almost always seen with clutches or bags with small handles. As one royal expert explained to The Daily Mail, \u201cThe Duchess of Cambridge may well prefer not to shake hands with certain people \u2013 but there are other ways to achieve this, as used by The Queen and other members of the royal family, than opting for a clutch over a bag with a strap.\u201d What\u2019s more: \u201cIt is protocol that you do not extend your hand to any member of the royal family\u2026 unless their hand extends first.\u201d\n\nPrincess Diana was also a fan of clutches in the \u201880s and \u201890s, but it had less to do with etiquette or protocol and more to do with practicality. She called them \u201ccleavage bags,\u201d according to designer Anya Hindmarch, whose bags were a favorite of Diana\u2019s. In 2009, Hindmarch told The Telegraph: \u201cWe used to laugh when we designed what she called her \u2018cleavage bags,\u2019 little satin clutches which she would cover her cleavage with when she stepped out of cars.\u201d"}
{"label": true, "txt": "Evan Bass and Carly Waddell's wedding, filmed during a halt in production, airs on Tuesday. The pair talk to THR about \"the absurdity of going on TV to fall in love.\"\n\nParadise is back and so is one of Bachelor Nation\u2019s favorite couples \u2014 but it didn't always look that way.\n\nBachelor in Paradise alums Evan Bass and Carly Waddell are set tie the knot on ABC Tuesday when the fourth season returns for the second half of its two-night premiere. The two chose to say \u201cI do\u201d in Mexico, returning to the beaches where they first fell in love on last year's Paradise. Chris Harrison officiated their intimate ceremony at the Vidanta Nuevo Vallarta resort near Puerto Vallarta in June.\n\nBut the state of their televised wedding hit a snag when production on the series shut down. After a June 4 sexual encounter between two castmembers who had been drinking, Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson, a producer filed a misconduct allegation and studio Warner Bros. Television suspended filming on June 11 to investigate. Filming eventually resumed two weeks later, but Bass and Waddell's nuptials took place June 17, when the fate of the season was still up in the air.\n\nBass and Waddell now tell The Hollywood Reporter that the fate of their wedding, however, was never a question.\n\n\"We were always going to get married,\" Bass tells THR of the ceremony happening amid the investigation. \"Obviously if production was shut down, then it wouldn\u2019t have aired, but the most important thing for us was to get married in Paradise.\u201d\n\nBass, 34, and Waddell, 31, met and got engaged during the summer of 2016 on the third season of Paradise. Bass, an erectile dysfunction specialist, was introduced to viewers on JoJo Fletcher's season of The Bachelorette. Waddell, a singer-songwriter on Chris Soules' season of The Bachelor, also appeared on the previous season of Paradise.\n\nNow, the couple remains one of a handful of success stories to emerge from the franchise \u2014 and they now have their first child on the way.\n\nWhen they returned to Mexico amid the summer saga, they both had to block out the production shutdown to keep their TV fairytale going. \u201cWe were sort of in that wedding glow,\u201d Bass explains. \u201cIt felt like we were in a bubble. It was all about the wedding. I think everyone was super respectful of the fact that this was our big day. It was all about us.\u201d\n\nWaddell, who wore a dress by Israeli designer Idan Cohen, shared her favorite moment: Bass\u2019 face when he first saw her walking down the aisle. \u201cHis jaw was on the floor.\u201d\n\nBass added, \u201cIt felt so full-circle. A year earlier Carly was puking a few hundred feet away from where we were getting married on our first date.\u201d The pair sealed the deal with a set of Neil Lane rings.\n\nOther Bachelor franchise alums present at the ceremony helped to ensure that the behind-the-scenes drama didn't tarnish their big day. \"Nobody wanted to bother us with stuff that would take us away from our wedding,\" Bass says. Wells Adams, who is the bartender on the current season and appeared on their cycle of Paradise, was one of Bass\u2019 groomsman and texted him during the shutdown to offer his support: \u201cWells was like, \u2018I don\u2019t care man. I\u2019m there.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe morning of their wedding, Bass published a column on THR pleading with ABC to not cancel the show. With the investigation still ongoing, WBTV and ABC were unable to offer any details on if the show would return.\n\nLooking back, Bass admitted that there was doubt in his mind that he pushed aside about whether filming on the show \u2014 and potentially the series \u2014 would ever resume. \u201cI felt through sheer willpower that I could make it come back to life,\" he now says. \"I trust everyone that\u2019s a part of the show. I felt like we knew it would come back.\"\n\nIn the wake of the season four investigation, the amount of alcohol consumed on set became a hot topic. As a result of the controversy, Paradise kept tabs on the cast's drinking when they returned to set \u2014 something Harrison will discuss with the cast, also on Tuesday's episode. Though new Paradise drinking rules were later put in place, the newlyweds said alcohol wasn't an issue during their wedding. \u201cNo one drank that much. It wasn\u2019t like a crazy affair,\u201d Bass says, while Waddell says she didn't even have time to drink at her own wedding.\n\n\"Paradise is a great parody of life,\" says Bass. \"I love the fact that it sort of illuminates the absurdity of going on TV to fall in love. It\u2019s very American. We\u2019re ridiculous, but it\u2019s awesome.\u201d\n\nAnd he still disagrees that Paradise is \"a drunk hookup show,\" something both Harrison and ABC reality chief Robert Mills echoed to THR earlier this week. \"There\u2019s sexuality on the show,\" Bass says. \"The parts that are shown are sort of the fun, wild parts, but there\u2019s so much more that happens, like the hours that we spend with a potential significant other. People don\u2019t really drink that much. The show was more about relationships and discovering yourself.\u201d\n\nWaddell adds, \u201cWe\u2019re so excited to watch the season. The show has such a dear place in our hearts.\u201d\n\nWaddell, now 13.5 weeks pregnant, says their baby is the size of a peach.

{"label": true, "txt": "Media playback is not supported on this device Biles hopes sharing abuse story will encourage others to speak out\n\nSimone Biles says it was a \"relief\" and \"empowering\" to speak out about being the victim of sexual abuse by jailed US Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar.\n\nIn January 2018 Nassar was sentenced to up to 175 years after nearly 160 women accused him of sexual abuse.\n\nBiles, 21, then told her own story of how she was one of those victims.\n\n\"It was very hard but I figured out that if I can tell my story then it might encourage other people to tell theirs,\" she said.\n\nBiles, who won four gold medals and a bronze at the Rio Olympics in 2016, said she wanted to speak out about the reaction to her revelation and her responsibility as a role model.\n\nShe came back from a two-year career break to win her fifth US national title in August while wearing a teal leotard - the designated colour to represent survivors of sexual abuse.\n\nAnd she returns to international competition at the World Championships in Qatar this month.\n\n\"I think it was very important to support the fellow gymnasts it had happened to and to speak up for what you believe in and say 'I don't think this is right' and I hope I gave them courage to come out and tell their stories one day if they want to,\" she said.\n\n\"People do look up to me so if they can see Simone can be strong enough then hopefully I can too - and that's the message I wanted to give.\n\n\"It kind of felt empowering even though I know that is an overused word right now.\"\n\nOhio-born Biles says she was \"relieved\" after speaking out, after feeling \"a lot of pressure\" to keep the truth to herself for so long.\n\nBiles praised Judge Rosemarie Aquilina who sentenced Nasser, and she says he \"got what he deserved\".\n\n\"The judge was absolutely amazing on her part, so we were very proud of her, and it is kind of a relief because [Nassar] got what he deserved and he almost got as many years [in prison] as [he abused] girls.\n\n\"It's kind of crazy because I can't be the one to save everything, but as long as I do my job and everyone is pleased maybe I'll save something.\"\n\nSimone Biles wears a teal leotard to show her solidarity for sexual abuse victims\n\nLooking beyond the World Championships in Doha, which run from 24 October to 3 November, Biles is focused on preparing for the Tokyo Olympics in 2020 and says that not being a \"rookie\" anymore means she is a mentor to the younger members of the squad - and has learnt to manage expectations.\n\n\"I pushed a lot of things away because expectations are scary and I don't want to be the one to hold all of them, but as I get older I just become used to it,\" she said.\n\n\"For my first Olympics Games to walk away with five medals is unbeatable even for myself, so we'll just go in there [Tokyo] with an open mind and see what happens.\"\n\nAnalysis\n\nBBC sports news correspondent Natalie Pirks\n\nI've been lucky enough to see Simone Biles compete before, particularly in Rio when she cemented her name in gymnastics legend. But I had never seen her perform this close up. There is no fuss with Biles. No ego, no entourage - unless you count her mum, Nellie, who tagged along for the incredibly laid-back interview.\n\nAfter an amicable split with her long-term coach she has a new coaching partnership and said recently she feels happier and healthier than ever. A lot of that she puts down to the 18-month break she took after Rio, a break where she swam with sharks, socialised like never before - and drank plenty of chocolate shakes!\n\nShe's improved on her nemesis, the bars. She reigns supreme on the vault and floor and has added improvements to the routines which won her gold in Rio, but she now has a new ambition - to make the individual bars final in Doha. Something seems to have just clicked.\n\nYet despite Biles' superhuman abilities she has always suffered with low self-esteem. As a huge Beyonce fan she recently said she wished she had the singer's confidence. She giggled with that infectious smile though when I quoted lines from Beyonce's track 'Ego' to her - \"I walk like this 'cause I can back it up.\" And boy, can she."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Meghan King Edmonds continues to stick her foot in her mouth with comments about RHOC cast by Tiffany Bailey\n\nEven Danielle Staub said it, there are no \u2018wallflowers\u2019 on Season 8 of RHONJ and that is going to make for some explosive TV.\n\nAfter the first few episode of RHONJ have aired, fans of the Bravo series have found themselves taking sides in the growing war between Siggy Flicker and Margaret Josephs. It turns out that the RHONJ cast are also taking sides and Danielle Staub making it very clear who she thinks is right and who she thinks is wrong in this latest reality TV drama.\n\nDanielle\u2019s return to Real Housewives of New Jersey as a friend of the cast has been interesting. For starters because when she left after Season 2, Danielle wasn\u2019t a friend of anybody. Don\u2019t forget that Teresa Giudice\u2019s table flipping and her \u201cprostitution whore\u201d insult both were aimed at Danielle.\n\nFor Season 8, Teresa Giudice has reconciled with Danielle Staub and somehow the two women have become great friends. I\u2019m willing to bet that their friendship has more to do with RHONJ ratings than actual friendship but there you have it.\n\nNow that Danielle is back, she\u2019s buddied up to Teresa and Melissa. She even quickly befriended RHONJ newcomer Margaret Josephs, which plants her on the opposite side of Siggy Flicker and Dolores Catania.\n\nWhat does everyone think about these great ladies and tonight's episode of #RHONJ on @bravotv @bravoandy A post shared by Danielle Staub (@danielle_staub) on Oct 18, 2017 at 8:26pm PDT\n\nDanielle Staub even managed to make the divide between the New Jersey housewives even wider in her Bravo blog. In it, she divided up each section by RHONJ co-star and addressed the things she did or didn\u2019t like about them and the recent episode.\n\nWhen it came to Siggy Flicker, Danielle made it clear that she was upset about the way that Siggy handled the drama with Margaret.\n\nDanielle Staub goes in on Siggy Flicker\n\n\u201cI met you years ago, Siggy, and I thought you were so nice, and you seemed to have a genuine desire to help heal relationships,\u201d Danielle wrote. \u201cYou intrigued me all those years ago. So it was painful for me to watch you tear at Margaret like you did, even when she reminded you that this wasn\u2019t mirroring your message of empowering other women!\u201d\n\nNow I know a lot of RHONJ fans feel the same way about Siggy as Danielle does. It\u2019s been very apparent on Twitter, where Bravo fans share their thoughts about the episodes in real time, as they watch. I get it. I am also a die-hard Siggy Flicker fan and feel like she wouldn\u2019t have reacted so harshly if she had not been provoked. Also, it\u2019s still incredibly rude to throw cake (or any other kind of food) in a restaurant. I would have went ballistic too.\n\n, the bigger hurt in Siggy\u2019s case seems to come from the beach memorial that Margaret Josephs secretly set up for Teresa Giudice. She didn\u2019t tell Siggy about it beforehand even though it was Siggy\u2019s trip to Boca that she arranged and invited everyone on.\n\nThen, when Siggy didn\u2019t show up for yoga and ignored the group text (something I can see myself doing after the drama from the night before) she still wasn\u2019t told about the special event planned for Teresa that day?\n\nNope! I can\u2019t even blame her for being mad. Not to mention that Margaret has made a very obvious beeline for the popular girls and it\u2019s looking very much like she did what she had to do to bond with Teresa and Melissa in an effort to ensure she\u2019s not a one-season wonder.\n\nAnd then she went for Dolores Catania\n\n\u201cI decided to take your advice. I looked up \u2018loyal\u2019 in the dictionary, and I failed to see your picture or any resemblance of you,\u201d Danielle said about Dolores. \u201cI get you wanting to have Siggy\u2019s back \u201c5,000%.\u201d You are her friend, and it\u2019s obvious you mean a great deal to one another; however, Margaret is a wonderful person with a kind heart. We all see this.\u201d\n\nSeriously, Danielle actually called Dolores Catania disloyal while pointing out how incredibly loyal she\u2019s been to her friend Siggy. Dolores is BFF goals. Who wouldn\u2019t want a friend that had your back 5000 percent? Sign me up for that!\n\nYou all know the heart I have for animals, and tomorrow is a day that is such a special cause for me. The annual @onyxandbreezy gala is tomorrow night! You can still head to the link in my bio for tickets or make sure to tune in to their Facebook page tomorrow at 7pm est for a Facebook live from the red carpet! All of the proceeds from this gala will be going to disaster relief in Puerto Rico! Hope to see you all there\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc36 #onyxandbreezyfoundation #adoptdontshop A post shared by Dolores Catania (@dolorescatania) on Oct 20, 2017 at 11:45am PDT\n\nAnyway, obviously not everyone sees what a wonderful person Margaret is. She is gaining popularity with RHONJ fans rather quickly. She also got in the good graces of Teresa and Melissa and even Danielle Staub with record speed. Does that make her wonderful or just wonderful at working her way up the social ladder and securing her role?\n\nWhile Danielle Staub is busy helping Teresa Giudice and Melissa Gorga stroke Margaret Josephs ego, it\u2019s worth noting that Siggy went out of her way to throw an amazing birthday party complete with a gorgeous (and very expensive) custom cake and her efforts were literally trashed. Just like the way her RHONJ co-stars keep trashing her for being upset about it.\n\nTo make matters worse, Siggy brought Margeret into the mix and invited her on the Boca trip, only to have her efforts to celebrate Melissa\u2019s birthday overshadowed by Margaret\u2019s secret plan to throw a beach memorial for Teresa. And it was a nice gesture, don\u2019t get me wrong but everyone is talking about how Siggy didn\u2019t answer a group text. Considering the magnitude of the ceremony that Margaret planned, if she wasn\u2019t shady, why didn\u2019t she call Siggy up and tell her that there was a huge reason she wouldn\u2019t want to miss out and that it wasn\u2019t yoga."}

With her Olympic gold and bronze medals, 2 World Championship gold medals in 2009 (plus three silver medals in 2007 and 2011), and 4 overall World Cup titles, Vonn is the most successful American ski racer and is considered one of the greatest ever.[6]\n\nIn 2010, Vonn received the Laureus Sportswoman of the Year award [7] and was the United States Olympic Committee's sportswoman of the year.[8]\n\nVarious injuries have caused Vonn to miss parts of several seasons, including almost all of the 2014 season and most of the 2013 season. While recovering from injury, she worked as a correspondent for NBC News covering the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.\n\nEarly life and education [ edit ]\n\nBorn Lindsey Caroline Kildow in Saint Paul, Minnesota, she is the daughter of Linda Anne (n\u00e9e Krohn) and Alan Lee Kildow.[9] She grew up in the Twin Cities metropolitan area in Burnsville, Minnesota. She is of Norwegian ancestry.[10] Vonn was on skis at age two before moving into Erich Sailer's renowned development program at Burnsville's Buck Hill, which also produced slalom racer Kristina Koznick. Her father, who had won a national junior title before a knee injury at 18, \"pushed\" her very hard, according to Sailer.[11]\n\nWhen Vonn was 10 years old, she met Olympic gold medalist ski racer Picabo Street, whom she considers her hero and role model. Their meeting made such an impression on Street that she remembered the meeting and later served as Vonn's mentor in skiing. Vonn commuted to Colorado to train for several years before her family moved to Vail, Colorado in the late 1990s.[12][13]\n\nVonn attended University of Missouri High School, an online program through the university's Center for Distance and Independent Study.[14][15] She speaks German fluently.[16]\n\nSkiing career [ edit ]\n\nEarly years [ edit ]\n\nVonn was taught to ski by her grandfather, Don Kildow, in Milton, Wisconsin.[17] Vonn began skiing as a child in Burnsville, Minnesota, at Buck Hill Ski and Snowboard, and through family vacations that included 16-hour drives from Minnesota to Vail. \"I would be in the back under a sleeping bag, and she'd be driving and singing along to some Eric Clapton tape,\" Vonn said in an interview.[citation needed] By the time Lindsey was 7, she had skied in Minnesota, Colorado, and Oregon year-round. When skiing in Colorado, she had lessons at Ski Club Vail (SCV), an alpine racing program (subsequently expanded and renamed Ski & Snowboard Club Vail) that taught, and still teaches skiers from ages 6 and up.[18][not in citation given] During her first year at SCV, Lindsey skied under \"Gravity Corps\" Ski Coach Colby S. Scudder, Vonn's only female coach, in Ski Club Vail's Gravity Corps \"pre-age-class\" program. The program was directed by Tom Krebs[19][not in citation given] who told the Gravity Corps coaches to not train the skiers inside gates, but instead to develop their all-mountain skiing skills and to develop their comfort in the fall line (the most direct route down a ski slope), while ensuring the kids were exposed to as much terrain as possible \"versatility and exposure to diverse challenging terrain\" was the directive.[20][not in citation given] At that time, the Gravity Corps pre-age-class skiing program consisted of multiple groups of 8\u201310 skiers; it was the only SCV venue open at the club to younger skiers who were not yet old enough to participate in official \"age-class\" USSA or FIS sanctioned events.\n\nLindsey and other members of her gravity Corps group, placed first, second and third, in Gravity Corps unofficial races in which all gravity corps skiers participated in one collective unofficial gathering. The race was set and run by Krebs, and directed as the only time gravity corps skiers should \"be in a race course\".[20][not in citation given] At the end of that first Vail season, Lindsey's mother asked if the coach thought Lindsey was a slow skier; the answer was an emphatic \"NO,\" Lindsey was most definitely NOT a slow skier. It was mentioned that if anyone ever said that Lindsey was slow, it was likely because that person was not recognizing that Lindsey was in a perpetual growth spurt and, that the person saying that Lindsey was slow was not considering that changes in Lindsey's height, affected her center of gravity, etc., and skiing confidence, and thus that person who described Lindsey as skiing slowly was not acknowledging the differences between a growing young male skier vs. a young female skier (who by the age of 11, stood at a much taller height than her peers) - which, in the SCV Gravity Corps Coach's opinion resulted in the devastatingly inaccurate \"slow\" comment. The words used by Colby S.Scudder were more colorful, and much less diplomatic. Based on Lindsey's newly confirmed speed,Lindsey and her mother asked about enrolling Lindsey into the older \"Age-Class\" program, which they said, had previously denied their enrollment request.\n\nThe coach supported the idea of skiing with \"age-class\" skiers. The next season, with the final approval of Director Chip Woods, Lindsey was enrolled into the \"age class program,\" under SCV Alpine \"technical skiing Coaches Reid Phillips, Chip Woods, Todd A. Rash and Gus Pernetz,etc., who collectively perfected Lindsey's early technical skills and began her SCV \"in gate\" training.[21][not in citation given]\n\nIn the late 1990s, Lindsey and her siblings and mother stopped commuting from Minnesota to Colorado and instead moved to Colorado to ski exclusively at Ski Club Vail. During her first SCV year in Vail, Lindsey and one of her sisters skied together in the same \"gravity corps\" SCV group, it was during that first season Lindsey and her family were contemplating if the entire family should move from Minnesota to Colorado. \"Vail was wonderful to me,\" Lindsey said, \"but I missed all the traditional things of childhood \u2013 sleepovers, school dances, making friends in a conventional way. Halfway through the second season, Lindsey's siblings also moved to Vail. \"Now all my brothers and sisters had left their friends for me. That was stressful on them. I felt so guilty.\"[citation needed]\n\nHowever, the move paid off because in 1999 Lindsey Kildow and Will McDonald became the first American athletes to win the \"Cadets\" slalom events in Italy's Trofeo Topolino di Sci Alpino.[22] In 1986, Lindsey's hero, Picabo Street, participated, but did not medal, in the same Topolino event.[22][23][24][not in citation given] In 1995 Lindsey first met Street in person, a few years later, \"Street said was stunned watching a 15-year-old Lindsey ski for the first time in 1999. She marveled at Vonn's knack for following the fall line. 'The faster she went, the bigger the smile she got on her face,' Street said. 'You can't teach somebody to love the fall line like that little girl loved the fall line.'\" [25]\n\nAfter climbing through the ranks of the U.S. Ski Team, she made her World Cup debut at age 16 on November 18, 2000, in Park City, Utah.\n\nIn her Olympic debut at the 2002 Winter Olympics at age 17, Vonn raced in both slalom and combined in Salt Lake City, with her best result coming with sixth in combined. On March 4, 2003, she earned a silver medal in downhill in the Junior World Championship at Puy Saint-Vincent, France.\n\nVonn credits a change in her attitude toward training to a bike ride with fellow ski racer Julia Mancuso and Mancuso's father Ciro when Vonn visited them at their home in Lake Tahoe, California. With little biking experience, she quickly found herself miles behind Julia and Ciro. Alone and embarrassed, she realized she needed drastic revision of her training regimen and her attitude toward training if she was going to be successful.[26]\n\nOn March 24, 2004, Vonn was the downhill silver medalist at the U.S. Alpine Championships at Mt. Alyeska Resort, Girdwood, Alaska. Earlier that year 2004, Vonn climbed onto the World Cup podium for the first time with a third-place finish in downhill in January 2004 at Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. Her maiden victory in that specialty came at Lake Louise, Alberta, in December 2004. She captured five more World Cup podiums over the next two months.\n\nIn 2005, she competed in four races at her first World Championships held in Bormio, Italy, pulling in fourth-place finishes in both the downhill and the combined. She was ninth in super-G, but failed to finish the giant slalom. She cited the unexpected appearance of her father, with whom she has a strained relationship, for rattling her before the event.[11]\n\nLindsey Vonn during a slalom race in Aspen in November 2006\n\nAt her second Winter Olympics in 2006, Vonn clocked the second-best time in the first practice run yet crashed in the second training run for the downhill race on February 13, 2006, in San Sicario, Italy; she was evacuated by helicopter to Turin and was hospitalized overnight. Despite a bruised hip and strong pains, she returned on the slope 2 days later to compete and finished eighth. The gritty performance earned her the U.S. Olympic Spirit Award, as voted by American fans, fellow Team USA athletes, former U.S. Olympians, and members of the media for best representing the Olympic Spirit.\n\nVonn earned her first \"big race\" medals with silver in both downhill and super-G at the 2007 World Championships in \u00c5re, Sweden. A training crash before the slalom caused her a low-level ACL sprain to her right knee, ending her season 4 weeks early. Nevertheless, she finished third for the season in the women's 2007 World Cup disciplines of downhill and super-G.\n\n2008\u20132010: Winning the overall World Cup for three consecutive years [ edit ]\n\nIn 2008, Lindsey Vonn won the overall World Cup title. She became the second American woman to do so, following Tamara McKinney in 1983. American Bode Miller won the men's title to complete the first U.S. sweep of the men's and women's overall titles in 25 years (McKinney and Phil Mahre in 1983). She also won the World Cup season title in the downhill and the U.S. Alpine Championships combined title (downhill & slalom), marking her best ski season to date. Vonn set a new American record for the most World Cup downhill victories with ten, winning at Crans-Montana, Switzerland, on March 8.\n\nVonn in March 2008\n\nIn 2009, Vonn repeated as overall World Cup champion, repeated as downhill champion and also won the season championship in super-G by winning the final race of the season. During the season, she broke Tamara McKinney's American record of 18 World Cup victories when she won the super-G at Tarvisio in February. Her nine World Cup wins also set an American single-season record, surpassing Phil Mahre's total of eight in 1982. At the 2009 World Championships in Val-d'Is\u00e8re, France, Vonn won her first world championship and became the first American woman to win the world super-G title.[27] In the super combined event, she won the downhill portion and had appeared to have finished second in the event with a strong slalom performance, but was disqualified for splitting a gate.[28] Three days later she won the gold in the downhill. During early 2009, she appeared in Alka-Seltzer television commercials in the United States as support for the United States Ski Team. During the summer of 2009, Vonn switched her equipment sponsor and supplier to Head skis, after previously racing her entire career on Rossignol skis.[29] In October 2009, Vonn was awarded the Skieur d'Or Award[30] by members of the International Association of Ski Journalists for her performances during the previous season.\n\nIn December 2009, Vonn sustained a bruised arm after a crash during the opening run of the World Cup giant slalom. She continued racing as there was no fracture that would prevent her return and run at the Olympic Games in Vancouver.[31] Despite skiing with her arm in a brace due to the injury, Vonn won three straight races (two downhills and a super-G) in Haus im Ennstal, Austria from January 8\u201310, 2010. The wins raised her to second among American skiers on the all-time career list for World Cup wins with 28, passing Phil Mahre and trailing only Bode Miller. On January 14, 2010, Lindsey Vonn was named Colorado Athlete of the Year for 2009.[32] With her victory in a super-G just prior to the 2010 Winter Olympics, she clinched her second straight super-G discipline title with two races still to go.[33] Vonn ended up also winning the overall title, as well as the discipline titles in downhill, super-G and combined, and by winning the last super-G of the season, she boosted her overall World Cup victory total to 33, surpassing Bode Miller for the most World Cup victories by an American.[34] The third consecutive overall World Cup title also equals Phil Mahre's American record and makes Vonn the third woman to achieve it, behind Petra Kronberger with 3 straight and Annemarie Moser-Pr\u00f6ll with 5 straight.[34] Vonn was also named by the Associated Press as 2010 Female Athlete of the Year.[35]\n\n2010 Winter Olympics [ edit ]\n\nVonn at the 2010 Arthur Ashe Kids Day in Queens , New York, August 2010\n\nAt the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010, Vonn planned to compete in all five women's alpine events.[36] On February 10, she revealed she had severely bruised her shin in training the previous week. Vonn said the pain from her injury was \"excruciating\" and she would have a difficult time competing at the Winter Olympics.[37] Due to unseasonably warm weather and resultant poor snow conditions, many of the Alpine skiing events were moved back, giving Vonn additional time to heal.[38] On February 17, in her first event, Vonn won the gold medal in the downhill at Whistler Blackcomb, beating longtime U.S. rival Julia Mancuso by 0.56 seconds and becoming the first American woman to win Olympic gold in downhill.[39][40]\n\nFrom left to right: Tina Maze of Slovenia (silver), Andrea Fischbacher of Austria (gold), and Lindsey Vonn of the U.S. (bronze) with the medals they earned in the super-G\n\nIn her second event, the super combined, Vonn finished first in the downhill portion of the race. In the slalom portion, however, she crashed when she failed to get her ski around a right-hand gate. Vonn said her shin wasn't the problem. Gold and silver were won by Maria Riesch and Julia Mancuso respectively.[41]\n\nIn her third event, the super-G, Vonn finished third behind Andrea Fischbacher and Tina Maze, 0.74 seconds behind Fischbacher's winning time.[42] Afterwards, Vonn said she didn't ski the last part of the course as aggressively as she could have and lost the race as a result.[43] In her fourth event, the giant slalom, fog affected visibility. Vonn crashed in her first run, resulting in a broken fourth finger and Vonn's disqualification from the event.[44][45] In her fifth event, the slalom, Vonn lost control and straddled a gate, disqualifying her from the event.\n\n2011: Losing the overall World Cup to Maria Riesch by 3 points [ edit ]\n\nVonn at the Boston Red Sox vs. Baltimore Orioles game, April 2011\n\nAfter 3 consecutive overall World Cups, Vonn faced more serious competition from Maria Riesch of Germany in 2011. Riesch had a strong start to the season by winning 2 downhills in Lake Louise, where Vonn had won 7 races. Vonn placed on the podium in every speed race but failed to finish in several slaloms. Riesch had 5 podiums in the first 6 slaloms and was significantly ahead in the overall ranking by the end of January.\n\nAt the 2011 World Championships in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, Vonn suffered from a concussion she acquired during training a week earlier. She started in 2 events and achieved a seventh place in super-G and a silver medal in downhill.\n\nBack to World Cup and healthy again, Vonn finished ahead of Riesch in several races (including a giant slalom she finished third, best career result in GS until then), she took overall lead for first time that season after downhill event of the World Cup finals in Lenzerheide. The super-G was cancelled due to poor weather conditions, and after the slalom Riesch regained the overall lead by 3 points. The giant slalom was also cancelled due to weather and Riesch was the 2011 overall champion.\n\n2012: Joining the all-event winner's club [ edit ]\n\nVonn won her fourth Overall World Cup Title in 2012. The season opened in October in S\u00f6lden, Austria where Vonn won her first giant slalom. This made Vonn the 6th woman to have won all events at least once.\n\nOn December 2\u20134, 2011, she won all three races in Lake Louise (two downhills, one super-G) for her second career 'hat trick', and with her eleventh win at Lake Louise she surpassed Renate G\u00f6tschl's record for most career wins at a single resort (ten in Cortina d'Ampezzo). On December 7, 2011, Vonn notched her first World Cup victory on U.S. snow, at Beaver Creek, Colorado. Due to a lack of snow in France, its super-G was rescheduled in advance for a Wednesday on the Birds of Prey course. Her limited success on U.S. snow is primarily due to a lack of speed events; only three have been run in the U.S. during her career. It was the first home win by an American woman in 17 years, since Hilary Lindh of Alaska won the downhill in nearby Vail in December 1994.\n\nWith further victories in January 2012, she overtook Renate G\u00f6tschl to become the third most successful female World Cup racer in terms of victories.\n\nOn February 4, 2012, Vonn achieved her fiftieth World Cup victory on the Kandahar downhill course at Garmisch, Germany. The win also gave her 25 career downhill victories, surpassing G\u00f6tschl for second most career DH wins. With a podium finish in Russia on February 18, 2012 Vonn clinched the season title in downhill, her fifth consecutive in that discipline.\n\nVonn's expressed disappointment that she missed the FIS Alpine Record for 2,000 points in a season by 20 points. In her final race of the season at Schladming, Austria, she was not able to improve on her first giant slalom run after losing her pole at the starting gate. Her 24th finish at Schladming led to her loss of a potential 20-plus points for her season record. \"It was possible to get those 20 points, I was in a good position ... If you work so hard to reach your goal but you lose your pole in the very last run, that's hard to take. It will give me even more motivation for next season\", commented Vonn after the race.[46]\n\n2013 [ edit ]\n\nVonn got off to a slow start in the 2013 season, slowed by illness with marginal results in giant slalom and skipping a pair of slalom races in November 2012. She came back quickly once the speed events started, again sweeping all three races in Lake Louise from November 30 to December 2 (two downhills, one super-G) for her third career 'hat trick', and increasing her record for most career wins at a single resort to 14. The three wins increased her career total to 56, moving her past Vreni Schneider into second place all-time among women behind Annemarie Moser-Pr\u00f6ll with 62.\n\nAfter some disappointing results, Vonn announced her decision on December 17 to take a break from the World Cup circuit to fully recover from her earlier illness.[47] She returned and finished in 6th place on January 6 in her first downhill race since her break. Two weeks later she won the downhill in Cortina d'Ampezzo and week later won the giant slalom in Maribor, Slovenia.[48]\n\nWorld Championships [ edit ]\n\nAt the first marathon of the 2013 World Championships in Schladming, Austria, Vonn crashed in the super-G and was airlifted to a nearby hospital. She tore her anterior cruciate ligament and medial collateral ligament in her right knee, with a tibial plateau fracture.[49] Vonn said she would be ready for the 2014 Winter Olympics despite her injury.[50]\n\nWorld Cup Finals [ edit ]\n\nBefore her season ending crash on February 5 in Schladming, Vonn led in the World Cup downhill standings with 340 points. Several were within reach of taking the title during her absence from the tour. Overall champion Tina Maze, who trailed Vonn by more than a hundred points, took a 4th-place finish in M\u00e9ribel and a win in Garmisch to close the gap to a single point with one race remaining at the World Cup finals in Lenzerheide. Weather conditions were in Vonn's favor, as officials canceled the race after numerous delays due to a thick fog on the lower section. As a result, she won her sixth downhill season title despite not competing in a downhill since mid-January.\n\n2014 [ edit ]\n\nVonn traveled to Austria for the first race of the 2014 Alpine Skiing World Cup, but ultimately decided not to compete during the first weekend.[51] She announced plans to return to competition in late November.[51] On November 20, 2013, Vonn re-injured her right knee straining it and partially tearing her right ACL after a crash during training.[52] She returned to competition on December 6, finishing 40th the first of two downhill races in Lake Louise, Canada,[53] then 11th in the second downhill on December 7, followed by a 5th place in the super-G on December 8. In December, she said of her preparation for the 2014 Winter Olympics that \"I'm going to play it safe and race minimal races, so I can get the confidence and the timing and the feeling of racing again. I'm really going to be safe and smart as I can.\"[54]\n\nOn January 7, 2014, Vonn announced that she would not compete in the Sochi 2014 Winter Games because she had re-injured her right knee on December 21, 2013, while skiing in France. \"I am devastated to announce that I will not be able to compete in Sochi. I did everything I possibly could to somehow get strong enough to overcome having no ACL but the reality has sunk in that my knee is just too unstable to compete at this level. I'm having surgery soon so that I can be ready for the World Championships at home in Vail next February. On a positive note, this means there will be an additional spot so that one of my teammates can go for gold. Thank you all so much for all of the love and support. I will be cheering for all of the Olympians and especially team USA!\" [55] ESPN posted a reference to her announcement, a few hours after Lindsey wrote the aforementioned on her Facebook page.[56]\n\n2015: Comeback [ edit ]\n\nVonn made her comeback to the top of the podium on December 6, 2014 at the Women's World Cup downhill race at Lake Louise, Alberta, winning the event in only her second race back.[57] In January 2015, she tied and then overtook Austrian Annemarie Moser-Proell for the most World Cup wins ever.\n\nAt the 2015 World Championships in Vail / Beaver Creek, Colorado, Vonn won a bronze medal in the first of ladies' events, the super-G.[58] She placed 5th in the downhill race and 14th in the giant slalom race.\n\nOn March 18, 2015, Vonn won the last World Cup downhill race at Meribel, France and claimed the World Cup downhill title for the seventh time. Vonn tied with Moser-Proell for the women's record of seven globes in one discipline.[59] The next day, Vonn notched her eight victory of the season by winning the last super-G race. With this win, Vonn took the super-G season title for a fifth time, tying a record shared by German Katja Seizinger, Austrian Hermann Maier and Norwegian Aksel Lund Svindal. She joined Swedish legend Ingemar Stenmark as the only skiers to reach 19 season titles across all disciplines and the overall. Vonn also made a World Cup podium for the 113th time, tying Moser-Proell\u2018s women's record.[60][61]\n\n2016 [ edit ]\n\nVonn started the season by winning the three races contested by women in Lake Louise (2 Downhill, 1 Super G) for her third career victory. This brought her to 70 career World Cup wins, increasing her lead over the previous women's world record holder for most World Cup podiums by a woman (Austrian Annemarie Moser-Proell, 62 career victories) and with her 25th Super G win, she passed Austrian Hermann Maier for most Super G wins for either gender.[62] In January, Vonn tied the record of Annemarie Moser-Pr\u00f6ll for all-time downhill victories at 36 with a win at Altenmarkt-Zauchensee, Austria. Because poor snow conditions resulted in a shorter course, the race was uniquely held over two combined runs, similar to slalom and giant slalom races. Two weeks later in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, Vonn broke Moser-Pr\u00f6ll's record with her 37th downhill victory.\n\n2017 [ edit ]\n\nOn November 11, 2016, Vonn announced on her Facebook page that she had severely fractured the humerus bone of her right arm in a training crash. She had undergone surgery to repair the bone.[63] Vonn returned to the World Cup on January 15, 2017, in the downhill race at Altenmarkt; she finished 13th. On January 20, in her second race back from injury, she won the downhill event in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, capturing her 77th win.[64]\n\nOn December 8, 2017, Vonn stated in an interview she will not be representing the President in the 2018 Winter Olympics and will not attend the White House reception if she wins a gold medal. Vonn made it clear in her statement that she feels that all Olympians represent the United States people, and not the leaders. She was quoted in the CNN article saying, \"Well I hope to represent the people of the United States, not the President.\" [65]\n\n2018 [ edit ]\n\n2018 Winter Olympics\n\nAt the 2018 Winter Olympics, Vonn tied for 6th in Women's Super-G.[66] She won the bronze medal in women's downhill.[67] Vonn dedicated her Olympic races to her grandfather, a Korean War veteran who died the previous November, competing with his initials on her helmet.[68] In a tearful interview following the woman's downhill race, Vonn stated: \"Our family never gives up and I never gave up. I kept working hard and I'm really proud of this medal and I know he [her grandfather] is too.\"[69][70] She later scattered some of her grandfather's ashes near the men's downhill racing course, stating: \"I know that it would mean a lot to him to be back here, a part of him is in South Korea always.\" [71]\n\n2019 [ edit ]\n\nIn October 2018, ahead of the start of the 2018\u201319 FIS Alpine Ski World Cup, Vonn announced that she would retire from competition at the end of the season. Having previously suggested that she would continue until she had broken Stenmark's record for World Cup race victories, she confirmed that she would retire in 2019 regardless of whether she managed to surpass Stenmark's tally or not, explaining that \"physically, I've gotten to the point where it doesn't make sense... I really would like to be active when I'm older, so I have to look to the future and not just be so focused on what's in front of me\". She also said that she aimed to compete in all downhills and super-Gs in the World Cup season, planning to make her debut at Lake Louise at the end of November.[72] However the following month she injured her knee whilst training at Copper Mountain, forcing her to pull out of the Lake Louise races.[73]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nVonn has enjoyed a significant amount of media attention for an alpine skier, making her the face of her sport in the US. She has appeared on The Today Show, Access Hollywood, and The Late Show with David Letterman and has picked up endorsements from notable companies such as Head, Oakley, Red Bull, Rolex, and Under Armour.[74] In 2010, her assets were estimated to be worth over 2.5 million dollars.[citation needed]\n\nVonn in March 2010 with 8 crystal globes, including 3 large ones for FIS World Cup overall titles and 5 smaller ones for various discipline titles\n\nVonn married fellow 2002 Olympian and former U.S. Ski Team athlete Thomas Vonn on September 29, 2007, at the Silver Lake Lodge in Deer Valley, Utah.[75] In November 2011, the couple announced initiation of divorce proceedings after four years of marriage.[76] The divorce was finalized on January 9, 2013.[77]\n\nVonn met golfer Tiger Woods at a charity event in 2012. They started dating in March 2013 before splitting in May 2015.[78][79][80]\n\nVonn frequently stays at the home of Maria H\u00f6fl-Riesch, her friend and former major competitor, in Garmisch, Germany. Lindsey and Thomas Vonn often spent Christmas Eve at the Riesch family home. Vonn is fluent in German (including Austro-Bavarian).[81] During the off-season, Lindsey resides in Vail, Colorado. The most unusual of Vonn's trophies lives in Kirchberg, Austria\u2014Olympe the cow. Vonn won the oversized pet in 2005 in Val-d'Is\u00e8re.[82] Vonn's nicknames are \"Kildon\", \"Don Don\" and \"The Don.\"\n\nThough she makes many public appearances, Vonn says training takes up most of her life except for a few weeks after the ski season. She trains six to eight hours a day for six days per week during the summer, incorporating endurance cycling, tight-rope walking, and reaction training into her indoor regimen.

{"label": true, "txt": "Presenters Niecy Nash, left, and Olivia Munn react as they announce nominations for the 24th Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards at the Pacific Design Center on Wednesday, Dec. 13, 2017, in West Hollywood, Calif. The show will be held on Sunday, Jan. 21, 2018, in Los Angeles.\n\nAs Hollywood remains shadowed by sexual misconduct allegations against some of the most prominent men in the industry, the 2018 SAG Awards are taking some of the first visible steps to reflect the changes in store.\n\nThe annual ceremony's presenters will be all women, E! News can confirm. As a reflection of the current social climate and the demand for greater female visibility everywhere, executive producer Kathy Connell made the initial suggestion to Sandra Dewey, a president at Turner, after being inspired at January's Women's March and the movement that has ensued since, according to The New York Times.\n\n\n\n\"I want to salute women who are coming forward to speak at a very difficult time about very difficult subjects at great risk to themselves,\" Connell told the newspaper.\n\n2018 SAG Awards: Stars React to Their Nominations\n\nThe Weinstein Ripple Effect\n\nHarvey Weinstein\u2019s ouster from the Weinstein Company in light of multiple sexual misconduct allegations against him is causing thousands of other women to speak up and speak out against powerful abusers in the workplace. (Published Monday, Dec. 11, 2017)\n\nAs a result, all 13 of the acting categories as well as the two stunt categories, which are typically awarded before the show, will be handed out by female presenters. Per the newspaper, there is one caveat as the \"Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture\" category will be introduced by both men and women, but the award will be presented by a woman.\n\n\n\nFollowing suit, announcement of the nominations Wednesday morning was also carried out by women--actresses Olivia Munn and Niecy Nash. To boot, the show's first-ever host will be Kristen Bell. \"I'm not the first female host,\" \"The Good Place\" star told The New York Times. \"I'm the first host. The fact that a female was chosen to be the first one means my genitals become irrelevant.\"\n\nOf course, men will still be present and honored. \"We don't want to slight the men who have given great performances this year--knowing our membership, I'm sure our men will embrace the opportunity to honor women,\" Connell told The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nAs women prepare to run the show come Jan. 21, fans and critics alike are bracing for impact as initial nominees still indicate imbalanced female representation in Hollywood. Such was the case with the 2018 Golden Globe nominations, which lacked a single female nominee for Best Director, snubbed Patty Jenkins' powerful and high grossing production, Wonder Woman, entirely and was disproportionate in the amount of films about men versus their counterparts.\n\nAs Dewey told the newspaper, \"For so many years there's been so much ground to cover in terms of trying to have women statistically catch up.\" While there's still a great deal to be done, the 2018 SAG Awards are inching a few square feet forward.\n\nOriginal Post: All of the 2018 SAG Award Presenters Will Be Women\n\n\u00a9 Copyright E!

{"label": true, "txt": "Open just about any women's magazine and you'll find ads for anti-cellulite creams that promise to reduce the spongy, dimply, cottage cheese-looking skin that causes distress to so many women.\n\nThe products tout caffeine, retinol and the antioxidant DMAE as the special ingredients that help reduce the appearance of cellulite, which first surfaces on the hips, thighs and buttocks of millions of women during adolescence. Though excess weight and a lack of exercise can contribute to the problem, even thin women grapple with it.\n\nAccording to a study by Neutrogena, 70 percent of women have cellulite. More women have it than men, because women have thinner skin, so it shows more clearly.\n\nWrestling With Cellulite\n\nOver the years, Vivian Carlson has done everything to stay in shape: she runs, goes to the gym and eats healthily, but has had no luck in getting rid of her cellulite. At one point, she even took a dust buster to her inner thigh, hoping to suck the dimply skin away.\n\n\"I heard about the treatments they give at the spas \u2014 this wasn't so different,\" Carlson said. \"It's all suction and massage. Why spend the money on the spa treatments? I thought I was on to something.\"\n\nBut all she got for her efforts was some red skin. So Carlson avoids wearing dresses or skirts and wears a skirted bathing suit to the beach.\n\nShe's not alone, and that is why the interest in anti-cellulite creams is so strong.\n\nLinda Wells, editor-in-chief of Allure magazine, says the new products claim to help with the appearance of cellulite, and do not say that they can banish it completely\n\n\"No cream will get rid of cellulite,\" Wells said. \"And they don't really say that they do. What they say is 'help the appearance of cellulite.'\"\n\nCaffeine is in almost every cellulite-reducing product that shows any benefit, because it helps blood flow to the skin and works like a diuretic, Wells said, adding that it flushes you out.\n\n\"In removing moisture from the skin, it firms it, albeit temporarily,\" Wells said.\n\nRetinol is supposed to work by being able to penetrate the skin, exfoliate it, and increase collagen production, which makes skin thicker and hides the dimpling fat. But the question is how much is needed in the products to achieve the effects, because too much can dry out the skin and cause it to redden and peel, Wells said.\n\nOther creams boast the ingredient dimethylaminoethanol or DMAE, an antioxidant derived from fish that when combined with amino acids supposedly stimulates the muscles to contract and become firmer.\n\nNo Scientific Proof\n\nBut doctors told ABCNEWS.com there is no scientific proof that cellulite creams are effective in getting rid of cellulite or reducing its appearance.\n\nWomen who believe that they can eliminate cellulite through creams, or even weight loss, are likely to be disappointed, said Dr. Garry S. Brody, a professor of plastic surgery at the University of Southern California.\n\n\"So-called cellulite is the natural anatomic contour characteristic of many women's thighs and buttocks,\" Brody said. \"It is unrelated to weight gain or loss. There is absolutely no surgical or medical solution to women's dislike of this appearance except for the psychological self-deception of wanting to believe the ads.\"\n\nCellulite Is the Norm\n\nDr. Lisa M. Donofrio, an assistant professor of dermatology at Yale University School of Medicine, and Tulane University School of Medicine, agreed that there is no scientific proof that the creams work, and there is no concrete way to measure cellulite, either. She tells her patients that cellulite is normal, and is likely the product of genetics and hormones.\n\n\"Cellulite is a storage pattern of superficial fat,\" Donofrio said. \"Instead of fat being stored diffusely it is stored in little pockets separated by fibrous strands called septae.\"\n\nContrary to what patients have heard or read, cellulite is not the result of toxins, poor circulation or clogged lymphatics, she said. In fact, one study that compared cellulite fat to other fat found no biochemical differences. If patients really want to try something to get rid of cellulite \u2014 beyond diet and exercise \u2014 they can try the creams, but she suggests buying the inexpensive variety, and giving it eight weeks to work.\n\nOne doctor said that he has heard anecdotally from his patients that the creams help eliminate the appearance of cellulite, but there is no medical proof to back it up.\n\n\"I have never read a convincing research article that explains how anti-cellulite creams work,\" said Dr. Ron M. Shelton of the New York Aesthetic Center. \"We do know that they do not create long-lasting effects. The topical therapy must be continued to maintain the results.\"\n\nTheoretically, at least, cream ingredients such as methylxanthine \u2014 caffeine is one form of it \u2014 are chemicals that reduce fluid retention, which can make cellulite worse. But there is a lack of medical data showing that the products can be absorbed well into the fat through the skin surface, Shelton said.\n\nReaching the Fat Cells\n\nDonofrio said there have been a few small trials by cosmetic companies or physicians who are \"testing\" their own products, but she questions how the cellulite is measured.\n\nOne 1999 published study showed no improvement in cellulite for 56 women who had tried a tissue-kneading machine or aminophylline cream, one of the ingredients in current anti-cellulite creams.\n\n\"The main problem is twofold: Do these ingredients have any merit when applied topically, and at what concentration?\" Donofrio said. It is \"pretty ludicrous\" to think that a topical agent could get through multiple layers of skin and into the fat, but even if that were possible, no one has studied at what concentration it would be possible, she said.\n\nThere is also no standardized means of measuring cellulite, making it difficult to gauge whether improvement has indeed taken place, she said. Both caffeine and aminophylline, ingredients found in the creams, are dehydrating chemicals.\n\nIt is postulated that they perhaps show benefit by changing the water content of the skin overlying the fat, and change the look of that skin. But only Retin-A, which is available by prescription and is known generically as tretinoin, has been proven to do that.\n\n\"Retin-A thickens the uppermost skin cell layer \u2014 this has been scientifically proven,\" Donofrio said. \"If the skin over the cellulite is thicker, the cellulite won't 'bulge' out so much. Let's say you have a down comforter that is lumpy. It will look a lot lumpier with a thin cotton cover that it will with a thick canvas cover to camouflage it.\"\n\nThe over-the-counter alternative to Retin-A is a metabolite of tretinoin called retinol, but the concentration as which it can thicken the skin to improve cellulite \u2014 if it can at all \u2014 is unknown, she said.\n\nPerhaps the solution is simply accepting cellulite, Donofrio says.\n\n\"I like to think that in some parallel universe, somewhere, the lumpy distribution pattern of fat was picked by society to be the beautiful one, and all those with the smooth pattern were labeled as boring,\" she said."}

{"label": true, "txt": "When Matt Czuchry signed on for The Good Wife pilot in 2009, his biggest TV role to date was his breakout role of Logan Huntzberger on Gilmore Girls. So it was a particularly strange turn of events that Czuchry's first post-Good Wife role would be\u2026 Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, Netflix's forthcoming four-part revival.\n\n\"The universe is a crazy thing,\" Czuchry tells The Hollywood Reporter. \"In terms of that timing of putting one character down and picking another up, it couldn't be more special. I love the character of Logan, I love the character of Cary so to bridge that gap between them both was incredibly unique and couldn\u2019t have been more perfect timing.\"\n\nCzuchry reprises his role as Logan, Rory's college boyfriend, in the limited series, which hits Netflix on Friday. Like the long-lasting legacy of Gilmore Girls, The Good Wife has continued to endure despite going off the air in May after seven seasons.\n\nCzuchry's co-stars on the legal drama, Christine Baranski and Cush Jumbo, will reprise their roles as Diane Lockhart and Lucca Quinn, respectively, for a spinoff titled The Good Fight. Like the flagship drama, The Good Fight hails from co-creators and showrunners Robert and Michelle King and will be produced by CBS Studios. Unlike The Good Wife, The Good Fight will air on CBS All Access, with the exception of the first episode, which will premiere on CBS.\n\nIn addition to Baranski and Jumbo, Sarah Steele and Gary Cole will reprise their roles from the original series. However, it sounds unlikely Czuchry will follow suit. \"No, there hasn\u2019t been any talks on either side about that,\" he says about a possible appearance.\n\nCary Agos might be a harder piece to fit back into the puzzle, given how things ended for him. Having grown hardened and bitter from years of infighting at the firm, Cary quit Lockhart, Agos and Lee in the fourth-to-last episode. In the finale, he appeared in a brief scene with Alicia (Julianna Margulies) and Jason (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) that showed he had segued into teaching law rather than practicing it.\n\n\"I felt like the closure was actually the episode where he quit the firm and left,\" Czuchry says. \"So for me, that was his last episode.\"\n\nWhen asked about his thoughts on the finale, and particularly that now famous slap between Diane and Alicia, Czuchry is mum \u2013 but with good reason.\n\n\"I never saw the last episode,\" he says. \"Of course I read it, but that was an episode where it was all about, for me personally, being with the crew and the cast and saying goodbye. So I had watched all the episodes up until that point for research; that one I wanted to leave as just something special on set.\"\n\nIt sounds like Czuchry has no intention of changing that anytime soon, saying, \"I have no plans to watch it.\"\n\nIn contrast, it sounds like he will be tuning in for The Good Fight when it premieres in February. \"I've emailed with Christine and Cush, and I'm excited for them,\" he says. \"They're both great, so I'm excited for both of them and want to see what it's going to be like.\"\n\nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life premieres Nov. 25 on Netflix."}

{"label": true, "txt": "About 10 years ago, at the after-party for a wine auction in New Orleans, a woman in her 20s walked up to Mario Batali to introduce herself. As a chef, she was excited to meet one of the most revered figures in the restaurant industry. When they started talking, she recalls, she realized that he\u2019d been drinking and he became what she characterized as \u201ccreepy\u201d \u2014 \u201cjust giving me this provocative, icky feeling.\u201d\n\nMinutes into their conversation, she recalls, he told her, \u201cCome work for me, I\u2019ll pay you double what you\u2019re making.\u201d Moments later, someone bumped her glass, spilling wine all over her chest and down her scooped-neck shirt. She alleges that Batali began rubbing her breasts with his bare hands while saying something like, \u201cLet me help you with that,\u201d as he groped her chest. \u201cHe just went to town, and I was so shocked,\u201d the chef says. \u201cJaw on the ground, I just stepped back from him in utter disgust and walked away.\u201d\n\nThe chef is one of four women who allege that Batali touched them inappropriately in a pattern of behavior that appears to span at least two decades. Three of the women worked for Batali in some capacity during their careers. One former employee alleges that over the course of two years, he repeatedly grabbed her from behind and held her tightly against his body. Another former employee alleges that he groped her and that, in a separate incident, he compelled her to straddle him; another alleges that he grabbed her breasts at a party, though she no longer worked for him at the time. The woman whose allegations are described above has never worked for Batali, though she works in the restaurant industry.\n\nBatali was reprimanded for inappropriate behavior in the workplace as recently as two months ago. According to a spokesperson for Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group \u2014 the restaurant-management services company that provides support to around 24 restaurants owned by, among others, Batali and Joe Bastianich \u2014 in October 2017, a B&B restaurant employee officially reported inappropriate behavior by Batali to the company. It was the first formal complaint about Batali, who was reprimanded and required to undergo training, according to the company.\n\nIn a statement to Eater, Batali said that he is stepping away from the day-to-day operations of his businesses for an unspecified period of time. ABC, where Batali has co-hosted the daytime show The Chew since 2011, has also asked the chef to step away from the show \u201cwhile we review the allegations that have just recently come to our attention,\u201d a spokesperson said.\n\nBatali did not deny all the allegations, saying that they \u201cmatch up\u201d with ways he has behaved.\n\n\u201cI apologize to the people I have mistreated and hurt. Although the identities of most of the individuals mentioned in these stories have not been revealed to me, much of the behavior described does, in fact, match up with ways I have acted. That behavior was wrong and there are no excuses. I take full responsibility and am deeply sorry for any pain, humiliation or discomfort I have caused to my peers, employees, customers, friends and family.\n\n\u201cI have work to do to try to regain the trust of those I have hurt and disappointed. For this reason, I am going to step away from day-to-day operations of my businesses. We built these restaurants so that our guests could have fun and indulge, but I took that too far in my own behavior. I won\u2019t make that mistake again. I want any place I am associated with to feel comfortable and safe for the people who work or dine there.\n\n\"I know my actions have disappointed many people. The successes I have enjoyed are owned by everyone on my team. The failures are mine alone. To the people who have been at my side during this time \u2014 my family, my partners, my employees, my friends, my fans \u2014 I am grateful for your support and hopeful that I can regain your respect and trust. I will spend the next period of time trying to do that.\u201d\n\nBatali remains an owner of his individual restaurants, according to the B&B spokesperson. In a statement to Eater, B&B said that while the company has had sexual harassment training and policies for more than 10 years, it will now also enlist an independent, outside corporate investigations firm for any staffers wishing to make claims against owners of the restaurants.\n\n\u201cWe take these allegations very seriously. We pride ourselves on being a workplace for our employees where they can grow and deliver great service with equal opportunity and free from any discrimination. We have strong policies and practices in place that address sexual harassment. We train employees in these policies and we enforce them, up to and including termination,\u201d B&B\u2019s statement reads in part. \u201cMr. Batali and we have agreed that he will step away from the company\u2019s operations, including the restaurants, and has already done so.\u201d\n\nJoe Bastianich said in a statement, \u201cRight now, I\u2019m just focused on ensuring that our more than 1,000 employees continue to have a safe and positive work environment.\u201d An ABC spokesperson said in a statement, \u201cABC takes matters like this very seriously as we are committed to a safe work environment. While we are unaware of any type of inappropriate behavior involving him and anyone affiliated with the show, we will swiftly address any alleged violations of our standards of conduct.\u201d\n\nAlthough B&B has been sued for sexual harassment before, Batali\u2019s own alleged inappropriate sexual misconduct has not previously been the subject of a lawsuit. Each of the women who spoke to Eater asked to remain anonymous in part for fear of retaliation \u2014 Batali, a celebrated and powerful chef, holds enormous sway in the restaurant world and beyond. Eater is granting them anonymity but has corroborated their stories with friends, family members, or colleagues who were informed of the incidents, as well as with publicly available information.\n\nMany of the people who spoke with Eater said they were afraid of retribution for speaking out. A woman who claims she was inappropriately touched while she worked for Batali in the late \u201990s told Eater, \u201cHe has clear intent on being threatening when he is wronged. And the level of vindictiveness is very chilling. So, it never occurred to me to share tales out of school.\u201d\n\nThe multiple accusations of inappropriate touching and other misconduct emerged from an Eater investigation that included interviews with dozens of industry professionals who have had interactions with the chef, including nearly three dozen current and former Batali employees.\n\nBatali, who became a star as the host of one of Food Network\u2019s first hit TV shows, Molto Mario, has risen to the very top of the restaurant industry since starting out in a New Jersey sandwich shop in the early \u201980s as a college student. Along with Joe Bastianich and Lidia Bastianich, he is the force behind Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group, which notably includes the New York City restaurants Del Posto and Babbo, each of which holds one Michelin star. Five years ago, B&B reported more than $250 million in annual revenue. Batali is also a minority shareholder in the Italian-market chain Eataly USA, which has six locations across the country.\n\nOutside of his restaurants, Batali is the author of numerous cookbooks, the face of nationally distributed jarred pasta sauces and other kitchen products, and the jolly, orange-Crocs-wearing co-host of ABC\u2019s daytime talk and cooking show The Chew. He also founded a child education and empowerment nonprofit and is active in (RED), the nonprofit founded by celebrities Bono and Bobby Shriver. Additionally, Batali owns a small percentage of Ken Friedman and April Bloomfield\u2019s landmark gastropub, The Spotted Pig. People Eater spoke to within the industry often describe him as a friendly, charming, professional, supportive, and frequently generous person.\n\nBut his affable persona belies another, more crude reputation, according to dozens of interviews. Batali\u2019s lewdness, his crass way of speaking about women, and his focus on women\u2019s bodies have been well known within certain circles in the restaurant world, according to people who spoke with Eater.\n\nA former server at P\u00f3, the now-shuttered West Village restaurant where Batali built his reputation throughout the \u201990s, alleges that repeated physical harassment took place while Batali was the chef.\n\nSteve Crane, who co-owned P\u00f3 with Batali until the chef decamped to start his future empire, confirmed that he was told by multiple staff members of ongoing inappropriate behavior by Batali. Though Crane does not recall any specific details, and was not in the kitchen to personally witness the incidents, he said that he was told by several female staffers that Batali had grabbed them from behind, consistently made a variety of sexual comments, and engaged in behavior like snapping bra straps. \u201cI made it very clear to him that he needed to stop, but I feel ashamed that this happened at P\u00f3, and my staff endured this behavior,\u201d he said. Crane said that because they were partners in the restaurant, he ultimately did not have the power to fire Batali. (Batali, through a spokesperson, denied that Crane ever confronted him.)\n\nThe former server alleges that on multiple occasions Batali grabbed her from behind \u201clike a linebacker, like a disgusting bear hug,\u201d and pressed her body against his. In hours of interviews with Eater, she described nearly two years of inappropriate behavior. The grabbing would often occur while they were alone in a cramped passageway between the dining room and the kitchen, she alleged. \u201cHe would breathe on me \u2014 and sometimes take a deep inhale, like he was smelling me,\u201d she recalled.\n\nWhen Crane asked Batali to stop, Batali would become more aggressive, the server alleged; some female staff eventually started asking Crane to not confront Batali with their complaints, she added. (Crane confirmed that after some women would complain, they would ask him not to confront Batali because he would only be more aggressive toward them.)\n\nRestaurant culture in the \u201990s was generally known for being \u201cbawdy,\u201d and sexual relationships between staff weren\u2019t uncommon, the former server said, but Batali\u2019s behavior was more about degradation than good humor, she alleges: \"This wasn't just some dirty jokes, this was mean, this was about asserting power. He is awful.\"\n\nLee McGrath, a chef who joined P\u00f3 a few years after Batali left as chef, told Eater that when he was hired, Crane warned him, \u201cDon\u2019t even think about messing with the waitresses \u2014 they\u2019ve been through hell with Mario.\u201d\n\nA different woman, who worked for Batali in the late \u201990s, alleges that he touched her inappropriately on two different occasions. The first incident allegedly took place soon after she started her job. One day, while she was in the dining room of the restaurant, she said, Batali came up behind her, catching her unaware, and \u201cput his hand on half of my butt and he squeezed it.\u201d She recalled later gently confronting Batali, who responded, \u201cWhat are you, a lesbian?\u201d\n\nIn a second incident that took place about three years later, she alleges that while working next to Batali in a small, boxed-in space, he was seated in such a way that he blocked her exit. When she had to get up, he refused to move \u2014 leaving her no choice but to straddle him in order to leave the space. According to the woman, she told Batali that she needed to go to the bathroom. Batali, who was reclining with his legs propped up, allegedly told her, \u201cIf you want to get up, you\u2019re going to have to climb over me.\u201d When she returned, he was still seated with his legs propped up, again refusing to move; she had to straddle him a second time, she alleges. \u201cIt was disappointing, again, to have that happen. And, again, humiliating,\u201d she said.\n\nYet another woman who worked for Batali for about a year in the late aughts alleges that he lunged at her and grabbed her breasts during an industry party in 2011, a few years after she stopped working for him. At the party, she recalled that Batali appeared drunk, and she became concerned for his safety when she spotted him on a balcony standing slumped over. \u201cWhen I noticed that he looked wobbly, my instinct was concern,\u201d she said. When she walked over and tapped him on the shoulder, \u201che sprung up, like he was startled,\u201d and with his eyes wide open. Then, immediately, \u201che lifted his arms straight up and grabbed both of my breasts,\u201d she said. \u201cI took a step back and I pushed him away, and when I did that, I remember he said, \u2018Oh, come on.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that moment I realized, \u2018I\u2019m just a body [to him],\u2019\u201d she said of the experience. Though at the time, she no longer worked for Batali, she had worked for him a few years prior and said she believed they shared some mutual respect. \u201cWhen I\u2019ve seen him over the years, I don\u2019t have a sense that he even remembers,\u201d she said, though she added, \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to him about it.\u201d\n\nThe chef who alleged being groped at an industry party in New Orleans about 10 years ago, as described earlier, said she remains appalled by his behavior. \u201cHe gets wasted, he\u2019s arrogant, and he acts like he\u2019s God\u2019s gift to women,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is still your industry, you\u2019re a leader in this industry \u2014 if you behave this way, what kind of example are you setting?\u201d\n\nIn addition to the allegations of improper physical contact, several sources said that Batali has a reputation for inappropriately using sexual innuendo in workplace conversation. Multiple people who work at or have worked at Batali restaurants from the early \u201990s to now described behavior that ranges from mild creepiness to more severe misconduct, both in interviews with Eater and in publicly available documents.\n\nThe woman who was allegedly groped by Batali on the balcony told Eater, \u201cI remember not being fully surprised that it happened because I\u2019d seen him drunk and flirtatious with women. And that flirting came in the form of talking and sitting really close. I\u2019d never witnessed anything during work hours; it was always post-work.\u201d\n\nBut according to other interviews, his inappropriate behavior happened at work, too. McGrath, the P\u00f3 chef who started about a year after Batali left, said that he eventually understood why he was given the warning to not harass the female waitstaff, as two servers, including one who spoke with Eater, began to relay accounts of Batali\u2019s misconduct. \u201cIt\u2019s like they had PTSD,\u201d he said. McGrath remembers being told that there was a lot of \u201chugging from behind\u201d and that Batali would ask about their sex lives, what color underwear they wore, and other inappropriate questions.\n\nAnother former female P\u00f3 staffer, who worked at the restaurant earlier than the woman mentioned above, said that Batali could be generally \u201cnasty\u201d and a \u201cbully\u201d to both men and women. He was \u201cconstantly making overtly sexual and inappropriate\u201d comments, she alleges. Though she doesn\u2019t remember physical touching, she said that she\u2019s never worked for someone more inappropriate than Batali. At one point, she wanted to take out an ad in the paper to say what \u201can awful person he was\u201d because she thought it was unfair that he was getting so many accolades considering how terribly he treated people, she said. \u201cMario is smart and he\u2019s talented, but I don\u2019t think that gives you the right to be disgusting,\u201d she said.\n\nThe employee who Batali allegedly groped shortly after she was hired said that she has witnessed \u201ca lot of gray-area affection with women,\u201d like \u201ca lot of subliminal dissection of women\u2019s bodies, telling women their asses looked good, remarking on boobs.\u201d\n\nThe chef\u2019s boorish side has also been previously documented in the media. In the 2006 book Heat, the writer Bill Buford provides a glimpse at the earlier years of Babbo and Batali\u2019s tenure on the Food Network, noting crass behavior with two female prep chefs, as well as an assistant and a set manager. In one incident detailed in the book, during a food- and wine-filled evening at Batali\u2019s Greenwich Village trattoria Lupa Osteria Romana, Buford writes that Batali said to a female server: \u201cIt\u2019s not fair I have this view all to myself when you bend over. For dessert, would you take off your blouse for the others?\u201d\n\nA manager at a B&B restaurant said that while he loves working for Batali \u2014 who has been good to the kitchen staff and very professional with both male and female chefs, in his experience \u2014 he has seen Batali treat women outside of the kitchen crudely, especially while intoxicated. Eater granted him anonymity, as he is still employed by the company and fears losing his job. \u201cI really like the guy, and every sober interaction has been very professional, but, yeah, he\u2019s gross,\u201d the manager said.\n\n\u201cHe was always friendly, but it was in this \u2018Oh, you\u2019re a pretty little girl\u2019 kind of way,\u201d Gabriela Acero, a former maitre d\u2019 and floor manager who worked at Batali\u2019s Greenwich Village restaurant Otto from 2012 to 2014, said. \u201cI remember him complimenting my dress, saying something like \u2018Oh, don\u2019t you look like the blossoming bosom of spring.\u2019 Even then I was like, \u2018Oh, Jesus.\u2019\u201d\n\nBatali\u2019s reputation has left some of the women who\u2019d benefited from his power and influence with mixed feelings about their relationship with him. He\u2019s championed the careers of numerous women; his kitchen at Del Posto is led by a female executive chef and executive pastry chef. (\u201cIt\u2019s not because they have a vagina,\u201d he said of the crew while at the Fast Company Innovation Festival in October. \u201cIt\u2019s because they\u2019re the smartest people for the job.\u201d)\n\n\u201cI feel very complicated feelings toward him,\u201d the former employee who described two encounters with Batali said. \u201cIn some ways, he was very supportive and he used his power and influence to connect me.\u201d\n\nThe former employee who alleged having her breasts grabbed described working for Batali as frequently professional. \u201cI definitely felt way more reverential about him then than I do now,\u201d she said.\n\nThese allegations come as dozens of prominent and powerful men have been toppled by accusations of sexual harassment and inappropriate conduct. In the restaurant industry \u2014 notorious for its boys-club culture \u2014 chef John Besh was brought down by allegations of rampant sexual harassment in his restaurants, and former Jean-Georges pastry chef Johnny Iuzzini has been accused of sexual harassment by four women.\n\n\u201cI think it says so much about how we just accept and move on, and I think for a long time, I just thought, \u2018Well, he didn\u2019t rape me,\u2019\u201d said the woman who alleged being grabbed at an industry party in 2011. \u201cBut I remember it vividly, it impacted me, and I feel uneasy recalling it. I just feel this major sense that I\u2019m not the only one. I feel really grateful for the cultural reckoning that\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nAnyone with information about alleged misconduct in the restaurant world can contact Eater at tips@eater.com or via these secure methods."}

In addition, it introduced the President of the United States, Fitzgerald Grant III (Tony Goldwyn) and his chief of staff Cyrus Beene (Jeff Perry). The season focuses on the lives of the team members, the relationship between Olivia and the President (her former employer), and the mystery surrounding Amanda Tanner's (Liza Weil) involvement with the White House, among other cases the team solved.\n\nSeason 2 [ edit ]\n\nAn assassination attempt is made on Fitz's life, which almost kills him. As a result, Sally Langston (Kate Burton) takes over as President, much to Cyrus' dismay. After surviving, Fitz decides to get a divorce, which Mellie (Bellamy Young) tries to avoid by somehow convincing her OB/GYN to induce her labor four weeks early. Huck (Guillermo D\u00edaz) is arrested for the attempted assassination after being framed by his girlfriend Becky (Susan Pourfar). After David (Joshua Malina) helps Huck go free, Huck, Olivia and her team trick Becky to show up at the hospital where she is arrested. Fitz finds out that Verna (Debra Mooney) was behind the assassination and kills her. At the funeral, he reveals to Olivia that he does not want a divorce as he is devastated after learning about the rigging from Verna.\n\nThe second arc focuses on finding the mole who is leaking classified information from the White House. Olivia and the team investigate the case after figuring out that the CIA Director's suicide was actually a murder. Olivia gets to know Captain Jake Ballard (Scott Foley), who works with the leader of B613, Rowan (Joe Morton), who orders Jake to get close to Olivia. At the end of the season, Mellie gives Fitz an ultimatum: either he becomes loyal to her, or she goes on national television and reveals Fitz's affair with Olivia. Fitz chooses Olivia, which makes Mellie reveal the affair. Fitz announces his re-election campaign. As Olivia and the team continue to investigate who the mole is, Huck manages to capture Charlie (George Newbern), who reveals the mole's identity: Billy Chambers (Matt Letscher). They figure out that Billy is working with David, who steals the Cytron card, but frames Billy and gives Cyrus the card in exchange for being reinstated as US Attorney. At the end, Olivia's name is leaked to the press as being Fitz's mistress, and it is revealed that Rowan is Olivia's father.\n\nSeason 3 [ edit ]\n\nAfter Olivia's name is leaked to the press as Fitz's mistress, Olivia Pope & Associates faces financial troubles when all their clients fire them. The firm accepts \"new\" clients in order to pay the bills. Rowan becomes more involved with Olivia's life, which begins to affect her, and leads Huck and Jake to investigate B613. They discover during a military action code named \"Operation Remington\", Fitz shot down a civilian aircraft over Iceland and Olivia's mother was one of over 300 casualties. Determined to find out the truth about Operation Remington, the firm investigates Rowan and learns that a passenger was removed from the flight by a Federal Marshal just prior to take off. Quinn (Katie Lowes) starts to hang out with Charlie, who sets her up to kill a security guard who was an eye-witness to the Federal Marshal's removal of the passenger. As a result of Quinn's inadvertent murder, Huck tortures her and she leaves the firm.\n\nMeanwhile, Fitz faces problems when Congresswoman Josephine \"Josie\" Marcus (Lisa Kudrow) is in the running to win the Democratic Party primary against Senator Samuel Reston (Tom Amandes) and become the first female president of the United States. Cyrus tries his best to find dirt on Marcus in order to ruin her campaign, but fails. After Olivia finds out that Fitz shot down the plane which killed her mother, she declines the offer of being the campaign manager for Fitz's re-election and becomes the manager for Josephine Marcus'. After an incident with Marcus' sister, Josephine backs out of her campaign. The second part of the season focuses more on the re-election campaign as Olivia has taken over as the campaign manager. At the same time, Sally announces that she is running for President by being an Independent. As a result, Fitz chooses the Governor of California, Andrew Nichols (Jon Tenney), as his new Vice Presidential running-mate. Nichols develops a relationship with the First Lady, Mellie. The campaign faces problems when Sally, stricken with guilt over murdering Daniel (Jack Coleman), almost reveals the truth at a debate. Cyrus asks Jake to help protect the secret, which he does by killing James (Dan Bucatinsky) to prevent exposing Cyrus's involvement in the cover up. The president's eldest children, Jerry (Dylan Minnette) and Karen Grant (Madeline Carroll), come to the White House for an interview, but Olivia soon figures out that they aren't pleased with their parents.\n\nSeason 4 [ edit ]\n\nAfter the passing of a close friend, Olivia returns to D.C. and is shocked by the state of OPA. The first half of the season focuses on Jake's arrest for the death of Jerry Grant after Rowan forces Tom (Brian Letscher) to name Jake as the operator. Rowan continues to try to make everyone believe Jake is guilty, which inspires Olivia to find out the truth for herself. After forcing Tom to reveal Rowan as his operator, Fitz, Jake, and Olivia make a plan to arrest Rowan. Unfortunately, the plan fails, causing Rowan to shut down B613 and start eliminating B613 agents. Olivia tries to kill Rowan when she confronts him, but he manages to flee. Abby (Darby Stanchfield) is now the White House Press Secretary, and is struggling with gaining the respect of Cyrus and Fitz, because they choose to demean her by calling her \"Red\" instead of Abby. Later in the season, Abby finds herself stressed even more by the presence of her abusive ex-husband, who has been nominated for Virginia State Senator, and she enlists Leo Bergen (Paul Adelstein) to help ruin his campaign. Quinn has stayed in contact with both Abby and Huck, in addition to trying to find Olivia.\n\nMellie struggles with the death of her son, Jerry. She finally comes to terms with her loss after finding out that Jerry was murdered due to being deliberately exposed to bacterial meningitis rather than contracting the disease naturally, and she chooses to form an alliance with Elizabeth North (Portia de Rossi). Later, after having an affair with him, Mellie discovers the true nature of Nichols, who threatens to tell the press about their affair. In the season finale, members of a grand jury gathered by David for the B613 case were killed after the initial hearing. OPA and David begin investigating the scene, and realized that Rowan was responsible. He also blackmailed Mellie into giving the names of the members, causing her to feel responsible. Cyrus later finds out the truth, but decides not to tell Fitz. After seeking advice from Maya (Khandi Alexander), Olivia and Jake decides to reveal B613 to the CIA, but it backfires. They later came up with a plan to frame Rowan for embezzlement of the funds at the museum he is working at, having him imprisoned. Later, Fitz finds out the truth about what Mellie and Cyrus had done; he orders them to leave the White House. Elizabeth then takes Cyrus' place as the chief of staff. In the last scene, he reunites with Olivia.\n\nSeason 5 [ edit ]\n\nOlivia and Fitz now embrace being a couple, going public with their relationship, thus leading to Olivia taking on many more of the First Lady-established roles in the White House. She continues managing Olivia Pope & Associates, which Marcus Walker (Cornelius Smith Jr.) becomes a part of, even using it to spin her image once the world looks down on her due to her new relationship with the President. However, by the midpoint of the season she feels too suffocated in this new life, and so she leaves Fitz, the White House, and secretly has an abortion. Olivia returns to her old life, dealing with the aftermath of her and Fitz's break up, and Rowan gets out of jail and reclaims Jake as his lapdog, while Fitz starts sleeping around and is put in his place by Abby. Meanwhile, Cyrus and Mellie are forced to move on with their lives now that Fitz has kicked them out, Cyrus struggling to figure out what he wishes to do next, and Mellie running for and being elected as a senator, being her next step in making a run for the presidency, which is the main focal point of the second half of the season.\n\nMellie makes a run for the presidency and takes Olivia on as her campaign manager, having to go against the likes of current Vice President Susan Ross (Artemis Pebdani), Hollis Doyle (Gregg Henry), and Pennsylvania Governor Francisco Vargas (Ricardo Chavira), the latter of which has his campaign managed by Cyrus. David and Elizabeth push for Susan's presidential run, and David begins to fall for her while also entering into a sexual relationship with Liz, ending in heartbreak for two of the three parties involved. Quinn and Charlie begin seeing each other, and Cyrus also has marital problems with Michael (Matthew Del Negro). Jake marries Vanessa Moss (Joelle Carter) as per Rowan's arrangement, and also kills her father, also upon Rowan's request. Olivia brutally murders former Vice President Nichols when he starts to recover from his paralysis and threatens to expose a great number of secrets, Fitz learns of her secret abortion, and the season concludes with Mellie and Frankie named as the respective Republican and Democratic nominees, with Jake and Cyrus selected as their respective VPs.\n\nSeason 6 [ edit ]\n\nOn March 3, 2016, ABC renewed Scandal for a sixth season,[10] which premiered on January 26, 2017. The entire season is about the murder of President-elect Frankie Vargas. It is revealed that his wife, Luna, was behind his murder because she wanted power. The end of season six concludes with Mellie becoming the first female President of the United States. At the end of Fitz's term, he decided to reinstate a B613 and become Command, due to Rowan's manipulation of him. Olivia convinces him not to, because she thinks it will destroy him. Then she has Mellie reserve a percentage of the Pentagon's funds in a blind emergency trust and uses that money to reinstate B613 herself. Olivia becomes Command at the end of the season and considers herself the most powerful person in the world.\n\nSeason 7 [ edit ]\n\nOn February 10, 2017, ABC renewed Scandal for a seventh season;[11] on May 10, 2017, it was announced that this season would be the show's last.[12] On January 3, 2018, a crossover with How to Get Away with Murder was announced,[13] which aired on March 1, 2018, with Viola Davis and Aja Naomi King guest starring.[14]\n\nCast and characters [ edit ]\n\nProduction [ edit ]\n\nConception and development [ edit ]\n\nIn early 2011, it was announced that Shonda Rhimes was developing a new pilot. In February, Kerry Washington was cast in a leading role.[16] Actress Gabrielle Union and Taraji P. Henson auditioned for this role alongside Washington before she was officially chosen. Henry Ian Cusick also landed a role in the series.[17] On February 28, 2011, it was announced that Tony Goldwyn landed the role as the president.[18] In May 2011, ABC picked up the pilot as a mid-season replacement.[19] During the Winter Television Critics Association Press Tour, it was announced that the show would premiere April 5, 2012 after Grey's Anatomy, relocating Private Practice to Tuesday nights.[20]\n\nThe program was renewed for a second season on May 11, 2012, in the same Thursday timeslot, while Private Practice remained in the new Tuesday evening timeslot to finish its final season.[21] Rhimes had stated at the time that the second season would likely be thirteen episodes or less,[22][23] but the renewal of the series after the fall meant that the second season would have two arcs through the season; the first covering the main 13-episode order, with the second arc taking place during the \"back nine\" order.\n\nScandal was renewed for a third season on May 10, 2013.[24] Along with other ABC dramas, this season was split into two runs of uninterrupted episodes, the first consisting of ten episodes. The second run, initially set to consist of 12 uninterrupted episodes, began on February 27, 2014.[25] On December 7, 2013, ABC Studios, announced that due to Kerry Washington's pregnancy, the overall episode order would be trimmed from 22 to 18,[26] which led the season finale to air four weeks earlier on April 17, 2014.\n\nThe show was renewed for a fourth season by ABC on May 9, 2014.[27] On May 13, 2014, ABC announced their new schedule, as well as a new time slot for Scandal. The show remained on Thursday night, but it was moved to 9:00 PM E.T. to make room for ShondaLand Production Company's new TV series, How to Get Away with Murder.[28] In August 2014, ABC programmed its entire Thursday primetime lineup with ShondaLand dramas Grey's Anatomy, Scandal and How To Get Away With Murder, then branded the night as \"Thank God It's Thursday\" (or \"TGIT\").[29] This echoes ABC's former TGIF branding of its Friday night family sitcoms and even NBC's Must See TV promotion of formidable Thursday night television hits in the 1990s.[30]\n\nThe remaining fall schedule for ABC was announced on October 30, 2014, where it was announced that Scandal would air nine episodes in the fall with the fall finale to air on November 20, 2014, just like the rest of ABC's primetime lineup \"TGIT\" Grey's Anatomy and How To Get Away with Murder.[31] The remaining 13 episodes aired after the winter break, beginning on January 29, 2015,[32] and ending with the season finale on May 14, 2015.[33]\n\nScandal was renewed for a fifth season on May 7, 2015, by ABC. The series will continue to air at Thursdays in the timeslot 9:00 p.m. E.T. like the previous season, as it was moved to the timeslot to make room for Shondaland Production Company's new TV series, How to Get Away with Murder. Production began on May 21, 2015, when Rhimes announced on Twitter that the writers were in full swing mapping the fifth season.[34]\n\nThe series was renewed for a sixth season on March 3, 2016, by ABC.[35] Production is scheduled to begin in July, confirmed by executive-producer Tom Verica.[36] After Kerry Washington announced that she was pregnant again, TVLine reported that ABC is considering moving the show's premiere to midseason.[37] In addition, the episode order for the sixth season was reduced from 22 to 16 episodes.[38] During ABC's annual upfront presentation in May, it was announced that Scandal will premiere during midseason, following a fall run of the new series Notorious.[39] Production began on July 13, 2016, with director and executive producer Tom Verica announcing that the crew was scouting for filming locations.[40] The table read for the premiere was on July 26, 2016, with filming starting soon after.\n\nOn February 10, 2017, ABC announced that the series had been renewed for a seventh season.[41] On May 10, 2017, ABC announced that the seventh season would be the show's final season.[12]\n\nCrew [ edit ]\n\nWriting [ edit ]\n\nIn an interview with showrunner Shonda Rhimes, she revealed that the fourth season would highlight Darby Stanchfield's character, Abby Whelan. She said \"Season 4 is Abby's season. That was by design. A lot of what we know about Abby happens this season.\"[42] Rhimes also confirmed the speculation about the fate of the character Harrison Wright, who she confirmed was killed.[42] She said that all the people at OPA will cope in different ways to Harrison's death, Olivia the hardest. Rhimes said \"It will be very devastating for Abby in a surprising way. You'll see how she's coping with it in a very different way than you would expect.\"[43] Olivia will deal with her betrayal to everyone she left behind, when she hears about the fate of Harrison. The betrayals changed everyone permanently, and Olivia will have to deal with it.[43]\n\nShonda Rhimes stated that the fourth season will focus more on the core characters, as opposed to the third season where more characters were introduced. Rhimes explained why: \"Kerry Washington couldn't work 14 hours a day, so we had to tell our story in a different way, and that necessitated other people both picking up the slack in beautiful ways\".[43]\n\nShonda Rhimes said in an interview that the fifth season will begin only a few days after the events in the fourth-season finale. She stated that the fifth season will see Olivia and Fitz the only people standing in a single piece, as she said \"The world had been fairly blown apart for everybody except Olivia and Fitz. Everybody else was in a fairly blown apart place ... We pick up right there in that environment and we see what happens next.\" Rhimes continued talking about Cyrus and Mellie and their situation of not being in the White House anymore.[44] Rhimes also confirmed that \"the reconstitution\" of Team OPA would happen in the fifth season, as Rhimes revealed in an interview with TVLine, as she explained that the Gladiator conceit was sidelined a bit in the fourth season to instead \"healing\" Olivia. She noted that \"a lot of times it was just Huck and Quinn gladiating by themselves. And that wasn't the same dynamic.\"[45]\n\nWhen talking about the presidential campaign storyline in the show, showrunner Shonda Rhimes talked to The Hollywood Reporter about the character Fitzgerald Thomas Grant III not being president anymore. She said \"I can't tell you any of that \u2014 but there is a plan. Tony is not going anywhere; where would he go?!\". Other cast members spoke their opinion about Grant's next arc without the presidency. Tony Goldwyn, the actor playing Fitz, commented \"He'll be much happier as the post-president than as the president.\" Jeff Perry, playing Cyrus Beene, said that \"I'd love our show to invent a great role for a president after he's out out office that would reverberate back to the real world.\" Executive producer Betsy Beers voiced her excitement about the character doing \"anything he wanted\". Other cast members compared Fitz's next move with former U.S. presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton.[46]\n\nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Rhimes talked about the presidential election and its factor into the sixth season. She said that it would in both ways, adding that \"We are basically going to start our season on election night. Yes, it is going to play into our season, but we're not going to spend our time playing an election.\"[47]\n\nCasting [ edit ]\n\nThe first season had nine roles receiving star billing.

I'm also not entirely sure that it matters. Scandal is a good example of what a show is about being far less important than how it's about it.[110]\n\nIndieWire, a daily news site reviewed the first season of Scandal, comparing it to the FX show Damages. Stating that the premise was similar and that Damages is a hell of a show, and worthy of all the accolades; but it's what Scandal could be, if the envelope was pushed a bit more, and if the show took more risks.\"[111]\n\nNewsday's Verne Gay called the series \"fun\", but added:\n\nAll the tropes, cliches and (especially) soap conventions series creator Shonda Rhimes has poured so generously into Grey's Anatomy and Private Practice over the years have been poured right back into this Beltway potboiler. The hairpin plot twists. The whiplash character reveals. The bumptious moralizing. The Strong Woman/Wronged Woman character type, and its direct corollary, Weak, Middle-Aged, Married Man Who Secretly Likes Hookers. It's all here![112]\n\nThe show however received many more positive reviews during its second season. The A.V. Club's Ryan McGee compared to the show to House of Cards, stating:\n\nScandal has quite a bit to say about how people in general operate. By extension, it also has a lot to say about the type of television people respond to in this ever-splintered viewing environment. In a year in which almost all ratings are down, Scandal has gone up. Its insane storytelling really isn't insane at all. Many want to dub House of Cards the future of television as a whole. In terms of distribution, this may be true. But by giving audiences what they want, and then giving them so much more than they ever expected, Scandal is the show those looking toward the future of television should be aiming to actually produce, regardless of the medium in which it is viewed.[113]\n\nAlan Sepinwall of HitFix also changed his stance:\n\nWhen Scandal debuted last spring, I wasn't sure what to make of it, beyond recognizing that Kerry Washington had the goods to carry a series and Shonda Rhimes had fashioned an excellent role for her. This season, though, Rhimes has kicked the show up to another level by ditching the Crisis of the Week procedural format in favor of reinventing Scandal as a gonzo hybrid of conspiracy thriller and high-stakes soap opera, involving election rigging, a presidential assassination attempt, a failed internal White House coup, and all sorts of other crazy shenanigans. It's ludicrous on virtually every level; it's also an enormous amount of fun, thanks to the writing and the performances.[114]\n\nRatings [ edit ]\n\nIn 2016, a New York Times study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that Scandal \"displays the classic pattern of a show popular with a black audience\".[115] Ratings grew significantly over the second season, reaching a series high with the season finale which increased 25% in total viewers and 39% in Adult 18\u201349 compared to the first season's finale.[116]\n\nThe season 3 premiere had 10.5 million total viewers, up 71 percent from last season's start in September 2012.[117][118] The season finale had 10.5 million total viewers, up 15% from last season's finale in May 2013.[119] The third season had an average of 11.5 million in Total Viewers, up 39% from the second season which had a total of 8.3 million. It also went up in Adults 18\u201349 with 43% with an average of 4.0/12, while the previous season had a 2.8/8. This qualifies Scandal as TV's fastest growing returning series.[119]\n\nThe fourth-season premiere also scored a series high in Total Viewers with 11.96 millions and in adults 18\u201349 with a 3.8/11.[120] The series was its ratings increase from week to week compared to its broadcasting last year.[121][122][123] The mid-season premiere \"Run\" was equaled the series's 2nd-highest-ever rating in adults 18\u201349.[124] The fourth season saw a decrease in the 18\u201349 key demographic by 5.4 percent to a 2.9, but an increase in total viewers by .86 percent with an average of 9.19 million viewers.[125]\n\nSeason Timeslot (EST) Number of Episodes Premiere Finale TV Season Overall rank Overall viewership Date Viewers\n\n(millions) Date Viewers\n\n(millions) 1 Thursday\n\n10:00 pm 7 April 5, 2012 7.33[126] May 17, 2012 7.33[127] 2011\u201312 62[128] 8.21[128] 2 22 September 27, 2012 6.74[129] May 16, 2013 9.12[130] 2012\u201313 47[131] 8.46[131] 3 18 October 3, 2013 10.52[132] April 17, 2014 10.57[133] 2013\u201314 16[134] 12.00[134] 4 Thursday\n\n9:00 pm 22 September 25, 2014 11.96[135] May 14, 2015 8.08[136] 2014\u201315 18[137] 12.66[137] 5 21 September 24, 2015 10.25[138] May 12, 2016 6.65[139] 2015\u201316 29[140] 10.68[140] 6 16 January 26, 2017 7.62[141] May 18, 2017 5.23[142] 2016\u201317 39[143] 8.16[143] 7 Thursday 9:00 pm (1\u201314)\n\nThursday 10:00 pm (15\u201318) 18 October 5, 2017 5.52[144] April 19, 2018 5.46[145] 2017\u201318 53[146] 7.41[146]\n\nSocial media [ edit ]\n\nScandal is one of the most popular shows on social media.

{"label": true, "txt": "Each week, host Jeff Probst will answer a few questions about the latest episode of Survivor: David vs. Goliath.\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: We saw Mike respond to your catchphrase of \u201cGot nothin\u2019 for you\u201d with \u201cWe\u2019ve got nothing for you either.\u201d You actually kind of like it when contestants give it back to you a bit, don\u2019t you? After all, I remember some of those classic Probst\u2013Penner interactions of yesteryear.\n\nJEFF PROBST: Ah, it\u2019s the best! Most of those \u201cSurvivor phrases\u201d I say are really silly and yet because we\u2019ve stuck with them they\u2019ve become part of the fabric of the game. I still get a huge kick out of saying them because on one hand it\u2019s tongue in cheek, and on the other hand it\u2019s Survivor gospel. But, it does take a certain storytelling swagger for a player to throw it back to me and have it land. Occasionally players will try to make a similar type of joke and it just doesn\u2019t work. Mike White is obviously a hall-of-fame storyteller and that was a great moment.\n\nAfter Mike had his epiphany that Christian needed to go and everyone got on board, Angelina pointed out that she had pushed for that exact same thing at the prior vote to no avail, while also making a comment that whenever a woman had tried to spearhead a plan this season that she had been ignored. You\u2019ve seen a lot of Survivor in your day. Generally speaking, have you noticed a difference in the way men\u2019s and women\u2019s ideas are received in this game?\n\nYes, absolutely. I think if we went back through old seasons and studied how interactions between women and men have changed over the years we would be shocked. Survivor is a microcosm for life, and what Angelina is referring to reflects what is happening in our culture at large. The way men and women relate to each other is undergoing a dramatic shift. It\u2019s a change that is needed and one that I find very exciting. And this changing landscape is impacting Survivor.\n\nFor instance, I can\u2019t imagine doing another \u201cMen vs. Women\u201d season. It just seems ridiculous right now. And I do find it interesting that Angelina has a lot of fans, but also a lot of detractors. People who think she is too bossy or arrogant. You could list a lot of men who have played similar types of games and they\u2019re often called \u201cthreats.\u201d Of course, in this situation there are a myriad of potential mitigating circumstances (like trust issues or bragging rights) that may have contributed to how Angelina was treated. But big picture, I think we\u2019re going to continue to see a shift in how the genders relate to each other. It\u2019s one of the anthropological benefits of this delicious \u201csocial experiment\u201d we like to call\u2026 Survivor!\n\nSo Davie and Dan both play their idols and then John goes home. Some big reactions from folks when all three of these events happened. Being on the scene, what did you make of it all and what do you think people were most surprised by in this entire chain of events?\n\nMy biggest takeaway from a tribal like this is, \u201cwe put the right people on this season!\u201d THAT is how you play this game. People are playing to win and I love it. I truly believe the reason we haven\u2019t seen a resentful jury in years is because of the mutual admiration and respect that everyone has for how most everybody else plays the game. They all know this is a game of deception. The key is, I need to get you before you get me. The complication comes when we realize we could get further in the game by working together. Now we have a relationship and trust starts to develop and the game gets more difficult.\n\nBut when you see this kind of gameplay happening at Tribal Council, you know that it\u2019s coming from players who realize that no matter who I promise or who I align with or who I think I can trust \u2014 it\u2019s still a game of \u201cI need to get you before you get me.\u201d\n\nSo Johnny Mundo gets nailed on the double-idol play. He certainly looked the part of a Goliath when he showed up this season. How would you sum up his time on the island?\n\nWe really wanted John on the Goliath tribe but there was a scheduling issue and we were told he couldn\u2019t do it. It was a major disappointment. Then one day, I got a call \u2014 \u201cHis schedule changed, he can do it!\u201d It was one of the best days in casting because we knew John would bring the physical representation of a Goliath but also many more layers that would surprise people. John\u2019s a deep thinker and a smart guy. We hated to lose him. I think if he played again, he might play a bit more aggressively, but I really enjoyed having him on the island.\n\nIt looks like the shifting continues next week. What can you tell us about what\u2019s coming up?\n\nUh\u2026 let\u2019s see\u2026 how should I put this? Well, it\u2019s the night before Thanksgiving, you don\u2019t have school the next day and you probably don\u2019t have work\u2026 so you should DEFINITELY NOT MISS IT! How\u2019s that? It\u2019s a really fun episode that the audience is going to love.\n\nWatch an exclusive deleted scene above and make sure to read our episode recap.

I\u2019m a performer, that\u2019s who I am by nature.\u201d She also said that despite her outlook on self-love and acceptance, she\u2019s not giving up on her theatricality, saying, \u201cI\u2019m a girl that likes a beat face, let\u2019s not get it twisted.\u201d\n\nYou might also like: A Look Into Billie Eilish\u2019s Precipitous Rise to Fame\n\nAlong with being most notable for her grandiose looks and sexy pop songs, she has always preached a self-love agenda. In her song \u201cBeautiful,\u201d which was released in 2002, the lyrics tell her story of dealing with insecurities and trying to overcome them and learning to love herself, \u201cno matter what they say.\u201d\n\nIn the Paper Magazine interview, Aguilera talks about still dealing with those who put her down for her looks, saying, \u201cThere\u2019s always gonna be those trolls out there or people that have their own definition and ideal of beauty\u2026 everybody that can\u2019t hop on that train can suck our dicks.\u201d\n\nFor over a decade, Aguilera has been teaching her fans to accept themselves for who they are, and if you\u2019re a person who hates on people for being who they are, then she has no time for you.\n\nIn 2011, Aguilera joined NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Voice\u201d as a coach for its first three seasons. It was being on this show that made her realize that artists in the past few years have had to face a lot less scrutiny than she ever did when she started in the early 2000s, saying how it was a \u201cvery controversial time for me.\u201d\n\nShe raves about how artists today are instead praised for taking risks and being sexually empowered. Although women still face a double standard on sexuality, whether it\u2019s being overtly sexual or not sexual enough, Aguilera sees true progression for women, saying, \u201cMadonna had to go through it in her day, and she paved the way for my generation to come up. And paying it forward, now a younger generation is coming up and I\u2019m loving what I\u2019m seeing. It\u2019s so incredible.\u201d\n\nYou might also like: Why I Chose School Instead of Music (at Least for Now)\n\nOn the cover of Paper Magazine, Aguilera only sports a gold ring that says \u201cMom.\u201d Aguilera opens up in the interview about the domestic abuse her mother went through and how that has also taught her about self-love and raw beauty.\n\n\u201cI watched my mom have to be submissive\u2026 there\u2019s a psychological damage and mental abuse that comes with being in a situation like that. A lot of people don\u2019t have the ability to vocalize it themselves or have the know-how to get out.\u201d Aguilera swore from a young age that she would never get herself in a similar situation, saying how you can either fall down the same path or go down the other path and never allow yourself to rely on another person for happiness.\n\nYou might also like: Sleeping at Last Has Released \u2018Six,\u2019 the Latest Track on His Complex Concept Album\n\nAguilera also opens up about how she plans to raise her two children. Knowing that social media is becoming more and more influential to children, Aguilera takes the same advice she gives on loving and accepting yourself and applies it to raising her kids in a world where information and ideas are constantly at their fingertips. \u201cThere\u2019s always gonna be the good and the evil, the dark and light\u2026 I really want to make sure my children are both very confident in the sense that they know who they are and that they won\u2019t be easily swayed by outside opinion.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not every day that an artist goes barefaced on the cover of a magazine just for fun, so Aguilera fans are questioning whether this is the start of a new era for her, in terms of new music. Her fans wonder whether her new music will have aspects of this new look of hers \u2014 stripped-down and raw.\n\nAlthough Aguilera has neither hinted or commented on the speculations, one can only hope to see the release of a new album with her preaching self-love and showing off her amazing pipes. When asked to give one piece of advice, she said, \u201cBe fearless in breaking new boundaries and don\u2019t be afraid to go against the grain of criticism along the way.\u201d"}

In fact, many of us are perfectly content with sticking with our normal style of dress, but wouldn\u2019t mind adding a small tweak or two to make things fun. Below, we\u2019ve rounded up some easy-to-replicate ideas about what to wear on New Year\u2019s Eve that are understated but also festive and wholly chic.\n\nWear your best shoes\u2014with jeans.\n\nThere\u2019s no hard-and-fast rule that says thou shalt wear cocktail attire on December 31. In fact, oftentimes the trick to looking like the most effortlessly stylish woman in the room is to take the opposite route by keeping your clothes basic\u2014think skinny jeans and a go-to blouse\u2014and adding your best shoes. So modern!\n\nRock a statement ear cuff\n\nThe beauty of the ear cuff is its ability to make any outfit look that much edgier\u2014a plus if you\u2019re wearing a cocktail dress or \u201cgoing out\u201d clothes.\n\nClip a flower in your hair\n\nDo like supermodel Sasha Pivovarova and add a clip-in flower to your hair. Don\u2019t worry about your tresses being perfect\u2014it looks much more modern on sexy, mussed-up hair. The beauty of this idea? You can walk into any H&M or Forever 21 and buy a pack of clip-in fabric flowers right now for under $5.\n\nSwap the LBD for a sleek black jumpsuit\n\nIf you\u2019re headed to a New Year\u2019s party, it\u2019s a safe bet that at least 25% of the women there will be rocking LBDs. Stand out from the crowd in a fashion-forward way with a fabulous jumpsuit instead. If you don\u2019t have one, and don\u2019t necessarily want to dash out and buy one before the 31st, fake it by wearing a great pair of black trousers, and your favorite black top\u2014a cami, a silk tee, a long sleeve blouse\u2014tucked in, and add a killer shoe.\n\nRock super-bold nails and lips\n\nNothing boosts your party look quite like a saturated matte red, orange or pink lip. Plus, it\u2019ll provide a nice antidote to the hordes of gold-and-glitter-makeup out there on the 31st. As for nails, we\u2019re big fans of keeping them in the same color family as your lipstick for a festive, notice-me look.\n\nAdd colorful earrings\n\nGlittery statement earrings are having a huge moment, and will instantly elevate any outfit.\n\nMake a hair statement\n\nPay a visit to your local salon (or braid bar, if your city has one) and opt for a messy fishtail braid. If you\u2019re really feeling daring, pick up some hair chalk or temporary color spray rock out with pink, lavender or blue."}

Jonathan Brady\u2014PA Wire\n\nWhile using Givenchy, a French fashion house, was unexpected, Clare Waight Keller designed Markle\u2019s wedding dress. The British designer was Givenchy\u2019s first female artistic director last year, Kensington Palace announced.\n\nMarkle\u2019s dress featured an open bateau neckline and a triple silk organza underskirt, according to Kensington Palace. And though no price has been publicly released, we do have an idea about how much custom Givenchy dresses cost: When Kim Kardashian wore one at her 2014 wedding to Kanye West, it was valued at $500,000.\n\nSamantha Brown, a New York-based celebrity stylist, tells MONEY that although the dress may initially appear simple, the fabric and tailoring likely drove the cost up.\n\n\u201cThe gown is exquisite in its fit, and the fabric drapes perfectly,\u201d she says. \u201cWhile it isn\u2019t beaded or embellished, two components that always signify \u2018expensive,\u2019 the attention to detail and, of course, Givenchy price tag surely make this gown extremely lux.\u201d\n\nDawn Del Russo, a fashion expert and founder of Bella Dawn, says Markle\u2019s wedding dress has an \u201cabsolutely American princess feel.\u201d \u201cHaute couture gowns like this can be priced as high as $340,000,\u201d she adds. \u201cSafe to say her couture designer gown that will be marked in history is in the hundreds of thousands.\u201d\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle during their wedding service, conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby in Windsor, Britain, May 19, 2018. Owen Humphreys\u2014Pool/Reuters\n\nThe ceremony caps off weeks of speculation about who would design Markle\u2019s wedding dress, what it would look like and how much it would cost. Many of the rumors were linked to a comment Markle made about her favorite wedding gown of all time: the one Carolyn Bessette Kennedy wore at her 1996 ceremony, a slip dress the New York Times that was about $40,000 back then. Others were inspired by her Suits character, Rachel Zane. When Markle-as-Zane got married on TV, she wore a $6,800 Anne Barge creation in the Versailles style.\n\nSimilarly, the wedding dress Markle\u2019s sister-in-law \u2014 Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge \u2014 wore when she wed Prince William in 2011 was also fiercely debated. Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s wedding dress was the subject of much debate when she wed Prince William back in 2011. Whereas royals aficionado Katie Nicholl told Entertainment Tonight this past March that Kate\u2019s parents paid \u00a3150,000 \u2014 about $203,000 \u2014 for the dress, the Daily Mail reported at the time that it cost \u00a3250,000 \u2014 about $338,000.\n\nHowever, Nicholl did predict that Markle would avoid outdoing her sister-in-law.\n\n\u201cI think it was very unlikely that Meghan would spend more than that, and in doing so try and upstage a future queen,\u201d she told ET.\n\nBut Markle didn\u2019t have to worry about exceeding the budget of her late mother-in-law, Princess Diana. According to CBS News, Diana\u2019s dress cost just $13,000. And Queen Elizabeth II paid for hers with coupons."}

Between intervals, I lift weights. Right now I\u2019m sticking to light weights because I have a herniated disc in my lower back. It\u2019s pretty severe, and I have to work around it. I love squats, but I\u2019ve been told that I have to do lunges instead of squats for the time being. I know a lot of people wouldn\u2019t find that heartbreaking, but I really do!\n\n\"I\u2019m off-season right now, so I work out three days a week. But when I\u2019m getting ready for an event or in the summer, it\u2019s five days a week. I don\u2019t exercise more than that though, because I see better results when my body has a rest period.\"\n\nThere are perks to everything\u2014you just have to look\n\n\"In some ways, it\u2019s been more challenging to get back in shape after my second daughter. Yet it\u2019s not as hard as I thought it would be, because I\u2019m always running around with the kids. I never sit down\u2014I\u2019m on the move all day. And I don\u2019t keep junk food at home anymore, because I\u2019m trying to set a good example. So there are no more Krispy Kremes for me to grab.

Don\u2019t laugh, but they\u2019re on the way here right now!\"\n\nRely on tricks to look lit\n\n\"For me, glowing skin comes from the inside. I start to get sallow if I\u2019m not eating well. I take fish oil supplements. And I love coconut oil. I apply it to my face. That\u2019s my go-to. I also drink a lot of water. I always keep a bottle with me and kind of force myself to drink. My skin just looks better when I\u2019m hydrated.\n\n\"I wear makeup every day. Typically, it\u2019s minimal\u2014a little eyeliner, lip liner and balm, and some concealer. It takes me about five minutes to apply it. But when I get ready for an event or a dinner, I do like to take my time putting my makeup on. To me, the process of getting ready can be really, really romantic. It takes me probably 45 minutes because I go very slow.\n\n\"I\u2019ve learned some very good makeup tricks too, like how important it is to work with your face shape. Because I have a long face, my makeup artist taught me to swipe blush across one cheek and lightly over the nose, then over the other cheek to help break up the length a bit. Another great tip to try: Add some illumination to your Cupid\u2019s bow right above your lip by putting a little bit of highlighter\u2014or even a dab of light eyeshadow\u2014there. That will give some pop to your lips.\"\n\nProtein is your power\n\n\"I usually start my day with eggs. I think they\u2019re like magic\u2014you can do so much with them. I mostly keep it simple and have scrambled eggs and a piece of Ezekiel toast for breakfast. But if somebody brings over muffins or some other kind of delicious treat, I\u2019ll eat that with my coffee instead. It\u2019s a terrible way to begin my day, though. I really regret it later, because I just don\u2019t have as much energy. I find that when I start out with the right source of protein, it definitely helps.\n\nI grew up eating rice and beans, so I want some kind of grain in every meal. For lunch, I usually have salmon and rice or quinoa, and I try to include a salad. I\u2019ll eat the same thing for dinner. I\u2019m a creature of habit in that way. I don\u2019t get bored with food. I try to think about it as fuel for my body. But what I am looking forward to is the time when dinner becomes a sit-down situation again. Right now I\u2019m in survival mode with two babies, eating on the go.\u201d\n\nA little sugar is important too\n\n\"Sweets are my thing. It\u2019s ongoing, and I have to manage my sugar cravings constantly. I\u2019ve gotten used to having something sweet after every meal, so I\u2019m always bartering with myself: No, no, I can\u2019t have that after dinner, but maybe I can have it after lunch instead. The kid in me thinks, I work out, so I can support my sugar habit. I know that\u2019s not a very wise thing to say, but I really do feel like I\u2019m working it off!\"\n\nFor more from Eva, pick up the April issue of Shape, on newsstands March 14th."}

At 14, the actress nabbed the Academy\u2019s last juvenile award \u2014 a special prize, first given in 1935, for child performers like Shirley Temple and Judy Garland \u2014 for her turn as the perpetually sunny heroine of Pollyanna. But not only did she miss the 1961 ceremony, she didn\u2019t realize it had occurred at all. \u201cI didn\u2019t know very much about the Oscars,\u201d Mills admits. \u201cI didn\u2019t know very much about anything, really. So it was all a big surprise.\u201d\n\nOf course, Mills has a much clearer understanding now, at 71, of what her achievement meant. Here, she looks back on her early career, the moment she received her Oscar, and where the trophy \u2014 a miniature version of the statuette \u2014 went.\n\nLoomis Dean/The LIFE Picture Collection/Getty Images\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: Pollyanna was the first of six features you made with Walt Disney. What do you think now of your performances as a child actor?\n\nHAYLEY MILLS: The majority of the movies that I made when I was a child [were] very well-written. I worked with wonderful, experienced actors and actresses and excellent directors. If you can\u2019t turn in a halfway decent performance with that kind of support around you, obviously you aren\u2019t supposed to be doing it. I started acting at a time when children were younger. Television wasn\u2019t such a big thing, there were no iPhones or iPods or computers, and we stayed living in our imaginations as children. I don\u2019t think we grew up as quickly. So [acting] was just a short step from the games I played, the imaginary games which all children do.\n\nDo you have any fond memories of your time on Pollyanna?\n\nMaking Pollyanna was a wonderful experience. I\u2019d made one movie before in England, and we shot a lot of it on location in Wales, and it was terribly cold. It was what I was familiar with. It was England. And suddenly I found myself for the first time in my life in not just California, but Hollywood, and that had a huge impact. I was there with my mother and my little brother, and to be on Walt Disney\u2019s studios, that was, you know, I didn\u2019t really have that much to compare it with.\n\nWe stayed in the famous Chateau Marmont hotel in those little cabins and looked down over Sunset Boulevard. I spent most of my time I think in Schwab\u2019s, the pharmacy, sitting on those stools and having ice cream sodas and hot fudge sundaes, and getting carried away by all the comics. Walt Disney took us to Disneyland and we stayed there overnight, and my brother who was 9 at the time decided that he wanted to live in Disneyland and we had great difficulty dragging him out. California and Hollywood in those days, it was magic for a child.\n\nBuena Vista/Getty Images\n\nYou worked with Oscar winners on that set, including Jane Wyman (above) and Karl Malden.\n\nI remember Jane Wyman with enormous affection. She was warm and sweet and kind and lovely to me. And Karl Malden used to make me laugh a lot. He always said, when we did a scene together, the scene was about our two noses, because I had \u2014 and still have [laughs] \u2014 not the most aristocratic nose in the business, and neither did Karl.\n\nWatch the full episode of Hollywood\u2019s Greatest Untold Stories now on PeopleTV. Go to PeopleTV.com, or download the PeopleTV app on your favorite mobile or connected TV device.\n\nIn fact, the first day on Pollyanna was the scene with Karl Malden on the hill where he\u2019s practicing his sermon, and it was my first day on this movie, and it was terribly hot, and I had this big bow on the back of my head and a fake plait stuck on. And my boots were very new and stiff, and my clothes was itchy, and all I could think about really was how desperately I wanted to get to the catering truck because down the hill, there it was. I\u2019d never seen such amazing looking American food, and I was distracted to say the least. They didn\u2019t get a single shot in the can in the morning.\n\nThey did eventually \u2014 and you went on to win the juvenile Oscar. At the ceremony, Annette Funicello accepted the trophy on your behalf from Shirley Temple. Do you remember why you couldn\u2019t make it to the show?\n\nI was actually at boarding school in England, and I didn\u2019t know anything about it until it turned up. Like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s sweet. What\u2019s that?\u201d I was told, \u201cWell, this is a very special award,\u201d but it was quite a few years before I began to appreciate what I had.\n\nWhen did that finally happen?\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t until the 75th Oscar ceremony, where I was one of the [former] winners on stage. The curtains parted, and I found myself staring out at the Kodak Theatre, and I looked straight at Richard Gere and [Martin] Scorsese, and nearly fainted. I thought, \u201cMy God, I\u2019m actually a part of this!\u201d I hadn\u2019t ever felt that connection, and it was extraordinary. My heroes were on that stage with me, and I was considered to be one of their number!\n\nWhere is your Oscar now?\n\nI\u2019m terribly embarrassed to say this, because it looks so careless, but it has disappeared. In the late \u201980s, I came to California to do a television series [Good Morning, Miss Bliss]. When I came back from that first year, my little statuette had disappeared, and I never found it. And you know, it\u2019s not something you can replace. They\u2019ve broken the mold. I spoke to the Academy, and I said, \u201cWell, look, give me a big one then!\u201d [Laughs] They said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, it doesn\u2019t work like that.\u201d But I\u2019d say for 25 years it was on the mantelpiece in my drawing room, and I was always very proud of it.\n\nAt the time, how did winning the Oscar affect the way you viewed your career? Did it change the way you viewed it at all?\n\nIt didn\u2019t change the way I viewed my career, and maybe that was one of the reasons why my parents decided A, not to tell me about it, and B, therefore, not to send me or let me go to the ceremony, because I was very young\u2026 It\u2019s part of their attitude towards me when I was a child, [that] I should be kept as unaffected by the world that I was now moving in as possible. So, I went off to my boarding school, and when I came back from making a movie in Hollywood, I went back to boarding school.\n\nAfter Pollyanna, you went on to make more hits like The Parent Trap, before successfully transitioning into adult parts. You\u2019re now in the Off-Broadway play Party Face. Why did you want to continue acting after being a child star?\n\nGosh, I started acting when I was 12, and I was very, very lucky to be in wonderful films, and it set me on a path which I am very grateful for. It wasn\u2019t always clear to me where I should go, and where the path was leading. Once I started becoming an adolescent and then moving into the adulthood and dealing with life on very, very different levels, there were times where it got confusing and I lost my bearings and I didn\u2019t know who I was was or what I should do or what parts I should play or if I should give it up altogether. When my first son was born, I decided that I would give it up, and I didn\u2019t work for over a year, and then a very interesting little movie came along and I went, \u201cOooh I\u2019d love to do that.\u201d\n\nAnd then I brought my then-1-year-old son with me on location, and it was miserable for him. It was in the middle of winter in the north of England, and it rained constantly. He was stuck in the trailer, there was mud up to here [gestures] and [I thought], \u201cWhat am I doing to my little boy?\u201d [Laughs] But this is what I do, and I realized that I\u2019m just, I\u2019m not equipped to do anything else.\n\nI\u2019m very good at being out of work. [Laughs] I\u2019ve got four grandchildren now, and that\u2019s an amazing, fabulous experience, and I can\u2019t wait to see them all again, and the fact that I\u2019m still working at this age is extraordinary, you know? I am so surprised and so grateful that I am still paying the bills by doing this! Every job one does, you learn more and more and more, and of course the irony is that the older one gets and the more experience you\u2019ve had as an actress, the better you get, and the fewer the parts there are to pour all you\u2019ve learned into them\u2026 But, you know, if you\u2019re still reasonably compos mentis and healthy, you have a lot to offer as an actor, so I\u2019m very lucky.\n\nMills is now appearing off-Broadway in Party Face on Stage II at City Center through Apr 8, 2018."}

{"label": true, "txt": "[This story contains spoilers from the finale of the 14th season of ABC's The Bachelorette.]\n\nBecca Kufrin's fiance was revealed during Monday's three-hour finale of The Bachelorette.\n\nThe final episode saw Kufrin \u2014 who was famously jilted by Bachelor Arie Luyendyk Jr. one season prior on the ABC reality franchise \u2014 traveling to the Maldives with her final two men, Garrett Yrigoyen and Blake Horstmann.\n\nAfter winning the coveted first-impression rose on night one, Garrett emerged as the early frontrunner. But as episodes went on, Blake appeared to be catching up and, heading into the finale, possibly even surpassing Garrett. Becca, however, revealed to viewers that she had fallen in love with both men. Ultimately, she accepted a proposal from Garrett, breaking Blake's heart in the process.\n\n\"You've made me know that I can fall in love again, but through all that, because we were so constant, I think I was overlooking other relationships,\" she explained to Blake, after letting him finish nearly all of his planned proposal. \"There's just one piece with somebody else that I'm not ready to say goodbye to yet. Quite honestly, I pictured this moment with you standing here the entire time for so long. I think we could be right and we could be partners, but there's just a better fit for us out there.\"\n\nThe contestant, a 28-year-old sales rep from Denver, was stunned by Becca's decision. \"I didn't expect this. I don't know what to say,\" he replied to her. \"I don't think anyone can make you as happy as I can.\" After breaking down in tears, he said to the camera: \"I can't believe this is happening. I have to go through all of this alone afterwards now \u2014 I fucking knew it. I did love her, I just thought she loved me back.\"\n\nIn a quick turnaround, as is typical for the Bachelorette or Bachelor finale, Becca composed herself for Garrett's arrival. Garrett, a 29-year-old consultant from Reno, arrived to the proposal site, clueless about what had just transpired. \"I love you so much, not just now, but forever. You're my world,\" he said, before getting down on one knee. Becca accepted, giving him her final rose of the competition. \"You reminded me of home and you reminded me of one of the most important men in my life, and that was my dad,\" she said, before finally telling him that she loved him.\n\nThe happy moment marked the end of the 14th cycle of The Bachelorette, but the live postshow, After the Final Rose, welcomed back Becca and Garrett, along with Blake, to reveal details about the road the three faced after ABC put its cameras down in the Maldives in May.\n\nTraditionally, the engaged couple will spend a few days on location before packing their bags and heading home. ABC then sets the star and winner up on clandestine meetings in \"safe\" houses that are secluded from the public and press.\n\nOn the aftershow, ABC aired some behind-the-scenes footage from that time period. \"We still need to get to know each other and to spend that quality time,\" Becca said of their off-air courtship when appearing on After the Final Rose. \"We have just grown so solid in this relationship and I continue to get to know him, but I have loved every second of it.\"\n\nBefore Becca's season began airing, the Bachelorette revealed that she had, in fact, gotten engaged during the finale. Following several Bachelorette stars before her, the 28-year-old publicist announced the outcome without spoiling the name of her finalist. But following the premiere of her season, news broke that Garrett had liked a series of offensive posts on Instagram. The posts mocked different groups of people and raised questions about his character. The events put Becca in a tricky position \u2014 she couldn't reveal that Garrett was the man she was engaged to, and yet she was being dogged by questions about the behavior of her early frontrunner only a few days into her season.\n\nBecca stressed that her viewers should keep an open mind, and then Garrett released a statement taking responsibility for the posts and apologizing for the hurt they caused. The contestant had not been able to give a complete interview going into the finale, which is why Bachelor Nation anticipated that both he and Becca would address the situation now that they could speak freely.\n\nOn Monday's aftershow, Becca admitted that there have been struggles. \"Things have been wonderful, but they've been hard at times,\" she told franchise host Chris Harrison, before letting Garrett take the floor.\n\n\"I'll just take the time now,\" he said. \"Some stuff came out about my social media, and I didn't realize the effect behind a double-tap or a like on Instagram, so I put out an apology. I didn't mean to offend anybody. I apologize for that still, I'm very sorry. I didn't mean to hurt anybody's feelings or do anything like that, so I stand by everything that I posted in my apology.\"\n\nGarrett continued, \"And I'm just trying to grow as a person and be a better person on a daily basis. She's helping me through everything. We've been honest and open and transparent with one another since the beginning, and when that all came out we attacked it because I feel like when I was liking things, it was going against things she stands for, and that made it really hard on us as a couple. So when we started talking about that, we got through that together and we're growing, we're progressing and we're moving forward.\"\n\nOf the stress the situation put on their new relationship, Becca said, \"I got to see who he is, his heart, his soul. The Instagram situation, I don't condone that and I know that he stands by his apology and he feels so bad for everyone that he did offend.\" She continued, \"He didn't mean it. But I just want to move forward, to learn and to grow and continue to educate ourselves. That's all that you can ask for in another person is that somebody who recognizes if they make a mistake and do something wrong and to want to learn and grow from it, and that's what he showed me.\"\n\nGarrett admitted that he worried about the impact on their relationship, but that ultimately Becca \"knew who I was as a person\" and that it made them stronger as a couple, despite the backlash they received. \"[She knew] that I didn't stand behind those likes and that I was a better person than I was presenting on my social media,\" he added.\n\nGoing into the live forum portion of the finale, there was speculation about how much time, if any, would be devoted to the franchise's casting and vetting process, which has been called into question due to the Garrett incident and the later news that another contestant, Lincoln Adim, was convicted of indecent assault and battery after he filmed the show. Another contestant, top-six finalist Leo Dottavio, recently denied sexual harassment claims that were shared by a franchise alum.\n\nWhen speaking to The Hollywood Reporter after the recent taping of the Men Tell All reunion, Becca addressed the off-air controversy with Garrett. THR had spoken to her at the beginning of the season, and one week before the airing of the finale, Becca continued to ask her viewers to keep an open mind. \"I think that living day by day, I handled things how I would want to be treated,\" she told THR at the end of July taping of having no regrets. \"And I really hoped to give the guys any clarity or answers or respect in any given situation, and so overall, I think stayed true to who I was and followed my heart.\"\n\nShe also did admit that reliving the season as it airs has been difficult. \"There are so many things that I'm learning. One thing is just how great of a support system he is, because it\u2019s not always easy watching it back on either end,\" she said. \"And just to have him there to be open and to be receptive to how I handled things and to still have my back means the world,\" adding, \"I was lucky enough to go on this journey with 28 guys and to really get to know them for who they are, away from social media, away from all the distractions, and so that was something special for me that I got to experience, and i just hope that the viewers can be that same way.\"\n\nBlake also appeared on the After the Final Rose special, his first time seeing Becca since their filmed breakup. \"I will always have love for Becca,\" he told Harrison before she came out.\n\nWhen they reunited, he pressed her for answers on what went wrong. \"You had always been so open and present and that last week, to me, it wasn't making the wrong decision, because both of you guys were so amazing, so solid,\" Becca told her runner-up. \"And it was just me trying to sift through our interactions and looking into the future and seeing, what one is going to be the best for me in the long run? How would we handle certain situations if something happened? Where you got more in your head at times about things, it made me worried at times how you would handle things down the road, if someone were to get sick or if something were to happen to a child, and that's when I just started to question the longevity of it.\"\n\nSimilar to how audience reaction to Becca having her heart broken by Arie made her the frontrunner to become the next Bachelorette, the smart money is now on Blake to star on the next season of The Bachelor, which doesn't premiere until January. Joining him as options for the lead ABC gig are Becca's other finalists, Jason Tartick, Colton Underwood and Wills Reid. Both Colton and Wills will appear on Bachelor in Paradise, the summer spinoff that premieres Tuesday night on ABC.\n\nWhat do you think of the Bachelorette finale?

{"label": true, "txt": "The Rock And Jason Statham's Furious Spinoff Landed The Perfect Director By Adam Holmes Random Article Blend Dwayne Johnson's Luke Hobbs and Jason Statham's Deckard Shaw were adversaries during Furious 7, and their feud continued into The Fate of the Furious, but as that latter movie chugged along, the two found themselves working together to bring down Charlize Theron's Cipher. Rather than keep their dynamic going in another of the main Fast and the Furious movies, Universal gave the green light to a spinoff movie starring Hobbs and Shaw, which is reportedly being called... well, Hobbs and Shaw, and now it's official: Deadpool 2 director David Leitch will helm that spinoff. It was reported back in early February that David Leitch was in early talks to direct Hobbs and Shaw, and today EW confirmed that Leitch has officially signed on to the movie. David Leitch spent years in Hollywood as a stuntman/stunt coordinator, but he kicked off his directing career with 2014's John Wick, which he co-helmed with Chad Stahelski. Leitch followed up with Atomic Blonde and next month's Deadpool 2, making Hobbs and Shaw his fourth movie on his directorial resume. He will be working off a script written by Chris Morgan, who has penned all of the Fast and the Furious movies since 2006's Tokyo Drift. The Fast and the Furious franchise has changed quite a bit since it launched in 2001, morphing into movies revolving around street races and heists to its protagonists now often working to save the world. But along with cars, one of the constants in this film series has been action, and with Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham being the stars of Hobbs and Shaw, you need to double down on that particular element. Hiring David Leitch as director is a good step towards ensuring that happens, as he has plenty of experience with stunt-driven action both in front of and behind the camera. While it's reasonable to assume that driving/racing will still factor into this spinoff, given that Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw are two of the best fighters among the main Fast and the Furious characters, one would imagine that means there will be even more throwing down of fisticuffs compared to the main series entries. No plot details for Hobbs and Shaw have been revealed yet, though as with the previous movies, you can count on the spinoff being packed with craziness. When we last saw these two in The Fate of the Furious, they were celebrating with Dom Toretto and the rest of the crew in having successfully Dom's kid and stopped Cipher's plans. However, Cipher eluded capture, so perhaps the spinoff will see Hobbs and Shaw tracking her down, though I suspect there isn't a shortage of other baddies for them to take on. Hobbs and Shaw will race into theaters on July 26, 2019, and so far has no competition that opening weekend, though that will change eventually. Keep checking back with CinemaBlend for more updates about the Fast and the Furious spinoff and the franchise as a whole, and be sure to look through our 2018 release guide to learn what movies are coming out later this year.

{"label": true, "txt": "LOS ANGELES -- A second child actor on the 1980s show \"Charles in Charge\" has accused Scott Baio of sexual misconduct, CBS Los Angeles reports. Alexander Polinsky, 43, who played Adam Powell on the long-running sitcom detailed the allegations in a news conference Wednesday, alongside celebrity attorney Lisa Bloom and fellow \"Charles in Charge\" actress Nicole Eggert in California.\n\n\"I was sexually harassed by Scott Baio and ultimately assaulted by him between the ages of 12 and 15 years old,\" Polinsky told a gathering of reporters.\n\nAt a press conference Wednesday, his spokesman said Baio \"is denying each and every one of the allegations.\"\n\nBrian Glicklich read a brief statement from Baio at a news conference held in response to the latest claim of misconduct.\n\nLast month, Eggert -- who played Jamie Powell on the show -- accused Baio of inappropriately touching her when she was 14 and carrying on an inappropriate sexual relationship with her as a minor.\n\nAccording to Polinsky, during the first season of the show, he walked in on Eggert sitting on Baio's lap. Polinsky said he \"misjudged\" the situation, and when he himself tried to jump in Baio's lap, Baio allegedly shoved him off and called him a gay slur.\n\n\"I saw their relationship develop on the set in the coming months and years, and it was very distressing to me to see a man I looked up to behaving in this way with someone who is very close to my age,\" Polinsky said. \"Scott Baio began a pattern of abuse that was unrelenting.\"\n\nScott Baio speaks on the first day of the RNC on July 18, 2016 in Cleveland.

{"label": true, "txt": "This article is about the baseball player. For others of the same name, see Alex Rodriguez (disambiguation)\n\nAlexander Emmanuel Rodriguez (born July 27, 1975), nicknamed \"A-Rod\", is an American former professional baseball shortstop and third baseman. He played 22 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Seattle Mariners, Texas Rangers, and New York Yankees. Rodriguez began his professional career as one of the sport's most highly touted prospects and is considered one of the greatest baseball players of all time.[1][2][3] Rodriguez amassed a .295 batting average, 696 home runs, over 2,000 runs batted in (RBI), over 2,000 runs scored, and over 3,000 hits. He is a 14-time All-Star and won three American League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, ten Silver Slugger Awards, and two Gold Glove Awards. Rodr\u00edguez is the career record holder for grand slams with 25. He signed two of the most lucrative sports contracts in history, but his career was highly controversial. He incurred criticism from the media for his use of performance-enhancing drugs.[4][5]\n\nThe Mariners selected Rodriguez first overall in the 1993 MLB draft, and he debuted in the major leagues the following year at the age of 18. In 1996, he became the Mariners' starting shortstop, won the major league batting championship, and finished second in voting for the AL MVP Award. His combination of power, speed, and defense made him a cornerstone of the franchise, but he left the team via free agency after the 2000 season to join the Rangers. The 10-year, $252 million contract he signed was the richest in baseball history. He played at a high level in his three years with Texas, highlighted by his first AL MVP Award win in 2003, but the team failed to make the playoffs during his tenure. Prior to the 2004 season, Rodriguez was traded to the Yankees, for whom he converted to a third baseman, because Derek Jeter was already the Yankees' full-time shortstop. During Rodriguez's career with the Yankees, he was named AL MVP in 2005 and 2007. After opting out of his contract following the 2007 season, Rodriguez signed a new 10-year, $275 million deal with the Yankees, extending his record for the sport's most lucrative contract.[6] He became the youngest player ever to hit 500 home runs, reaching the milestone in 2007. He was part of the Yankees' 2009 World Series championship over the Philadelphia Phillies, which was the first year of the new Yankee Stadium and Rodriguez's only world title. Toward the end of his career, Rodriguez was hampered by hip and knee injuries, which caused him to become exclusively a designated hitter.[7] He played his final game in professional baseball on August 12, 2016.\n\nDuring a 2007 interview with Katie Couric on 60 Minutes, Rodriguez denied using performance-enhancing drugs. In February 2009, Rodriguez admitted to using steroids, saying he used them from 2001 to 2003 when playing for Rangers due to \"an enormous amount of pressure\" to perform.[4][5] While recovering from a hip injury in 2013, Rodriguez made headlines by feuding with team management over his rehabilitation and for having allegedly obtained performance-enhancing drugs as part of the Biogenesis baseball scandal. In August 2013, MLB suspended him 211 games for his involvement in the scandal, but he was allowed to play while appealing the punishment.[8] Had the original suspension been upheld, it would have been the longest non-lifetime suspension in Major League Baseball history.[9] After an arbitration hearing, the suspension was reduced to 162 games, which kept him off the field for the entire 2014 season.[10]\n\nAfter retiring as a player, Rodriguez became a media personality, serving as a broadcaster for Fox Sports 1,[11] a cast member of Shark Tank[12] and a member of the ABC News network.[13] In January 2018, ESPN announced that Rodriguez would be joining the broadcast team of Sunday Night Baseball[14] In January 2017, CNBC announced Rodriguez would be the host of the show Back In The Game, where he would help former athletes make a comeback in their personal lives; the first episode debuted on the network in March 2018.[15]\n\nEarly life\n\nRodriguez was born in 1975 in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan to Dominican immigrants Victor and Lourdes Rodriguez.[16] He was raised alongside his two half-siblings, Joe and Suzy, from his mother's first marriage.[17] When he was four years old, the family moved to the Dominican Republic, then to Miami, Florida. Growing up, Rodriguez's favorite baseball players were Keith Hernandez, Dale Murphy, and Cal Ripken Jr., and his favorite team was the New York Mets.[18]\n\nAt the end of Alex's freshman year at Christopher Columbus High School in Miami, he transferred to Westminster Christian School, where he was a star shortstop on the baseball team and played quarterback on the football team.[18] In 100 games he batted .419 with 90 stolen bases. Westminster went on to win the high school national championship in his junior year. He was first team prep All-American as a senior, hitting .505 with nine home runs, 36 runs batted in (RBIs), and 35 stolen bases in 35 attempts in 33 games. He was selected as the USA Baseball Junior Player of the Year and as Gatorade's national baseball student-athlete of the year. In 1993, Rodriguez became the first high school player to ever try out for the United States national baseball team. He was regarded as the top prospect in the country.[19][20]\n\nRodriguez signed a letter of intent to play baseball for Miami of Florida and was also recruited by Miami to play quarterback for its football team. Rodriguez turned down Miami's baseball scholarship offer and never played college baseball, opting instead to sign with the Seattle Mariners after being selected in the first round of the 1993 amateur draft at the age of seventeen.[21]\n\nPlaying career\n\nThe Seattle Mariners selected Rodriguez with the first overall selection of the 1993 Major League Baseball draft.[21] The Mariners signed Rodriguez to a three-year contract worth $1.3 million, and a $1 million signing bonus.[22]\n\nSeattle Mariners\n\n1994\u20131995\n\nIn 1994, Rodriguez made his professional baseball debut as a minor league player with the Appleton Foxes of the Class A Midwest League.[23] He was promoted to the Jacksonville Suns of the Class AA Southern League. He played in 17 games for Jacksonville, and was promoted to the major leagues.[24] On July 8, 1994, Rodriguez was 18 years old when he debuted in the major leagues as a starting shortstop.[25] He was just the third 18-year-old major league shortstop since 1900.[26] He was also the first 18-year-old major league player in 10 years, and the youngest position player in Seattle history.[citation needed] Rodriguez recorded his first major league hit when he singled off of Sergio Valdez on July 9 at Fenway Park.[27] Rodriguez played in 17 games for the Mariners, compiling a .204 batting average, two RBIs, and three stolen bases. The Mariners optioned Rodriguez to the Calgary Cannons of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL) in August.[28][29] In 32 games for Calgary, he had 37 hits in 119 at-bats for a .311 batting average. He also compiled six home runs and 21 RBIs.[30]\n\nRodriguez split most of the 1995 season between the Mariners and the Tacoma Rainiers of the PCL.[31] He connected for his first major league home run off Kansas City's Tom Gordon on June 12. Rodriguez permanently joined the major league roster in August and got his first taste of postseason play, albeit in just two at-bats. Again, he was the youngest player in Major League Baseball.[citation needed] During the 1995 season, Rodriguez played in 48 games, batting .232 with 5 home runs, 19 RBI, and 4 stolen bases.\n\n1996\u20131997\n\nThe following year, Rodriguez took over as the Mariners' regular shortstop and led the American League (AL) with a .358 batting average, the highest for an AL right-handed batter since Joe DiMaggio hit .381 in 1939 and the 3rd highest ever for a shortstop. He also had 36 home runs with 123 RBIs.[32] At 21 years and one month, he was the 3rd youngest AL batting leader ever behind Al Kaline (20) in 1955 and Ty Cobb (20) in 1907, and the 3rd youngest player in history with 35+ homers. He was also the first major league shortstop to win a batting title since 1960, and the first in the AL since 1944. At age 20 years, 11 months, he was the youngest shortstop in All-Star Game history. He also led the AL in runs (141), total bases (379), and doubles (54) and ranked among the league leaders in base hits (2nd, 215), extra base hits (2nd, 91), multi-hit games (3rd, 65), slugging (4th, .631), RBI (8th, 123), and on-base percentage (8th, .414). Rodriguez posted the highest totals ever for a shortstop in runs, hits, doubles, extra base hits, and slugging, and tied most total bases, and established Seattle club records for average, runs, hits, doubles, and total bases, in a season that statistical analysts consider the best ever by a shortstop.[33]\n\nThe Sporting News and Associated Press selected Rodriguez as their Major League Player of the Year. He finished second to Juan Gonz\u00e1lez in balloting for the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award. He finished three points behind Gonz\u00e1lez (290\u2013287), matching the second closest AL MVP voting in history.[34]\n\nIn 1997, Rodriguez batted .300 with 23 home runs and 84 RBIs. He hit for the cycle on June 5,[35] becoming the second Mariner, and at 21 years, 10 months, the fifth youngest player in history, to accomplish the feat. He was the fan's choice to start the All-Star Game at shortstop for the AL team, becoming the first player other than Ripken to start at shortstop in 13 years. It was the first All-Star start of his career and his second All-Star Game in two years.[36]\n\n1998\u20132000\n\nRodriguez rebounded in 1998, when he set the AL record for homers by a shortstop and became just the third member of the 40\u201340 club, (with 42 home runs and 46 stolen bases) and one of just 3 shortstops in history to hit 40 home runs in a season. His 43.9 Power-speed number was, through at least 2008, the highest single season Power/Speed Number ever.[37] He was selected as Players Choice AL Player of the Year,[38] won his second Silver Slugger Award,[39] and finished ninth in the MVP voting.[40]\n\nIn 1999, Rodriguez had a .310 average, 42 home runs, and 111 RBIs,[25] despite missing over 30 games with an injury and playing the second half of the season at Safeco Field,[41] a considerably less hitter-friendly ballpark than the Kingdome.[42] At the time, he was the youngest-ever player to record 100 home runs and 100 stolen bases, at 23 years and 309 days of age.[43] In April 2015, Mike Trout reached the same milestone at 23 years and 253 days old.[43]\n\nRodriguez entered 2000 as the cornerstone player of the Mariners franchise,[citation needed] which had recently traded superstars Randy Johnson and Ken Griffey Jr.[44] Rodriguez put up great numbers as the team's remaining superstar, hitting 41 HR with 132 RBIs and a .316 batting average.[25] He set a career high for walks (100) and became the only shortstop to have 100 runs, RBI, and walks in the same season.[45] He hit well in the playoffs as well (.409 batting average and .773 slugging percentage),[25] but Seattle lost to the New York Yankees in the 2000 American League Championship Series.[46] He was selected as the Major League Player of the Year by Baseball America and finished third in the AL MVP voting.[47]\n\nTexas Rangers\n\nRodriguez became a free agent after the 2000 season. He eventually signed with the Texas Rangers, who had fallen to last place in their division in 2000. The contract was at the time the most lucrative contract in sports history: a 10-year deal worth $252 million. The deal was worth $63 million more than the second-richest baseball deal.[48] The contract was highly criticized, because it tied up valuable payroll space that could have been spent to improve other areas, such as pitching.[49][50]\n\nIn an article written eight years later, Rodriguez said he regretted signing with the Texas Rangers and wished he had signed with the New York Mets instead, and that he had heeded the advice of his agent, Scott Boras. (See Opt out controversy).[51]\n\n2001\u20132002\n\nRodriguez's power hitting numbers improved with his move to the Texas Rangers. In his first season there, Rodriguez produced one of the top offensive seasons ever for a shortstop, leading the American League with 52 HR, 133 runs scored, and 393 total bases.[25] He became the first player since 1932 with 50 homers and 200 hits in a season, just the third shortstop to ever lead the league in homers, and was just the second AL player in the last 34 seasons (beginning 1968) to lead the league in runs, homers, and total bases; his total base figure is the most ever for a major league shortstop. His 52 homers made him the sixth youngest to ever reach 50 homers and were the highest total ever by a shortstop, surpassing Ernie Banks' record of 47 in 1958, and also the most ever for an infielder other than a 1st baseman, breaking Phillies 3B Mike Schmidt's mark of 48 in 1980.[52] It was his 5th 30-homer campaign, tying Banks for most ever by a shortstop. He also tied for the league lead in extra-base hits (87) and ranked third in RBIs (135) and slugging (.622). He was also among the AL leaders in hits (4th, 201), average (7th, .318), and on-base percentage (8th, .399). He established Rangers club records for homers, runs, total bases, and hit by pitches, had the 2nd most extra-base hits, and the fourth-highest RBI total. He led the club in runs, hits, doubles (34), homers, RBI, slugging, and on-base percentage and was second in walks (75), stolen bases (18), and game-winning RBI (14) while posting career highs for homers, RBI, and total bases. Rodriguez started 161 games at shortstop and one as the DH, the only major league player to start all of his team's games in 2001.\n\nRodriguez followed the previous year with a major league-best 57 HR, 142 RBIs and 389 total bases in 2002,[25] becoming the first player to lead the majors in all three categories since 1984. His nine home runs in April matched a team record that was shared (through 2008) with Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez (2000), Carl Everett (2003), and Ian Kinsler (2007). He had the 6th-most home runs in AL history, the most since Roger Maris' league record 61 in 1961 and the most ever for a shortstop for the 2nd straight year. He won the Babe Ruth Home Run Award for leading MLB in homers that season.[53] He also won his first Gold Glove Award, awarded for outstanding defense.\n\nHis 109 home runs in 2001\u201302 are the most ever by an American League right-handed batter in consecutive seasons. However, the Rangers finished last in the AL Western division in both years, a showing that likely cost Rodriguez the MVP award in 2002 when he finished second to fellow shortstop Miguel Tejada, whose 103-win Oakland A's won the same division.\n\n2003\n\nThe 2003 season was Rodriguez' last year with the Rangers. He led the American League in home runs, runs scored, and slugging percentage, and won his second consecutive Gold Glove Award. He also led the league in fewest at-bats per home run (12.9) and became the youngest player to hit 300 homers. He was tied with Jim Thome for the MLB lead in homers, and he won his second Babe Ruth Home Run Award.[54][55]\n\nFollowing five top-10 finishes in the AL MVP voting between 1996 and 2002, Rodriguez won his first MVP trophy. Rodriguez, a two-time runner up in the balloting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America, joined outfielder Andre Dawson from the 1987 Chicago Cubs as the only players to play on last-place teams and win the award.[56]\n\nFollowing the 2003 season, Texas set out to part ways with Rodriguez and his expensive contract. The Rangers initially agreed to a trade with the Boston Red Sox, sending Rodriguez to Boston for Manny Ramirez, 19-year old pitching prospect Jon Lester, and cash considerations. However, the Major League Baseball Players Association vetoed the deal because it called for a voluntary reduction in salary by Rodriguez.[57] Despite the failed deal with the Red Sox, the Rangers named him team captain during that off-season.[58]\n\nNew York Yankees\n\nRodriguez took over at third base after he was traded to the Yankees in 2004.\n\nYankees third baseman Aaron Boone suffered a knee injury while playing a game of pickup basketball that sidelined him for the entire 2004 season, creating a hole at third base.[59]\n\nOn February 15, 2004, the Rangers traded Rodriguez to the New York Yankees for second baseman Alfonso Soriano and a player to be named later (Joaqu\u00edn \u00c1rias was sent to the Rangers on March 24). The Rangers also agreed to pay $67 million of the $179 million left on Rodriguez's contract. Rodriguez agreed to switch positions from shortstop to third base, paving the way for the trade, because the popular Derek Jeter was already entrenched at shortstop. Rodriguez also had to switch uniform numbers, from 3 to 13; he had worn 3 his entire career, but that number is retired by the Yankees in honor of Babe Ruth. This was only the second time in MLB history that a reigning MVP was traded, with the first coming in 1914 when Eddie Collins was traded to the Chicago White Sox from the Philadelphia Athletics for cash considerations.[60]\n\n2004\n\nDuring his first season with the Yankees, Rodriguez hit .286 with 36 home runs, 106 RBIs, 112 runs scored and 28 stolen bases.[25] He became one of only three players in Major League history to compile at least 35 home runs, 100 runs and 100 RBIs in seven consecutive seasons, joining Hall of Famers Babe Ruth and Jimmie Foxx. The 112 runs marked the ninth straight season in which he scored at least 100 runs, the longest such streak in the Major Leagues since Hank Aaron did it in 13 straight seasons from 1955 to 1967, and the longest in the American League since Mickey Mantle did it also in nine straight seasons from 1953 to 1961. During the 2004 season, he also became the youngest player ever to reach the 350 HR mark and the third youngest to reach the 1,000 RBI plateau. He was elected to the 2004 American League All-Star Team, the eighth All-Star selection of his career and the first as a third baseman. On July 24, 2004, Rodriguez was hit by a pitch from Bronson Arroyo, which led to a scuffle with Boston Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek, and a bench-clearing brawl between both teams. On defense, he had the lowest range factor among non-platoon AL third basemen (2.39) in his first year at the position.[61] He finished 14th in balloting for the AL MVP Award.[citation needed]\n\nIn the 2004 ALDS, Rodriguez was a dominant hitter against the Minnesota Twins, batting .421 and slugging .737 while delivering two key extra-inning hits. Following the series win, Rodriguez's first season with the Yankees culminated in a dramatic playoff series against the team he had almost ended up playing for: the Yankees' bitter rival, the Boston Red Sox. In that series (ALCS) he equaled the single-game post-season record with five runs scored in Game 3 at Boston.\n\nOne of the most controversial plays of Rodriguez's career occurred late in Game 6 of the 2004 American League Championship Series. With one out and Derek Jeter on first base in the bottom of the eighth inning, Rodriguez hit a slow roller between the pitcher's mound and the first base line. Red Sox pitcher Bronson Arroyo fielded the ball and ran towards Rodriguez to apply a tag. As Arroyo reached towards him, Rodriguez swatted at his glove, knocking the ball loose. As the ball rolled away, Jeter scored all the way from first as Rodriguez took second on the play, which was initially ruled an error on Arroyo. However, the umpires quickly huddled, then ruled that Rodriguez was out for interference. Jeter was sent back to first base, and his run was nullified.[62] The Yankees would then lose the ALCS to the eventual World Series champion Red Sox after leading the series 3 games to none.\n\n2005\u20132006\n\nIn 2005, Rodriguez hit .321, leading the American League with 124 runs and 48 HR while driving in 130 runs.[25] He became the first Yankee to win the American League home run title since Reggie Jackson (41) in 1980. He also became one of only two players in Major League history to compile at least 35 home runs, 100 runs and 100 RBIs in eight consecutive seasons (Jimmie Foxx accomplished the feat in nine straight seasons from 1932 to 1940). Rodriguez established the franchise record for most home runs in a single season by a right-handed batter (broke Joe DiMaggio's mark of 46 in 1937). His 47 HR from the third base position are a single-season American League record. Rodriguez hit 26 home runs at Yankee Stadium in 2005, establishing the single-season club record for right-handed batters (previously held by DiMaggio in 1937 and Gary Sheffield in 2004). On June 8, at 29 years, 316 days old, he became the youngest player in MLB history to reach the 400 HR mark. 2005 also marked the tenth straight season that Rodriguez scored at least 100 runs. On defense, however, he had the lowest range factor in the league at third for the second straight season (2.62).[63]\n\nOn April 26, Rodriguez hit three home runs off Angels' pitcher Bartolo Col\u00f3n and drove in 10 runs. The 10 RBIs were the most by a Yankee since Tony Lazzeri established the franchise and American League record with 11 on May 24, 1936. Rodriguez became the 11th major leaguer to accomplish the feat.[64] Rodriguez won his second AL MVP Award in three seasons.\n\nThe \"League Award\" was the precursor to the MVP. Rodriguez became the fifth player to win this award with two different teams, joining Mickey Cochrane, Jimmie Foxx, Frank Robinson and Barry Bonds. Rodriguez was also named the shortstop on the Major League Baseball Latino Legends Team in 2005.\n\nRodriguez reacting to a called strike in a game against Tampa Bay\n\nPrior to the season, Rodriguez opted to play for Team USA in the World Baseball Classic.[65]\n\nRodriguez was again an All-Star in 2006. His 2,000th hit, on July 21, 2006 \u2212 six days prior to his 31st birthday \u2212 was also his 450th home run. Rodriguez became the youngest player in baseball history to reach 450 home runs (surpassing Ken Griffey, Jr., by 267 days), and the eighth player to reach 2,000 hits before turning 31. Ty Cobb reached the mark while still 29, while Rogers Hornsby, Mel Ott, Hank Aaron, Joe Medwick, Jimmie Foxx, and Robin Yount all achieved their 2,000th hit at age 30. All seven are members of baseball's Hall of Fame.\n\nFor the season, Rodriguez finished fourth in the league in RBI (121), fifth in runs scored (113), eighth in home runs (35) and walks (90), and ninth in OBP (.392). He also led all AL third basemen in errors, with 24, and had the lowest fielding percentage (.937) and \u2013 for the third straight season \u2013 range factor (2.50) among them.[25] Rodriguez also became the second player in Major League history to record at least 35 home runs, 100 runs, and 100 RBIs in nine consecutive seasons, joining Foxx. It was Rodriguez's 11th consecutive season with more than 100 runs scored, the longest such streak in American League history since Lou Gehrig did so in 13 straight seasons (1926\u201338). Despite this success, it was perceived as one of his lesser-accomplished seasons and was harshly criticized throughout the 2006 season. He has commented that 2006 was his most difficult season as a professional.[66]\n\n2007\n\nWhen Rodriguez reported to camp in 2007, he had reduced his body fat from 16% the year before to 9%. He made light of this fact during a Late Show with David Letterman sketch that was filmed during Spring training, which featured him shirtless being rubbed down with suntan lotion. He revealed to the press that he and Jeter were no longer close friends.[67] Rodriguez also reduced his high leg kick at the plate, increasing his bat speed, making him less-apt to strike out and a more dangerous hitter.[68]\n\nIn the Yankees' fourth game of the season, Rodriguez hit two home runs against the Baltimore Orioles at Yankee Stadium, including his 14th-career grand slam to end the game. The walk-off grand slam was the third of his career, tying the major league mark for game-ending grand slams shared by Vern Stephens and Cy Williams.[69][70] Rodriguez also began the season by becoming the ninth major leaguer\u2014and first Yankee\u2014to hit six home runs in the first seven games of the season. Rodriguez also became the first Yankee to hit seven home runs in the first ten games of the season.[71]\n\nOn April 23, Rodriguez became the first player in major league history to hit 14 home runs in a span of 18 games, and also tied the MLB record for most home runs in April. His total of 34 RBIs in April was one short of Juan Gonz\u00e1lez' AL and MLB record.[citation needed] In a game against the Toronto Blue Jays on May 30, Rodriguez sparked controversy when he shouted during a routine play and an infielder let a pop fly drop, costing the Blue Jays three runs. The Yankees went on to win the game, 10\u20135.[72] On July 12, Rodriguez hit his 150th career home run in a Yankees uniform. This made him the first, and so far only, player in major league history to ever hit 150 home runs for three different teams.[73] He became the third player to hit at least 100 home runs for three teams, following Reggie Jackson and Darrell Evans.[74]\n\nRodriguez hit his 500th career home run against pitcher Kyle Davies of the Kansas City Royals on August 4. Rodriguez became the youngest player ever to reach 500 homers (32 years, 8 days).[75] On September 25, Rodriguez became the fifth Major League player to record a 50-home run, 150-RBI season when he hit a grand slam.[76]\n\nRodriguez batting in 2007\n\nIn 2007, Rodriguez became the first player in major league history to have at least 35 home runs, 100 runs, and 100 RBIs in 10 consecutive seasons, surpassing Jimmie Foxx (9 consecutive seasons). He led the AL in home runs (54), RBIs (156), slugging percentage (.645), OPS (1.067), total bases (376), and times on base (299), and was 2nd in hit by pitch (21), extra base hits (85), and at bats per home run (10.8), 4th in on-base percentage (.422) and sacrifice flies (9), 7th in walks (95) and plate appearances (708), 8th in intentional walks (11), and 9th in games (158).[25] He led MLB in home runs and won his third Babe Ruth Home Run Award.[77]\n\nAfter the season, Rodriguez was named the AL MVP for the third time in his career, receiving 26 first-place votes out of a possible 28.[78] He also won the Silver Slugger Award for his position,[79] the Players Choice Award for Outstanding AL Player, and the Players Choice Award for Player of the Year.[citation needed]\n\nOpt-out controversy\n\nThe 2007 season marked the last year of Rodriguez's 10-year, $252 million contract before he opted out and became a free agent again. Rodriguez had repeatedly stated during the 2007 season that he would like to remain a Yankee for the rest of his career.[80] On October 28, 2007, Rodriguez's agent, Scott Boras, announced that he would not renew his contract with the Yankees citing that he \"was unsure of the future composition\" of the team. He received a slew of criticism from fans and writers alike not only for opting out, but also for not meeting with Yankee management before he did. He was further criticized for the timing of his announcement, during the eighth inning of Game Four of the World Series, as the Boston Red Sox were wrapping up their victory over the Colorado Rockies; even MLB's chief operating officer, Bob DuPuy, called it an attempt by Boras to \"try to put his selfish interests and that of one individual player above the overall good of the game.\"[81]\n\nTeammate Mariano Rivera convinced Rodriguez to contact the New York Yankees ownership.[82] He contacted them directly, bypassing Boras (Boras also apologized for the timing of the announcement). Subsequently, Rodriguez issued a statement on his website, saying that he wished to stay with the Yankees.[83] On November 15, 2007, the New York Yankees and Rodriguez agreed on the \"basic framework\" of a 10-year, $275 million contract that would have him playing until he is 42.[84] The contract, finalized December 13, includes various multimillion-dollar incentives for breaking career home run milestones.[85]\n\n2008\n\nRodriguez at bat in 2008\n\nRodriguez hit his 549th home run in a September 3, 2008 game against the Tampa Bay Rays. The opposing manager objected that the ball was foul, and for the first time in MLB history, instant replay (a process officially introduced a few days earlier) was used to review the play and uphold the umpires' ruling.[86] He was one of only four batters in the AL to have at least 18 home runs and 18 stolen bases in both 2007 and 2008, along with Torii Hunter, Ian Kinsler, and Grady Sizemore. Rodriguez hit a home run every 14.6 at-bats in 2008, the second best ratio on the team behind Jason Giambi.[87] Rodriguez played 138 games during the 2008 season with a .302 average, 35 home runs, 103 RBI, and an AL best .573 slugging percentage.\n\nEarly 2009: Report of positive test for steroids\n\nOn February 7, 2009, Sports Illustrated reported that Rodriguez tested positive for testosterone and the anabolic steroid Primobolan in 2003.[88] Rodriguez's name appears on a government-sealed list of 104 major-league players (out of 1200 tested[89]) who came up positive for performance-enhancing drugs. The report was compiled as part of Major League Baseball's 2003 survey to see whether mandatory random drug testing program might be necessary. At the time, there was no penalty or punishment for a positive steroid test. Rodriguez did not immediately confirm the allegations, deferring at first to the players' union.[88][90] Two days after the allegations, Rodriguez admitted to steroid use from 2001 until 2003, claiming that he ceased using such substances after spring training that year.[4][5]\n\n2009 regular season\n\nPrior to the 2009 season, Rodriguez was scheduled to represent the Dominican Republic in the 2009 World Baseball Classic, but he was forced to withdraw when an MRI revealed a cyst in his right hip. When he went to have the cyst drained, it was discovered that he was also suffering from a torn labrum in the same hip. Rodriguez opted to undergo an arthroscopic procedure with a recovery period of six to nine weeks, instead of the usual three to four months.[91] Although the procedure should have allowed him to make it through the season without any complications, he required a second, more extensive surgery in the off-season.[91]\n\nAfter missing spring training and the first month of the season, Rodriguez returned to the Yankees in a May 8 game against the Baltimore Orioles and hit a three-run home run on the first pitch of his first at-bat. The Yankees had stumbled to a 13\u201315 record in Rodriguez' absence, and his return fortified the lineup and provided much-needed protection for three-hole hitter Mark Teixeira, who was a notoriously slow starter. Rodriguez also supplied some late-game heroics. On May 16, his two-run walk-off home run in the bottom of the eleventh inning gave the Yankees a 6\u20134 win over the Minnesota Twins. One week later, he hit a game-tying solo home run in the bottom of the ninth off Philadelphia Phillies closer Brad Lidge in a game the Yankees would go on to win, 5\u20134.\n\nBy early June, the Yankees had surged to first place in the AL East. The club's fortunes changed later in the month, when Rodriguez fell into a slump that saw his batting average plummet as the Yankees fell to second place. On June 23, Rodriguez became the eighth active player to reach 8,000 career at-bats in the seventh inning of the Yankees and Braves game.[92] On June 25, Rodriguez belted homer 563 of his career, off Atlanta Braves starter Derek Lowe, and tying Reggie Jackson for 11th on the all-time home run list.[93] On June 26, Rodriguez surpassed Jackson for 11th on the all-time home run list, against the New York Mets in the Subway Series,[94] and against the Angels on July 11, Rodriguez passed Rafael Palmeiro for 10th place;[95] it was his 65th home run against Anaheim, the most by any active player against an opponent.\n\nOn October 4, 2009, during the final game of the season, Rodriguez hit two home runs in the sixth inning that drove in seven runs, setting an American League record for most RBI by a batter in a single inning, and giving him his 12th consecutive season, 13 overall, of reaching 30 home runs and 100 RBIs, breaking a tie with Manny Ramirez, Babe Ruth and Jimmie Foxx for the most in MLB history.[96]\n\n2009 postseason\n\nDating back to Game 4 of the 2004 AL Championship Series, Rodriguez had batted with 38 runners on base over a span of 61 postseason at-bats. He stranded every one of them, going 0-for-29 with runners on base.[97] However, in the first game of the 2009 ALDS against Minnesota, he hit two RBI singles \u2212 both coming with two outs. In Game 2, he hit an RBI single in the sixth, and hit a game-tying homer off closer Joe Nathan in the bottom of the ninth inning. In Game 3, he again hit a game-tying home run. In the ALCS, Rodriguez hit his third game-tying HR of the postseason in Game 2 in the bottom of the 11th against Angels closer Brian Fuentes.[98] For the series, he batted 9\u201321 (.429) with three home runs and six runs batted in.\n\nThe Yankees faced the Phillies in the World Series. In Game 3, Rodriguez hit what appeared to be a double off a camera perched atop the outfield wall, but after protest by Yankee manager Joe Girardi, the play was reviewed and ruled a home run. In Game 4, Rodriguez drove in the go-ahead run with two outs in the 9th inning off closer Brad Lidge. The Yankees would go on to win the game 7\u20134 to take a 3-games-to-1 lead in the series. Despite a 2\u20134 performance with three RBI in Game 5, the Yankees lost 8\u20136 to force the Series to return to the Bronx for Game 6. Rodriguez was 1\u20132 with 2 walks and two runs scored in Game 6, as the Yankees went on to defeat the Phillies 7\u20133 for their 27th World Series Championship, the first of Rodriguez's career. Having reversed his postseason misfortunes, he was the Babe Ruth Award winner as the 2009 postseason MVP,[99] in which he batted .365 with six home runs and 18 RBI.[100]\n\n2010\u20132012\n\nOn August 4, 2010, on the 3-year anniversary of his 500th home run, Rodriguez became the seventh player in major league history to hit 600 home runs, hitting number 600 off Shaun Marcum of the Toronto Blue Jays, becoming the youngest player to do so at 35 years and 8 days old. On August 14, Rodriguez hit three home runs in a game against the Kansas City Royals. In the top of the 6th, he hit his first, a solo dinger to left center. In the top of the 7th, he hit his second, a two-run shot to dead center. In the top of the 9th, he hit his third, a towering two-run blast into the waterfall in Kauffman Stadium.[101] On September 6, he recorded his 100th RBI; it was the 14th year he had reached the mark, the most times of any player in baseball history. On Sep 29, he hit his 30th home run of the season, recording his major league record 13th straight year of at least 30 home runs and 100 RBIs, breaking a tie with Jimmie Foxx, who had 12 seasons.\n\nIn 2011, Rodriguez batted .295 with 13 home runs and 52 RBIs prior to the All-Star break. Despite good production, Rodriguez suffered his longest single season home run drought of his career by not hitting one in 85 at-bats. Although elected to start the game, Rodriguez opted for arthroscopic surgery on his knee to repair a torn meniscus that impacted his power, and was placed on the disabled list.[102] On top of recovery, Rodriguez was facing serious allegations that he participated in illegal, underground poker games. One of those games reportedly turned violent and cocaine was openly used. However, Rodriguez denied through a representative that he ever participated in illegal poker games. An MLB Executive has said that if Rodriguez was indeed proven guilty, he may face a suspension; MLB had warned Rodriguez in 2005 not to participate in such games.[103]\n\nRodriguez returned to the Yankees on August 21, playing third base against the Minnesota Twins, going 0-for-4. He sustained another injury with a jammed thumb while trying to make a play in that game. He returned to the Yankees on August 25, going 2-for-4 with 2 singles in a win for the Yankees over the Oakland Athletics. On August 26, Rodriguez hit his first home run since coming off the disabled list, a solo shot off Baltimore Orioles pitcher Tommy Hunter. He concluded the season with 16 home runs and 62 RBIs in 99 games, ending his major league-record streak of 13 straight seasons of 30 homers and 100 RBIs.[104]\n\nRodriguez hit his 23rd career grand slam off Atlanta Braves relief pitcher Jonny Venters on June 12, 2012, which tied Lou Gehrig for the most in MLB history.[105] In a road loss versus the Seattle Mariners on July 24, 2012, Rodriguez took a hit to the hand during an eighth inning at bat versus Seattle starting pitcher F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez. The injury was later described as a non-displaced fracture.[106] Rodriguez was placed on the disabled list. Earlier in the same game, Hernandez struck out Rodriguez in the sixth inning, making Rodriguez the fifth player to record 2,000 career strikeouts in MLB history.[106]\n\nDuring the 2012 postseason, Rodriguez was removed for a pinch hitter multiple times and did not start many times. He batted 3-for-25 overall, and went 0-for-18 with 12 strikeouts against right-handed pitchers.[107] He batted .111 in the 2012 ALCS.[108] The Yankees were eliminated by the Tigers in the 2012 ALCS.\n\n2013\n\nRodriguez playing for the Trenton Thunder , the Yankees' AA affiliate, in 2013\n\nOn January 16, 2013, Rodriguez underwent arthroscopic surgery in his hip to repair a torn labrum. It was the second time in four years that he had the surgery, although this operation was more serious than before. Rodriguez began the 2013 season on the 60-day disabled list.[109]\n\nWhile rehabilitating his hip, Rodriguez was embroiled in a series of negative headlines: he became a central figure of the Biogenesis baseball scandal and MLB's investigation into his possible connection to performance-enhancing drugs;[110] additionally, after Rodriguez announced on Twitter that his doctor had medically cleared him to play in games, Yankees general manager Brian Cashman soon revealed that Rodriguez's doctor did not have such authority to clear him.[111]\n\nRodriguez played his first rehab assignment game on July 2, 2013 with the Yankees Class-A Low affiliate, the Charleston RiverDogs.[112] He continued his rehabilitation and played for the Yankees Triple-A team, the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders on July 18.[113] Two days prior to his scheduled promotion to the major league roster, Rodriguez sustained a new injury, as an MRI later revealed a Grade 1 quad strain, delaying his return and forcing him to continue rehabilitating in the minor leagues. Rodriguez independently sought a second opinion on his quad strain on July 24 with a doctor who stated that there did not appear to be an injury; the Yankees front office was further upset by his decision, claiming that he violated league rules for seeking a second opinion without the team's permission.[114] He completed his rehabilitation program with the Yankees' Double-A affiliate Trenton Thunder.[115]\n\nRodriguez made his 2013 return with the Yankees on August 5, which was the same day that MLB announced he would be suspended\u2014pending an appeal\u2014 through the 2014 season for his role in the Biogenesis scandal.[116] On August 11, Rodriguez hit his first home run of the season off Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander.[117] With the home run, Rodriguez passed Stan Musial for fifth place in career RBIs.[118] Rodriguez continued to feud with Yankees management following his return, as his lawyers accused the team, and specifically Christopher S. Ahmad, of mishandling his hip injury in several ways; Rodriguez's legal team contended that the team withheld the injury from him and continued to play him in 2012, despite his health, and that team president Randy Levine told Rodriguez's hip surgeon that he would feel elated if Rodriguez never played again.[119] In response to the accusations, Cashman said, \"I'm not comfortable talking to Alex about this because we feel we are in a litigious environment. Hello and goodbye, that's about it.\" He added, \"It's not just Yankees' management. He's putting it at the level of our trainers, our medical staff. The organization. The team.\"[120]\n\nDuring a game against the Red Sox on August 18, 2013, Rodriguez was involved in key moments against Ryan Dempster. The first time he faced Dempster, Rodriguez was hit by a pitch on a 3-0 count, leading to home plate umpire Brian O'Nora warning both benches and ejecting Girardi, while Dempster was allowed to stay in the game. Later in the top of the 6th inning, Rodriguez hit a 442-foot home run to straightway center off Dempster. The Yankees won 9-6, and Dempster, who hit Rodriguez before, was suspended 5 games by the MLB with an undisclosed fine (although he did not miss a start).\n\nOn September 20, at Yankee Stadium, Rodriguez hit his 24th career grand slam, an opposite field 654th career home run, off George Kontos of the San Francisco Giants, breaking the all-time grand slam record, formerly held by Lou Gehrig.[121] For the 2013 season, Rodriguez played in only 44 games batting .244 with 7 home runs and 19 RBI.\n\n2014\n\nRodriguez's suspension that was announced the previous season but delayed pending an appeal, was upheld for the entirety of the 2014 regular season and postseason. He was found to have violated the league's Performance Enhancing Drugs policy, specifically through the \"use and possession of numerous forms of prohibited performance-enhancing substances, including Testosterone and human Growth Hormone, over the course of multiple years\" and \"attempting to cover-up his violations of the Program by engaging in a course of conduct intended to obstruct and frustrate the Office of the Commissioner's investigation.\"[122] At the end of the 2014 season, Brian Cashman announced that Rodriguez would no longer serve as an everyday third baseman after the team's signing of Chase Headley, and would instead become a designated hitter.[7]\n\n2015\n\nIn the off-season, during the week of January 19, 2015, it was reported that Rodriguez met with new Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred, resulting in a \"positive discussion, lasting 10 minutes in which Rodriguez apologized, while promising to behave in the future\".[123] On February 17, 2015, Rodriguez issued a hand-written letter of apology to \"Major League Baseball, the Yankees, the Steinbrenner family, the Players Association and you, the fans\".[124]\n\nRodriguez reported to New York Yankees' 2015 spring training camp three days early.[125][126][127] Girardi planned to play Rodriguez at first base during spring training to assess whether he could be played there, a first for his career.[128][129]\n\nRodriguez played his first game after his suspension on opening day against the Blue Jays at Yankee Stadium. He served as the designated hitter, going 1 for 2 with a walk as the Yankees lost to the Blue Jays 1\u20136.[130] On April 17, his first multi-HR game \u2013 and third and fourth home runs \u2013 of the season included a blast off Nate Karns of Tampa Bay that traveled 471 feet (144 m), providing four total RBIs in a 5\u20134 win.[131] In a pinch-hit appearance against the Red Sox on May 1, Rodriguez hit his 660th career home run off reliever Junichi Tazawa, tying Willie Mays for fourth place on the all-time home run list.[132] On May 7, Rodriguez hit his 661st career home run off Orioles pitcher Chris Tillman for sole possession of fourth place on the all-time home run list.[133] On May 27, Rodriguez set an AL record for the most career RBI, passing Lou Gehrig, also moving him into third on the all-time list.[134]\n\nWith his 666th career home run against Bud Norris of the Orioles on June 13, Rodriguez drove in his 2,000th and 2,001st career runs. However, opinions varied on whether he was the second (Elias Sports Bureau, trailing Aaron), third (MLB, trailing Aaron and Ruth),[135] or fourth player (Baseball-Reference.com, trailing Aaron, Ruth, and Cap Anson) in MLB history to attain 2,000 RBIs.[136] Rodriguez' next home run was also his 3,000th career hit, making him the 29th player to reach the milestone. He hit it against the Tigers' Justin Verlander in a 7\u20132 win, joining Wade Boggs and Jeter \u2013 both former Yankees \u2013 as the only players to hit a home run for his 3,000th hit.[137] With his next hit on June 20, Rodriguez surpassed Roberto Clemente, the eleventh player in MLB history to have recorded 3000 hits.[138] On July 25, against the Twins in Minnesota, and two days before his 40th birthday, Rodr\u00edguez became the fifth-oldest player to hit three home runs in one game.[139]\n\nIn his first 95 games of the season, Rodriguez hit 24 homers and produced an OPS of .930.[140] After being mired in a 72-at-bat slump without a home run until August 18 against the Twins, he hit his 25th home run which was also his 25th career grand slam, extending his major league record. The home run also drove in the go-ahead runs for an 8\u20134 Yankees win.[141]\n\nRodriguez with the Yankees in 2016\n\nFrom August 1 until the end of the season, Rodriguez appeared in 56 games, batting .191, .678 OPS, nine home runs, and struck out 59 times in 183 at-bats.[140] The first base experiment yielded two total appearances in 2015.[142] He finished with 33 home runs, 86 RBI, 131 hits, and a .252 batting average. He led the Yankees in home runs, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, on-base plus slugging, and bases-on-balls. Rodriguez reached 30+ home runs for the 15th time in his career, tying Aaron for the most 30-home-run seasons in history.[143]\n\n2016\n\nOn April 17, 2016, Rodriguez became the 19th player to make 12,000 career plate appearances. On May 4, the Yankees placed him on the 15-day disabled list due to a right hamstring strain.[144] On May 24, the Yankees sent him on a rehab assignment to the Double-A Trenton Thunder,[145] and activated him on May 26.[146] The next day, he hit his 30th career home run at Tropicana Field, which traveled an estimated 440 feet (130 m), as the Yankees defeated Tampa Bay, 4\u20131.[147] However, for much of the season, Rodriguez notably struggled to adequately produce, enduring prolonged slumps as his role dwindled from everyday designated hitter to pinch hitter. In July, he had two extra base hits, including his 696th career home run.[148]\n\nAt a press conference held on August 7, Rodriguez announced that he would play in his final game for the Yankees on the following Friday, August 12, against the Rays at Yankee Stadium. It was also noted that the Yankees would sign him to a new contract that would keep him in the organization through 2017 as a special instructor and advisor. In the offseason, Rodriguez would join the Yankees' front office as a special advisor.[149] The club commemorated Rodriguez's final game as a Yankee, thanking him in front of a sold-out crowd for his efforts with a tribute of highlights on the stadium videoboard, a presentation of a framed number 13 jersey, and a base autographed by teammates.[150][151] This was in stark contrast to the year-long farewell tour given to his former Yankee teammate Derek Jeter. At the plate, he batted third and started as the designated hitter, going 1-for-4 with an RBI double. In the ninth inning, he was brought onto the field at third base for one batter \u2212 his only defensive appearance for the Yankees in 2016[152] \u2212 and departed the field to a \"raucous ovation\" from the fans.[150] The next day, the Yankees granted him his unconditional release.[153]\n\nRumors swirled regarding Rodriguez's future in baseball; the Miami Marlins were interested in signing him to play first base until his spokesman Ron Berkowitz emailed the media on August 15 and said on behalf of Rodriguez, \"I want to put all this talk to rest about Alex playing for any team this season. It's not happening. Like he said Friday night, he is happy and he is going to take some time to relax and hang with his family and friends.\"[154] Rodriguez ended the season playing 65 games with a .200 batting average, 9 home runs and 31 RBIs.\n\nIn January 2017, Rodriguez's spokesman said that he would not play for any other team in the coming year, and would remain a \"special advisor\" to Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner.[155]\n\nCriticism\n\nDue to the unsuccessful nature of the Yankees postseasons from 2004 to 2007, along with Rodriguez's sub-.200 batting average in the postseasons of 2005 and 2006,[25] Rodriguez drew criticism in the New York area, both from writers, such as the New York Post's Joel Sherman, and players, such as then-teammate, Jason Giambi.[156][157] Prior to 2009, Rodriguez had received the nickname \"The Cooler\" among some players because of the perceived tendency for teams to turn cold when he joins them and hot when he leaves.[158][159][160][161] According to Yankee manager Joe Torre's 2009 book, The Yankee Years, Rodriguez earned the nickname \"A-Fraud\" from teammates and particularly from clubhouse attendants who were said to resent his demands.[162] \"It was [said] in front of him\", Torre later said of the nickname. \"A lot of that stuff that went on in the clubhouse was more tongue-in-cheek, fun type stuff\", he explained.[163]\n\nMuch of the criticism regarding Rodriguez focuses on his alleged inability to produce hits in clutch situations.[164][165] In 2008, Rodriguez hit only .264 with runners in scoring position and two outs. In 95 plate appearances, he walked 20 times and was hit by three pitches, and he had only 19 hits. Of the 41 times Rodriguez struck out with two outs, 20 came with runners in scoring position.[87]\n\nBecause of the Yankees' successful history, he was compared unfavorably to other Yankees greats who have performed exceptionally well in the postseason, such as Reggie Jackson.[166][167][168][169][170][171] However, after his performance in the 2009 postseason, Rodriguez started receiving many positive comparisons to Reggie Jackson, even being selected as \"Mr. October\" by Jackson and USA Today.[172]\n\nRodriguez answered many of the criticisms of his postseason performance by performing exceptionally well in the 2009 postseason, where he posted a .365 batting average and hit six home-runs in 52 at-bats during the Yankees' 15 post-season games.[173]\n\nUse of performance-enhancing drugs\n\nIn July 2007, former outfielder and steroid-user Jose Canseco said that he was planning to publish another book about Major League Baseball, to follow his 2005 bestseller Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits & How Baseball Got Big. Canseco said his new book would have \"other stuff\" on Rodriguez, and called him a hypocrite.[174] At the time, Rodriguez denied accusations of steroid use.[175] In a 2007 interview with Katie Couric, Rodriguez flatly denied ever having used performance-enhancing drugs.[176]\n\nIn February 2009, Selena Roberts and David Epstein of Sports Illustrated reported that Rodriguez had tested positive for two anabolic steroids, testosterone and Primobolan, during his 2003 season playing for the Texas Rangers, the same season in which he captured his first American League Most Valuable Player award, broke 300 career home runs (hitting 47 that year),[177] and earned one of his ten Silver Slugger Awards. The information had been part of a government-sealed report detailing 104 major league players (out of 1200 players tested)[89] who tested positive for performance enhancers during a 2003 drug survey. Approved by the players themselves with the promise of anonymity,[89] the survey was conducted by Major League Baseball to see whether a mandatory drug testing program might be necessary. At the time, as the result of a collectively bargained union agreement,[89] there was no penalty or punishment for a positive test.[88][178] Because more than 5% of the samples taken from players in 2003 came back positive, mandatory testing of major league baseball players began in 2004, with penalties for violations.[90]\n\nThe 2003 test results were supposed to remain anonymous and the samples destroyed. However, a coded master list of 104 players was seized during the BALCO investigation, turning up in a 2004 federal raid on Comprehensive Drug Testing's facility in Long Beach, California. A month later, the physical samples were seized by federal agents raiding Quest Diagnostics in Las Vegas, Nevada.[90] The list of the 104 positive-testing players was released to the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA) in 2004.[4] The players' union later said that the 104 positive samples were in the process of being destroyed when they were subpoenaed by federal authorities in November 2003, making continued destruction \"improper.\"[179]\n\nAlthough testosterone is available by prescription for some uses, Primobolan has no approved prescription use.[88] Also known as methenolone or metenolone enanthate, it is the same steroid that Barry Bonds is alleged to have tested positive for in 2000 and 2001.[90] A fairly weak steroid on its own, it is generally used in conjunction with other steroids.[180] The drug is generally preferred in injected rather than oral form due to its cost.[180] An official statement by Major League Baseball made shortly after Rodriguez's test results became public expressed \"grave concern\" without naming Rodriguez, noting that \"because the survey testing that took place in 2003 was intended to be non-disciplinary and anonymous, we can not make any comment on the accuracy of this report as it pertains to the player named.\"[181]\n\nIn an interview with ESPN after the report came out, citing \"an enormous amount of pressure to perform\", Rodriguez admitted to using banned substances from 2001 to 2003.[4] \"All my years in New York have been clean\", he added, saying he has not used banned substances since last taking them following a spring training injury in 2003 while playing for the Rangers.[4][5] \"Back then, [baseball] was a different culture\", Rodriguez said. \"It was very loose. I was young, I was stupid, I was na\u00efve. And I wanted to prove to everyone that I was worth being one of the greatest players of all time. I did take a banned substance. And for that, I am very sorry and deeply regretful.\"[4][5] Rodriguez said he could not be sure of the name(s) of the substance(s) he had used.[4][5]\n\nRodriguez said he was never told that he was among the 104 players who tested positive, only that a tip came in August 2004 from Gene Orza of the MLBPA that he \"may or may not have\" failed his 2003 test.[4] Orza is accused by three (unnamed) MLB players of tipping Rodriguez to an upcoming drug test in September 2004. Orza and the MLBPA have denied the allegations.[182]\n\nRodriguez absolved the players' union of any blame for leaking his positive test results, saying he alone was responsible for his mistakes.[4] Friend and former teammate Doug Glanville, while noting the outrage over Rodriguez's years of steroid use, berated Rodriguez's critics for their \"lack of outrage about how a confidential and anonymous test could be made public.\"[89] No Major League player, Glanville wrote, would have participated in the 2003 survey if he had thought the results had even a chance of becoming public. \"It has everything to do with privacy. Being A-Rod should not change that fact.\"[89]\n\nMLB Commissioner Bud Selig briefly considered whether or not to punish Rodriguez for his admitted steroid use, citing the illegality of the situation, among other things. However, at the time of the testing there were no punishments for this sort of activity.[183] Additionally, his admission to three years of steroid use could be damaging to his image and legacy.[5]\n\nLater in the month, Rodriguez called a press conference in Tampa, Florida, and in the presence of many supportive Yankee teammates, answered reporters' questions about his 2001\u20132003 steroid use.[176][184] Rodriguez said he and a cousin (whom he refused to name) bought an unidentified drug over-the-counter in the Dominican Republic, where it is \"known on the streets as boli or bollee.\"[176][185] At Rodriguez's instruction, the cousin transported the drug into the United States.[186] For six months of the year, Rodriguez injected himself twice monthly with \"boli\" (a drug name unfamiliar to experts and perhaps a slang term for Primobolan or Dianabol, although the latter steroid is taken orally).[176] Rodriguez said he did not know whether he was using the drug properly or whether it was safe.[176] Although he \"certainly felt more energy\", Rodriguez said it would be \"hard to say\" whether it gave him a competitive edge.[184]\n\nRodriguez said he would become a spokesperson for the Taylor Hooton foundation, which educates young people about the dangers of steroid use.[176][184] He has since spoken at schools about the dangers of steroids.[187]\n\nOn February 28, 2010, The New York Times reported that Rodriguez received treatment from Canadian sports doctor Anthony Galea in March 2009.[188] In 2011, Galea reached a plea agreement for bringing unapproved and mislabled drugs into the United States, including human growth hormone (HGH) and Actovegin. Galea confirmed to the Associated Press that he treated Rodriguez but said he only prescribed anti-inflammatories.[189]\n\nBiogenesis baseball scandal\n\nRodriguez reportedly received HGH from Biogenesis of America, an anti-aging clinic in Coral Gables, Florida run by Bosch.[190] For much of the summer, it had been expected that Rodriguez would be suspended for his role in the scandal. The first definitive confirmation came on August 3, when MLB rebuffed the players' union's last-minute offer to negotiate. Instead, it gave Rodriguez until the afternoon of August 4 to reach an agreement regarding a suspension or greater punishment for his role in the Biogenesis affair.[191]\n\nOn August 5, 2013, MLB suspended Rodriguez from August 8 through the end of the 2014 season for violating the league's PED policy. He would originally miss a total of 211 regular-season games plus any postseason games. He was one of 13 players suspended for their roles in the scandal.[192] In its official statement, MLB said that the suspension was based on Rodriguez's \"use and possession of numerous forms of prohibited performance-enhancing substances, including Testosterone and human Growth Hormone, over the course of multiple years\" and \"for attempting to cover-up his violations of the Program by engaging in a course of conduct intended to obstruct and frustrate the Office of the Commissioner's investigation.\"[193] Although the standard punishment for a first offense under MLB's drug policy is 50 games, MLB had the option of suspending Rodriguez for longer than that under the collective bargaining agreement if it determined his actions constituted conduct detrimental to baseball.[194]\n\nAlmost immediately after the suspension was announced, Rodriguez announced that he would appeal. He was the only player to do so; the others accepted season-ending 50-game suspensions without appeal.[195] Although MLB Commissioner Bud Selig had the option of using his best-interests-of-baseball powers to remove Rodriguez from the field immediately, he chose to suspend Rodriguez under the drug agreement and not the CBA, allowing Rodriguez to continue playing while the appeal was underway. The proposed suspension would include a global lock clause, which would also prevent him from playing in other known leagues, such as Nippon Professional Baseball and the Korea Baseball Championship for example, as the leagues in those nations honor any suspensions imposed by MLB.[122] Rodriguez hired New York criminal defense lawyer Joe Tacopina.[196]\n\nA lengthy arbitration process followed, but the suspension was upheld on January 11, 2014. However, since Rodriguez was allowed to play during the appeal process, this effectively reduced the suspension to 162 games \u2013 the entirety of the 2014 regular-season schedule. Because Rodriguez was on the suspended list retroactive through August 31, the suspension would have included the postseason if the Yankees qualified (but did not qualify that year). He subsequently issued a statement saying he would be challenging the decision in federal court.[10] On February 7, 2014 Rodriguez announced that he was dropping his lawsuit and accepting his suspension for the 2014 season.[197] In March 2014, multiple sources reported that Rodriguez was refusing to pay the balance of his legal fees for his defense, which amounted to over $3 million.[198][199] In July 2014, Rodriguez was in fact sued by his lawyers for $380,000 in unpaid legal fees.[200][201]\n\nIn November 2014, it was revealed that back in January Rodriguez had admitted to the Drug Enforcement Administration that he had used performance-enhancing drugs.[202] This was contrary to his sentiments of 18 days earlier, when he had vehemently denied the allegations and also denied having used human growth hormones.\n\nPersonal life\n\nRodriguez grew up with two half-siblings, Joe and Suzy, who were born in the Dominican Republic and are children from his mother's first marriage.[203] Rodriguez also has a half-brother, Victor M. Rodriguez, who was born to Alex's father Victor Sr. and his then-wife Pouppe Martinez in 1960.[203] The couple divorced a year later, and Victor Jr. was raised by his mother.[203] Victor Jr., who is an officer in the United States Air Force, fell out of touch with Alex for a period of 23 years, until they met at a Texas Rangers game in 2003.[203] His nephew, Joe Dunand, is a professional baseball player.[204]\n\nIn 2002, he married Cynthia Scurtis, a psychology graduate[206] he had met at a gym in Miami, Florida.[207] The couple's first child, Natasha Alexander, was born on November 18, 2004. On April 21, 2008, Cynthia gave birth to their second child, Ella Alexander,[208] in Miami, Florida.\n\nCynthia Rodriguez filed for divorce on July 7, 2008, citing \"emotional abandonment\" of her and their children, as well as \"extra marital [sic] affairs and other marital misconduct\" by her husband.[209][210] Rodriguez responded in court documents that the marriage was \"irretrievably broken\" but requested that allegations of his \"extramarital affairs\" be stricken from court records.[211][212] The couple reached a settlement that September.[211] In July, Madonna responded to rumors of an affair with Rodriguez by issuing a statement saying, \"I am not romantically involved in any way with Alex Rodriguez\" and has \"nothing to do with the state of his marriage\".[213]\n\nAs of February 2017, he has been dating Jennifer Lopez.[214]\n\nRodriguez used to own a Mercedes-Benz dealership in League City, Texas,[215] and in his free time, Rodriguez buys and collects art.[216] He is an investor for eSports team NRG Esports.[217]\n\nAs previously mentioned, Rodriguez and Jeter's friendship had cooled in recent years. However as of 2011 , they have grown close again.[218]\n\nAs of 2011 , Rodriguez is represented by sports agent Dan Lozano.[219]\n\nCharity\n\nRodriguez takes batting practice in 2009\n\nIn 2003, Rodriguez gave $3.9 million to the University of Miami to renovate its baseball stadium.[220] The new facility was renamed \"Alex Rodriguez Park at Mark Light Field\".[220] Rodriguez remains an ardent University of Miami fan.[221] Despite not having attended the school, he received the University of Miami's Edward T. Foote II Alumnus of Distinction Award in 2007 as an honorary alumnus.[222] Rodriguez had previously been named an \"honorary alumnus\" of the university in 2004. He is a member of the University of Miami's Board of Trustees.[223]\n\nMarketing\n\nRodriguez was featured in a Pepsi Cola commercial as a truck driver in a fleet of delivery trucks simulating players in a baseball game. At the end of the commercial when he drives his vehicle to make a catch, he is told by his approving partner in the truck that he has a future in the beverage delivery business.[224]\n\nRodriguez is featured in a commercial for Guitar Hero World Tour, where he plays the guitar along with athletes Tony Hawk on drums, Kobe Bryant on vocals, and Michael Phelps on guitar. The commercial is a spoof of the scene from Risky Business where Tom Cruise is dancing to \"Old Time Rock and Roll\".[225]\n\nAwards and honors\n\nMajor league, minor league and high school awards and exhibition team selections\n\nAchievements\n\nNotes: Per Baseball-Reference.com.\n\nRecords\n\nMajor League Records Record Total Season Most home runs by a player of Hispanic descent 696 since 1994 Most home runs by a New York-born player 696 since 1994 Most career grand slams 25 since 1994 Most runs in a season (SS) 141 1996 Most extra base hits in a season (SS) 91 1996 Highest slugging percentage in a season (SS) .631 1996 Most total bases in a season (SS) 393 2001 Most home runs in a season (SS) 57 2002 Most home runs in the month of April (tied) 14 2007 Fewest games to hit 12 home runs to start a season (tied) 15 2007 Fewest games to hit 13 and 14 home runs to start a season 18 2007 Youngest ever to hit 500 home runs 32y, 8d 2007 Most home runs by a third baseman (season) 52\u2020 2007 Most stolen bases in a 50-home run season 24* 2007\n\n\u2020: Rodriguez hit 2 home runs as a DH in the 2007 season. *: Tied with Willie Mays\n\nAmerican League Records Record Total Season(s) Most home runs in consecutive seasons (RH) 109 2001\u20132002 Most home runs in the month of April 14 2007 Fewest games to hit 10 home runs to start a season 14 2007 Fewest games to hit 12 home runs to start a season 15 2007\n\nNew York Yankees Records Record Total Season(s) Most home runs in a season at home (RH) 26 2005, 2007 Most home runs in a season (RH) 54 2007 Most RBIs in a postseason 18 2009 Most home runs in a postseason 6\u2020 2009\n\n\u2020: Tied with Bernie Williams.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences"}

{"label": true, "txt": "Swedish four-piece take to Instagram to announce two releases that will form part of an \u2018avatar tour project\u2019\n\nAbba have announced that they have written and recorded their first new songs since they split in 1983.\n\nThe Swedish four-piece, who had nine No 1 hits in the UK between 1974 and 1980, and who have sold hundreds of millions of records worldwide, announced on Instagram that they had recorded two new songs for a project in which avatars of the band will perform.\n\nAbba's return will be either genius or disaster \u2013 but nothing in between | Alexis Petridis Read more\n\nThe band said in a statement: \u201cThe decision to go ahead with the exciting Abba avatar tour project had an unexpected consequence. We all felt that, after some 35 years, it could be fun to join forces again and go into the recording studio. So we did. And it was like time had stood still and we had only been away on a short holiday. An extremely joyful experience!\u201d\n\nOne of the two new songs that resulted, called I Still Have Faith in You, will feature in a TV special to air in December.\n\nThe statement concluded: \u201cWe may have come of age, but the song is new. And it feels good.\u201d\n\nAbba\u2019s Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus revealed details of the band\u2019s forthcoming project in Brussels earlier this week. The centrepiece is the two-hour TV show co-produced by NBC and the BBC, which will see the band perform as computer-generated avatars. Ulvaeus said the band had been digitally scanned and \u201cde-aged\u201d to look like they did in 1979, when they performed their third and final tour.\n\nThe avatars are then set to tour the world from next year.\n\nAbba formed in Stockholm in 1972. They comprised two couples: Ulvaeus and Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog; and Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad, all of whom had enjoyed musical careers in Sweden. The group burst on to the international stage after winning the Eurovision song contest in Brighton in 1974 with their song Waterloo.\n\nFrom the mid-70s until they split, Abba built up a formidable arsenal of global hits including Knowing Me, Knowing You, Take a Chance on Me, Dancing Queen and The Name of the Game \u2013 all of which reached No 1 in the UK.\n\nF\u00e4ltskog and Lyngstad were the lead singers; Andersson and Ulvaeus composed the songs. Never less than impeccably produced and performed, Abba\u2019s records were critically disdained at the time, but their popularity has endured. Their 1992 compilation Abba Gold has sold 30m copies \u2013 more than 5m of those in the Britain \u2013 and spent 833 weeks in the UK album charts.\n\nTheir jukebox musical Mamma Mia! debuted in the West End in 1999 and is still running both in London and worldwide; its website claims that it has been seen by 60 million people in 440 cities.\n\nThe stage show was adapted into a film in 2008, which grossed $615m (\u00a3447m) worldwide. A sequel, Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again, will be released in June. The actor Lily James \u2013 who is set to appear alongside the cast of the first film including Meryl Streep, Amanda Seyfried and Colin Firth \u2013 told the BBC last week: \u201cThere\u2019s lot of songs in there, lots of new ones. Lots of ones, actually, that weren\u2019t in my repertoire of Abba and I think they\u2019re going to be huge hits again, and reawaken the love of Abba.\u201d\n\nAbba\u2019s split in 1983 followed the divorces of both couples. Ulvaeus and Andersson went on to write two musicals, including Chess \u2013 a revival by the English National Opera opens on Friday in London \u2013 before largely devoting themselves to Abba\u2019s legacy. F\u00e4ltskog and Lyngstad have kept much lower profiles, though F\u00e4ltskog \u2013 long claimed to be a recluse \u2013 returned to pop music with an album, A, which was released in 2013.\n\nThe group have long held out against lucrative offers to reform \u2013 they were reported to have been offered $1bn to play a concert in 2000. In 2014, Ulvaeus told Billboard: \u201cyou will never see us on stage again \u2026 we don\u2019t need the money, for one thing.\u201d\n\nPeter Robinson, editor of Popjustice, described the announcement as \u201cthe biggest pop news of the 21st century. Most fans grudgingly admired Abba\u2019s refusal to record new music, but I think we all sometimes daydreamed about the band possibly, maybe, one day having a rethink at the right time, on the right terms and for the right reasons, which seems to be what\u2019s happened here.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s a pop miracle.\u201d"}

{"label": true, "txt": "One TV family is about to grow by one! America\u2019s Next Top Model cycle 3 winner and current Real Housewives of Atlanta star, Eva Marcille, is pregnant with her second child, a baby boy, with her boyfriend, Michael Sterling, Us Weekly reported on Tuesday. According to the publication, Marcille shares her first child \u2014 3-year-old daughter, Marley Rae \u2014 with her ex-boyfriend Kevin McCall.\n\nAlong with an Instagram post from Nov. 21, Marcille revealed that she was expecting her second child in an exclusive interview with People, saying that after her daughter had told her she wanted it to be a boy. And as it turns out, the little girl's wish came true! \u201cI felt like she willed it in her favor,\u201d Marcille said of her daughter\u2019s prediction, adding that she was \u201cbeyond elated to be having a boy.\u201d\n\nShe also spoke about the surprise she felt in discovering she was pregnant, as she originally just felt a little off. \u201cMy body felt super weird,\u201d she told People. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what was going on. I went to the doctor and because of my symptoms, he decided to do an ultrasound to see if I had any cysts or tumors or fibroids or things of that nature.\u201d\n\nAnd while the ultrasound obviously wasn\u2019t what she expected, it was definitely some happy news. Because even though getting pregnant during her partner's mayoral campaign might have felt a little overwhelming at the time, Marcille is so ready to share her exciting news with the world now. The 33-year-old is now five months along and due in spring 2018.\n\n\"I was shocked and terrified all at the same time,\u201d she told People. \u201cIt was not planned \u2014 it was very unexpected, and [Michael] was in the middle of this mayoral campaign where being pregnant was not a part of the agenda.\" However, Marcille's husband, Sterling, ended up dropping out of the mayoral race in October (and the Nov. 7 election ended up bringing a victory for two women, who will face a runoff election in December). Clearly, the couple has had a busy few months, and now that things have settled down, they can start to really enjoy this exciting new time together.\n\nAnd as babies tend to do, the news of Marcille's pregnancy sent 35-year-old Sterling, who's a lawyer, into somewhat of a shock. \"When I initially told him, he was like, \u2018Oh, okay,\u2019 and I could tell he was surprised and didn\u2019t want to overreact or react in a way that he would regret or that would scare me,\" she explained to People.\n\nHowever, Sterling took some time to absorb the news, and was soon totally on board. \"We talked about it again, and he was excited,\" Marcille said to People. \"Which was a huge relief to me \u2014 excitement is what we want.\" And based on her life so far, excitement is something Marcille has become accustomed to. She was the third winner of America's Next Top Model back in 2004 and has since starred in a variety of movies and television shows, including The Young and the Restless and Sister Code. Currently, Marcille is set to debut on The Real Housewives of Atlanta alongside series legend NeNe Leakes.\n\nAnd while the official news of Marcille's pregnancy is still pretty new to the world, the family actually already has a name picked out for the little fellow, according to People. Technically, he will be Michael Todd Sterling Jr., but Marcille's daughter has already given him a nickname. \"Mikey \u2014 that\u2019s what Marley calls him,\" she said.\n\nClearly, the model, mother, and reality star is happy to finally share her good news, and she should be!\n\nCheck out Romper's new video series, Romper's Doula Diaries:\n\nWatch full episodes of Romper's Doula Diaries on Facebook Watch."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Nearly 27 years after brutally slaying their parents in August 1989, Lyle and Erik Menendez are back in the public eye. The two-hour Thursday, January 5, ABC special, entitled Truth And Lies: The Menendez Brothers, revisited the double homicide and featured an interview with Lyle as he serves his two life sentences in Mule Creek State Prison in Ione, California.\n\nWatch Us Weekly Video's recap above, and read on for seven revelations from the chilling program.\n\nLyle and Erik Robbed Houses in Calabasas\n\nThe murders of Kitty and Jose Menendez were not Lyle and Erik\u2019s first brush with crime. When the affluent Menendez family moved to Los Angeles in 1987, they initially settled in Calabasas. Karen Ferrell, a close friend of the late Kitty, pointed out houses in the neighborhood, even saying, \u201cBruce Jenner \u2014 when he was Bruce Jenner \u2014 had a house here.\u201d Karen then continued, saying of the brothers, \u201cThey were bored.\u2026 Robbing houses was a challenge.\u2026 They didn\u2019t think they\u2019d be caught.\u201d\n\nTheir father, the late Jose, a wealthy Hollywood producer at the time, attempted to smooth things over by visiting each house and writing the victims a check in the amount equal to the value of what was stolen. Their neighbor Alicia Hercz told the camera, \u201cThe main message was, 'How stupid of you to get caught.'\" According to Craig Cignarelli, a former friend of Erik's, after getting caught stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of jewelry and other items, \u201cThey both got probation\u2026 moved down to Beverly Hills.\u201d\n\nErik\u2019s Modeling Photographer Read His Screenplay About Murdering His Parents\n\nCignarelli admitted to the camera about Erik, \u201cWe wrote a screenplay. We wrote several screenplays.\u201d Photographer Philip Kearney, known for taking the infamous shirtless modeling photos of Erik, was a recipient of the script, saying it was \u201cabout the boy who kills his parents to collect the insurance.\u201d Cignarelli clarified the plot point, saying, \u201cWe needed the characters to get money somehow \u2026\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cAs time went by, Erik took that screenplay and reworded the first four or five pages to exactly what happened in the crime.\u201d When Kearney turned on the news the morning after the murder, he recalled feeling a \u201cchilling realization.\u201d Kearney recalled the famous underwear photoshoot with Erik, saying, \u201cThe last photo shoot was a little bit different.\u2026 He was a quieter.\u2026 A little more humble.\u2026 Those pictures to me look a little more haunting.\u201d\n\nKitty Admitted in Front of Erik That She Was Taking Him Out of Her Will\n\nKitty's friend Karen Ferrell then recalled a moment between Kitty and Erik. Kitty was at the family computer updating her will and speaking openly to Karen about it. Karen recalled mentioning to Kitty that Erik was listening in the other room: \"She said, 'I don\u2019t care. They know I\u2019m not gonna give them any money.'\" (The family estate was worth 14 million at the time of her murder.) Kitty\u2019s brother Brian Anderson revealed to the camera that Kitty was worried about her children, saying, \u201cShe was really concerned about the irresponsibility.\u2026 Lyle was stressing her a lot.\u201d\n\nLyle and Erik Shot Their Parents to Death, Then Went Shopping for Rolexes Weeks Later\n\nLyle and Erik\u2019s bizarre post-murder behavior was one of the reasons they were eventually convicted of murder in the first degree. Beverly Hills Detective Leslie Zoeller recalled of the brutal murder scene on August 20, 1989, \u201cKitty was wearing white, she was covered in blood.\u2026 There was brain matter on the ceiling, on the windows. It was really horrendous.\u201d In a clip from a 1996 interview with Barbara Walters, Erik recalled, \u201cWe didn\u2019t have an alibi \u2014 we just said we were at the movies.\u201d\n\nFive weeks after the murder, Erik and Lyle received $400,000 in life insurance money and decided to go on a spending spree. ABC journalist Terry Moran recalled, \u201cThey were having a grand ol\u2019 time spending the money of a dead man.\u201d They bought Rolexes, a Porsche and even took the time to invest some of the money in a friend\u2019s business before their eventual arrest.\n\nErik and Lyle\u2019s Abuse Claims\n\nThe crux of Lyle and Erik\u2019s 1993 trial hinged on testimony that the two of them were allegedly abused by their parents. Prosecutor Pam Bozanich recalled about Erik\u2019s lawyer, Leslie Abramson, \u201cEveryone told me, \u2018Watch out for her. She will lie, cheat and steal.\u201d Pam continued, \u201cThe whole 'abuse excuse' is a lie.\u201d\n\nHowever, journalist Moran backed Erik and Lyle\u2019s abuse claims. Moran explained of their gruesome abuse testimony, \u201cThere was a level of detail.\u2026 There are things that people remember from real life that you almost wouldn\u2019t kind of make up.\u201d He recalled noticing Erik\u2019s reaction to Lyle\u2019s testimony of his father molesting him and said, \u201cI saw this vein start popping out of his forehead\u2026 that emotion. That\u2019s what a victim looks like.\u201d\n\nMoran also noted that several family members testified to the abuse. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain that away,\u201d said Moran. He later told the camera, \"If the Menendez brothers were the Menedez sisters, they would be free today. We don\u2019t wanna think that boys get raped by their fathers.\"\n\nKitty\u2019s brother, on the other hand, did not believe the abuse claims at all: \"There was certainly no indication at any time that there was ever any abuse.\u2026 I mean it just didn\u2019t happen.\u2026 I think the motive was strictly money.\" He later said, \"The idea that Erik and Lyle were abused by my sister Kitty was gratuitous.\"\n\nErik and Lyle Both Got Married While Serving Life Sentences\n\nEventually, the Menendez case resulted in a mistrial, causing the whole process to start all over again. The second trial went much more quickly, and a verdict came in July 1996, which followed the October 1995 decision in the similarly captivating O.J. Simpson case. Terry Moran remembered, \u201cWhen O.J. Simpson was acquitted \u2026 it brought tremendous law-and-order pressure on jurors across the spectrum.\u201d\n\nThey were quickly sentenced to murder in the first degree and are both serving consecutive life sentences in separate prisons. Lyle and Erik, now 48 and 45 years old respectively, both tied the knot while behind bars. Erik is married to Tammi Menendez, who \u2014 in a 2002 interview with Barbara Walters \u2014 revealed, \u201cI fell in love with him unexpectedly.\u2026 And now I\u2019m very happy.\u201d\n\nLyle has been married twice and spoke out about his current relationship with wife Rebecca Sneed, saying, \u201cPhysical comfort is much less important than your connection with the people around you,\u2026 We\u2019ve been married 15 years.\u201d Lyle then called it a \u201chealthy marriage.\u201d\n\nLyle: \"It Could Have So Easily Not Have Happened\"\n\nThe most fascinating part of the documentary may have been when Lyle spoke publicly about his life behind bars. Reflecting on the past, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re not living in the reality of what has occurred.\u2026 You\u2019re living like a ghost among people that are alive. You\u2019re just adrift.\u201d He spoke about his life now, saying he has a \u201chigh level of stress.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cMy own childhood prepared me surprisingly well for the chaos of prison life.\u2026 You feel that loss of freedom deeply.\u201d About murdering both of his parents, he stated, \u201cIt\u2019s shocking to think about that that happened.\u2026 It\u2019s still jarring. Like, it seems so far removed from who I am and who I was \u2026\u201d He went on to call his life \"a failed, destructive ending.\u2026 It could have so easily not have happened.\u201d\n\nThe documentary ended after revealing that Lyle and Erik haven\u2019t seen each other since 1996.\n\nTell Us: What did you think of Lyle's comments?\n\nTruth and Lies: The Menendez Brothers airs on ABC Thursday, January 5, at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?

{"label": true, "txt": "\u201cAmerican Horror Story: Cult brings a lot of things to mind. We learned there were gonna be clowns and phobias addressed. The three main phobias are coulrophobia, [fear of clowns], hemophobia [fear of blood], and trypophobia, which is this fear of irregularly shaped holes that you would find in coral, stuff like that. We were given the first two or three scripts, and in one of them, you learn that the neighbors keep bees. We immediately knew that was a symbol for a cult. Bees have a hive mentality. A cult has a hive mentality. There\u2019s a leader. There\u2019s the queen. There\u2019s the woman who has the trypophobia texture to her skin. She has bee eyes, and she has these manipulative hands coming up over her head, and that represents the cult leader and manipulation and control of the people in his cult. There\u2019s the image of the woman wearing that mask with the holes in it. The holes are all hexagons, so that again pulls from the hive, but it also pulls from trypophobia and bees, the anonymity of the hive mind. You\u2019re giving up your individuality.\u201d"}

{"label": true, "txt": "The 100 star Lindsey Morgan speaks to Hypable about Raven\u2019s arc in the beginning of The 100 season 5 \u2014 specifically staying on the Eligius ship, and reuniting with Clarke.\n\nRaven Reyes has had a rough six years in space.\n\nAlthough The 100 has positioned SpaceKru (Bellamy, Raven, Monty, Harper, Emori, Murphy and Echo) as the most well-functioning faction of Praimfaya survivors, Lindsey Morgan\u2019s Raven was not able to lay down her burdens in the same way that most of her friends have done.\n\nRelated: Will Raven Reyes be happy in The 100 season 5? Lindsey Morgan teases SpaceKru\u2019s post-Praimfaya journey\n\nBecause, as Morgan explains in an exclusive interview with Hypable, Raven feels like she is responsible for stranding them in space, and she had practically made it her life mission to get them back to the ground.\n\nFrom Raven\u2019s perspective, \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t be in space and threatened this way if it wasn\u2019t for Raven\u2019s indecision about the bunker,\u201d says Morgan.\n\n\u201cRaven screwed up the plan, and made them come get her, and ruined everyone\u2019s chance of safety. So them being in space is completely Raven\u2019s fault, and leaving Clarke, and ultimately killing Clarke is completely Raven\u2019s fault, and she knows that.\u201d\n\nSo when the opportunity presented itself in The 100 5\u00d703 \u201cSleeping Giants,\u201d she did not hesitate to sacrifice herself for her friends.\n\nShe lied to Bellamy, telling him there was an escape pod, knowing that this false assurance would give him peace of mind to leave Raven behind and go find his sister.\n\n\u201cRaven is trying to hide her desperation to Bellamy because she doesn\u2019t want him to get suspicious about it,\u201d says Morgan. \u201cBecause if he knew the truth, he wouldn\u2019t let her go. But she has to sacrifice herself to get them home safe, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t be able to live with herself.\u201d\n\nAlthough it was a tough scene to watch and film, Morgan counts \u201cSleeping Giants\u201d among her favorite episodes for Raven.\n\n\u201cI love that she got to make that decision. In a weird way, it gave her peace,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was such an amazing way for Raven to pay homage to Clarke. And show gratitude to her friends.\u201d\n\nOf course we know that this is not the end of Raven\u2019s story. How she and Murphy eventually get to the ground, and what happens when they do, are still mysteries.\n\nBut despite not yet being on the ground, Raven and Murphy got to be the second and third person to reunite with Clarke, over the radio, in an extremely emotional scene in 5\u00d704 \u201cPandora\u2019s Box.\u201d\n\nMorgan describes this scene as \u201cvery special, very moving, and just such a shock\u201d for Raven.\n\n\u201cI remember filming that scene, and I just\u2026 I was stunned,\u201d Morgan remembers. \u201cIt was such an interesting emotion to play, because it was almost like hearing an angel speak, you know? Not to be dramatic! But that\u2019s what it felt like.\u201d\n\nMorgan describes Raven finding out Clarke is alive as \u201ca literal miracle. I don\u2019t think Raven has ever gotten that lucky before.\u201d\n\nClarke and Raven\u2019s relationship has always been a cornerstone of The 100, although sadly, the pair don\u2019t often get to cross storylines.\n\nRegardless, \u201cClarke means so much to Raven,\u201d Morgan says. \u201cClarke and Raven are connected in ways that others aren\u2019t. They have such a special and complex relationship, after everything they\u2019ve been through. There\u2019s so much respect and love at the core of it.\u201d\n\nBecause of their connection, and because of Raven\u2019s guilt surrounding Clarke\u2019s death, Morgan says that \u201cit was hard for Raven to imagine her life without [Clarke]. She was just so important to her.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo have her be gone, and to reconcile with that, and knowing it was her fault\u2026 and then to find out she was alive? It really was a miracle.\u201d\n\nWe will have to wait and see what happens when/if Raven and Clarke reunite on the ground. For now, it is great to see Raven let go of some of her guilt (even as new trouble is brewing), and to be reminded of how much these two women still mean to each other, after all this time.\n\nThis was the second part of our big The 100 season 5 interview with Lindsey Morgan. You can read the first, much longer part of the interview right here.\n\n\u2018The 100\u2019 season 5 airs Tuesdays at 9/8c on The CW"}

{"label": true, "txt": "Supergirl this week is a beautiful respite from the heaviness of previous episodes this season as Kara takes Alex back home to Midvale for a few days, to get away from the memories of Maggie in National City and begin to heal from her break-up. And without acknowledging it, perhaps Kara is there to do some healing from Mon-El, too. The episode is mostly a flashback to Young Kara and Young Alex during the time when they really and truly became sisters. Welcome to Season 3, Episode 6, \u201cMidvale.\u201d\n\n**THIS IS A RECAP \u2013 SPOILERS ARE PART OF THE TERRITORY.**\n\nS3, EP. 6 \u2013 THE RECAP\n\nThe episode opens with Kara and Alex driving to Eliza\u2019s. \u201cWelcome home,\u201d Kara announces, as they drive into Midvale. Alex looks miserable. When they arrive at their childhood home, Eliza greets them with hugs, but Alex sulks and goes into the house without saying a word.\n\nLater, Kara is out on the porch drinking coffee when Eliza comes to join her. Kara says that she brought Alex here hoping to help her feel better, and Eliza agrees it might be good for her, saying that Alex needs to \u201clean into\u201d her pain, rather than pretend it doesn\u2019t exist. Then Eliza turns to Kara and her miserable year that has most recently taken Mon-El away from her. Eliza thinks that Kara constantly punishes herself for daring to have feelings and be weak sometimes, but Kara says that she\u2019s \u201caccepting the fact that I\u2019m human,\u201d and that she has to \u201cwalk away from certain\u2026vulnerabilities,\u201d meaning romantic relationships, among other things. Eliza urges Kara to remember to let herself heal, too. Kara insists she\u2019s fine.\n\nUpstairs, Alex is drinking something much stronger than coffee in their childhood bedroom when Kara joins her. Kara tries to get her to talk about her feelings, and Alex calls Kara on her hypocrisy, saying that she\u2019s asking Alex to talk now when she herself spent six months being closed off whenever Alex tried to help her. This leads to a fight, and the sisters go to bed angry.\n\nFLASHBACK TO \u201cTEN YEARS AGO.\u201d Young Alex (Olivia Nikkanen) and Young Kara wake up for school and race to the bedroom door. Kara lets Alex go out the door first, but then uses her super-speed to get to the bathroom first. Alex pounds on the door as Eliza calls them down to breakfast. In their high school years, Kara and Alex were not close. As they sit down to breakfast with Eliza, Kara resents that she has to go to school, while Alex resents Kara\u2019s existence.\n\nAt school, Young Alex and Young Kara sit in history class, and Young Kara is bored and not paying attention. Their teacher, Mr. Bernard, calls on Kara to ask her who the General of the Continental Army was. \u201cIsaiah Washington?\u201d she guesses. Alex corrects her with the right answer: George Washington. Alex then goes on to give Mr. Bernard extra information, totally showing off to rub Kara\u2019s nose in it. Later, in gym class, Kara excels and shows off on rope climbing for Alex\u2019s benefit.\n\nLater, at lunch, Kara overhears two students talking about Superman in the lunch line and starts to geek out about him. The kids think that she and Superman are weirdos, Superman for wearing his underwear outside of his tights. The kids start belittling Kara, but Alex shows up and tells them to leave her alone. But when Kara thanks her, Alex coldly tells her she only did it because Kara was holding up the line.\n\nThe girls sit at separate tables during lunch. Alex sits with a table full of friends. Kara sits alone. A boy named Kenny walks in, and it\u2019s clear he\u2019s not one of the popular kids. A football player bullies him, and it\u2019s all Kara can do not to use her powers to rain holy hell on him. Instead, she calms herself and calls Kenny over to sit with her after Alex rudely brushes him off. However, it becomes clear that he prefers talking to Kara. He asks her to go out with him that night, and she agrees.\n\nKara meets him to go stargazing, and he allows her to look through his telescope, which he\u2019s ingeniously connected to his laptop, where he has a program that takes pictures from the telescope and uploads them directly to the hard drive. Kara is impressed. Kenny starts talking about his suspicions about what life might be like on other worlds out in space. Kara answers knowingly, saying that she \u201cthinks\u201d it\u2019s probably just other people and families looking out at the stars asking the same questions. Kenny leans in for a kiss, and it looks like they might, but Kara gets nervous and stops. When Kenny says \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re my friend,\u201d Kara agrees.\n\nKara is late coming home from her night out with Kenny, and as she sneaks into her bedroom, Alex flips on the light, demanding to know where she\u2019s been. Kara doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s any of Alex\u2019s business, but Alex is pissed because she knows that she\u2019ll be the one who gets in trouble if Kara gets into trouble. Then it all comes out. Alex is pissed because when Kara arrived, she lost her father and had her whole world turned upside down. \u201cNow, all I have is you,\u201d Alex seethes. \u201cAnd you\u2019re not worth it.\u201d\n\nThe next morning at school, Kara picks up police chatter with her super-hearing. The body of a 17-year-old boy has been found in the woods. She immediately thinks of Kenny and races to the crime scene. She sees Kenny\u2019s body and screams as the police on the scene, including a Sheriff Collins, confirm that Kenny\u2019s been killed, and that she can\u2019t stay at an active crime scene.\n\nThe following day at school, Kenny\u2019s locker is covered in \u201cloving\u201d messages and hearts from students, and Kara stands in front of the display, completely resentful of the hypocrisy. None of these kids knew him, and many of them bullied or made fun of him, and yet now that he\u2019s dead, there\u2019s this outpouring. Kara remembers the telescope, the photos on the laptop\u2026and the football player that bullied Kenny.\n\nKara marches into the boys\u2019 locker room to confront the football player. She suspects that Kenny had something on him in one of the photos on his laptop, and thinks that the football player hurt Kenny in order to keep the secret. When she twists the football player\u2019s arm for answers, he squeals that he\u2019s smoked pot, and that Kenny knew, but that when Kenny was killed, he was home and his mother can vouch for him. Furious, Kara storms out.\n\nKara visits Kenny\u2019s parents to offer her condolences, and the police are there questioning his parents to see if Kenny had any enemies they knew about. When Kara arrives, Sargent Collins tries to have her leave, but she enters a conversation with Kenny\u2019s parents. His mother tells Kara that he always said such nice things about her. She then asks Kara about Kenny\u2019s telescope, which has gone missing and was his favorite thing. Kenny\u2019s dad bitterly says that it doesn\u2019t matter, because Kenny won\u2019t be needing it anymore. Kara promises to find it for them. However, as Sargent Collins walks her to the door, he warns her off such a dangerous case. She agrees to stop her search. Heh.\n\nCut to Kara in the woods looking for the telescope when she\u2019s startled by movement behind her. It\u2019s Alex. When Kara asks her why she\u2019s there, she reveals that Kenny used to tutor her in calculus, but kept it a secret, because he knew that Alex was embarrassed by it. Still, they too were friends, even if only in secret, and she came here to be closer to him. Kara tells Alex she\u2019s looking for the telescope, and knows that this is the last place where he had it, but it\u2019s not here. Alex encourages her to use her X-ray vision to find the laptop, and it occurs to Kara that perhaps Kenny had managed to take photos of something he wasn\u2019t supposed to see, and maybe that\u2019s what got him killed. Kara finds the laptop, and Alex says they need to get it home right away to find more evidence. She\u2019s already a budding detective.\n\nBack at home, Kara mentions that Clark has a friend named Chloe (whassup Smallville reference!) who might be able to access the encrypted photo files off the drive. They send those files to Chloe, but there are still plenty of photos that are already viewable. In addition to photos of stars, they come across a photo of Alex\u2019s friend Josie in a car in a romantic embrace with their history teacher, Mr. Bernard!\n\nThe next day, Alex confronts Josie about her relationship with Mr. Bernard, reminding her that what he\u2019s doing is statutory rape, but Josie isn\u2019t having it. She\u2019s in love with him, says they\u2019re in love with each other, and says that there\u2019s only ten years between them, and that in five years no one will even bat an eyelash at the age difference. Alex tells her that Mr. Bernard may have killed Kenny to keep their relationship secret, and that that\u2019s more important than keeping her secret. Josie is pissed and storms off, demanding that Alex not tell anyone.\n\nAlex and Kara walk home from school together (for the first time ever), talking about the case, when suddenly a car appears out of nowhere and tries to run them off the road. They would\u2019ve been killed were it not for the fact that Kara can fly and she and Alex were able to not fall off a rocky ledge. When Eliza and the police come to get them later, Alex tells Eliza that it was Mr. Bernard, because Josie must\u2019ve told him about the fact that Alex knows about their relationship and suspects him in Kenny\u2019s death.\n\nAt home, Eliza orders Alex to go do her homework while she talks to Kara. She reprimands Kara, telling her to drop this, because it\u2019s not up to her to have to save Alex, and that the thing she can do to help both Alex and herself stay safest is to not use her powers. But, since Kara might not listen to her, she\u2019s invited over reinforcements: FBI Agent Noel Neil (Erica Durance), who looks an awful lot like Alura. Kara is shocked at first, thinking her mother has somehow appeared, but Agent Neil says that she has \u201cone of those faces.\u201d She warns Kara that she needs to not use her powers anymore, that she\u2019s too young and needs to be \u201cnormal\u201d right now, not worrying about being a hero. Kara is frustrated and insists that she\u2019s not human, and never asked for these powers, but what good are they if she can\u2019t use them to help others. She says that Earth will never be home to her. Still, Agent Neil manages to calm her down, and Kara agrees that she won\u2019t use her powers anymore. When Agent Neil gets in her car to leave, we see that it was J\u2019onn who\u2019d shapeshifted into Alura-as-FBI-agent to guide Kara properly.\n\nThe next day, Josie confronts Alex for having gone to the authorities with information about her relationship with Mr. Bernard. Not only is Josie\u2019s dad (rightfully!) pissed, but the police arrested Mr. Bernard yesterday afternoon. Turns out, Josie was with him when she and Kara were walking home from school, meaning it wasn\u2019t him who ran them off the road! So\u2026who was it?\n\nAlex hurries home to tell Kara the new information, and is determined to find out who Kenny\u2019s killer is. Kara, however, is done. She\u2019s finally decided to hang up her powers, knowing that no matter what they do, Kenny will still be gone. Alex is disappointed in Kara, but remains determined and, ever the budding detective, goes off to find someone who\u2019ll help her.\n\nAlex finds Sargent Collins at a sports event and tells him that it wasn\u2019t Mr. Bernard who ran them off the road. She also tells him about the laptop that she and Kara found, and that they\u2019re in the process of getting the photos off of it, sure that Kenny\u2019s killer is in one of the photos. Sargent Collins asks her to follow him somewhere more quiet so they can continue to talk.\n\nMeanwhile, Kara receives the files from Chloe, and among the photos is one of Sargent Collins involved in a drug deal! Uh-oh\u2026\n\nNow alone in the stadium with Alex, Collins asks her what she knows about what\u2019s on the laptop as Alex starts to get antsy about suddenly being alone with him. Suddenly Kara calls, and Alex answers her phone. Kara tells her about Collins, and Alex tries to play it off like it was a casual call, but Collins pulls a gun on her. He knows what\u2019s up. He walks her deeper into the stadium basement, but not before calling the last number Alex dialed to see who it was, confirming that the call came from Kara at home, and hanging up the call.\n\nKara debates for, like, a milisecond as to whether she should use her powers to save Alex. She of course goes to save Alex. As she\u2019s flying there, Collins explains why he felt entitled to sell drugs (which, in a nice change of pace, came over the border\u2026from Canada!). Alex is way braver than he\u2019s expecting, and she keeps talking tough. Collins says that no one can hear her, but in a stunning display of faith Alex says that there\u2019s someone who can hear her, and who\u2019s coming. Kara bursts through the wall, stops Collins, and saves Alex.\n\nThe next day at school, Alex tries to talk to Josie, but Josie ignores her. Alex\u2019s friends disperse, and so Alex sits with Kara who, as usual, was alone. \u201cSo, we found out the douche quarterback was smoking pot, caught a predator, and solved a murder,\u201d Alex says. \u201cWe\u2019re doing pretty well this week. And everybody hates us.\u201d Kara mentions that there was one photo that Chloe pulled out of the files, but sent a hard copy of from Kenny\u2019s laptop: a photo of Kara in flight. He knew about her powers. He liked her, all of her, and kept her secret to himself. Kara regrets not kissing him. Alex asks Kara if she wants to hang out later, and Kara agrees. Alex apologizes for being so hard on her. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a sister,\u201d she says. \u201cI promise I\u2019ll get better at it.\u201d\n\nLater at home, Eliza gives them a delivery from Kenny\u2019s mother. They found the telescope and thought the girls should have it. Reconciled, and better friends and sisters for this shared experienced, the girls go to bed. END FLASHBACK.\n\nAdult Alex wakes up in her childhood bed and goes downstairs to find Kara on the porch with Kenny\u2019s telescope, which is still set up there. They talk about the Kenny situation, and how it was then that Alex realized what she and Kara could do together. Alex is glad that Kara brought her here, and Kara apologizes for having been closed-off about how she was dealing with her Mon-El feelings. She says that she\u2019s never felt at home on Earth, and that maybe she never will, but \u201cI feel at home when I\u2019m with you.\u201d They make up.\n\nAt the end of the weekend, they head back to National City with Eliza-packed snacks and with Alex driving, because Kara is apparently a crappy driver, and if anything happens to J\u2019onn\u2019s car, he\u2019ll kill them. As they drive away, Alex turns on some music, and they both sing along to \u201cSweet Escape.\u201d\n\nS3, EP. 6 \u2013 THE REVIEW\n\nThis is one of my favorite episodes of the show ever, and it\u2019s in large part due to the absolutely perfect casting of Young Alex and Young Kara. This episode was entirely dependent on those young actresses carrying the episode, and they did. Olivia Nikkanen was a revelation as Young Alex, and was a spot-on young Chyler Leigh not just looks-wise, but vocally. A couple of times, I closed my eyes and it sounded like I was listening to Leigh in the part. Nikkanen is also a strong actress in her own right, and struck an amazing balance between Alex\u2019s rage, her vulnerability, her determination in solving the case, and her ultimate loneliness and need to let Kara in.\n\nIzabela Vidovic was a perfect Kara, but whereas Nikkanen was a strong Alex vocally, Vidovic\u2019s strengths as Kara were more in her mannerisms and physicality. She embodied a young Supergirl perfectly, and also brought the right balance of sweetness and bitterness to a teenage Kara Danvers. The girls had amazing chemistry with each other, too, and were a pleasure to watch.\n\nAgain, the episode was a welcome respite from the intense episodes that preceded it this season. It kind of felt like a Veronica Mars episode, which I mean as a total compliment. All the teen characters were nuanced and written with a huge amount of respect. Kara and Kenny\u2019s relationship read immediately within a couple of lines of dialogue, which is hugely important as whether we\u2019re invested in Kara caring about his death is dependent on the viewer buying their feelings for each other. Ivan Mok\u2019s Kenny was a geeky sweetheart with depth, and the idea of that lost potential, of Kara never having kissed or dated him, was really sad.\n\nI\u2019ve also gotta big up the fact that Kara\u2019s romantic interest was a handsome Asian kid. It\u2019s all-too-rare for Asian men in particular to be cast as romantic leads, so it was nice to see the show cast this way for Kara. And speaking of inclusion, I noticed that Midvale has a lot of PoCs living in it. For example, see the cafeteria photo above. Kara is surrounded by PoC in that scene, and while there are plenty of white people in Midvale as you might expect, I noticed that there was a strong effort made to ensure that the background actors weren\u2019t completely lily-white.\n\nAs for the adult side of the episode, I always love watching Melissa Benoist and Chyler Leigh have scenes together, as they have created such a beautiful, multi-faceted relationship for Kara and Alex over the past three seasons. I was happy that the characters were given the opportunity to, as Eliza said, \u201clean into\u201d their painful feelings and recognize when they were being closed off.\n\nI loved that \u201cMidvale\u201d was an episode entirely devoted to the moment in time that the Danvers sisters actually became the Danvers sisters, and it makes so much sense that this episode happened after both Kara and Alex have lost their significant others. \u201cMidvale\u201d reminds us that romantic relationships will come and go for these two, but the OTP of this show will always be Kara and Alex. They are the true love story of Supergirl.\n\nDid you enjoy this glimpse into Kara and Alex\u2019s childhood?

Photo: Courtesy of Instagram/daniellellombard; Courtesy of Instagram/ashleylynnrosenbaum\n\nTonight, the improbable 21st season of The Bachelor comes to a close. Only one woman will walk away with everlasting love, but all of the contestants will get the opportunity to reach for something greater: free money.\n\nRelated Stories A History of The Bachelor, by the People Who Lived It\n\nWhether they were sent home in the first few weeks or made it all the way to the final rose ceremony, every contestant will enter the amorphous reality-TV-personality-slash-social-media-influencer economy, which, in 2017, is booming. Since contestants are not paid to appear on The Bachelor, the best chance to capitalize on their newfound visibility is right after the show. The stars and contestants do not want to appear too thirsty for fame, of course \u2014 they went on The Bachelor to \u201cfind love\u201d \u2014 but time is of the essence. In a few months, a new season of the show will premiere, and there will be 25 new contestants for the public to follow. The best brand partnerships are being negotiated right now. And the only way for contestants to extend their time in the spotlight is to keep making deals and sharing their lives with the public.\n\nSo how much money can stars and contestants make? And how, exactly, do they cash in? We talked to a few members of the Bachelor franchise to find out.\n\n\u201cFlat Tummy Tea and Teeth Whitening\u201d\n\nSocial-media endorsement deals with brands are some of the most popular ways contestants cash in on their fame. Instagram is the main platform for this, likely because that is where Bachelor stars tend to build the biggest following (you know their faces, not necessarily their names). Kaitlyn Bristowe, who served as the Bachelorette in 2015, said she was bombarded with Instagram offers as soon as she left the show (happily, in the arms of her fiance Shawn Booth).\n\n\u201cOvernight you have this huge following, so all these brands are like, \u2018Here, do you want to work with us?\u2019\u201d she told me in a phone interview. \u201cSo you get offers to do the Flat Tummy Tea and the teeth whitening and all that. For somebody who has worked a regular job before, you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh my gosh, you\u2019re going to pay me to do that? Glorious.\u2019\u201d Kaitlyn chose to partner with brands like Palm Bay cocktails, Smartfood popcorn, and TRESemm\u00e9.\n\nThese kinds of ads, which have proliferated across social media over the last five years, are pretty easy to spot. They all feature slightly ham-fisted product placement, obviously pre-written captions, and specific hashtags like, #VolumeRevolution #TRESemmePartner. Reality-TV stars can reportedly make $1,500 to $7,000 for each simple photo, depending on their follower count. And Bachelor and Bachelorette leads are not the only ones to book these kinds of deals: Even contestants who were only briefly on the show can rack up multiple clients.\n\nFor example, when the current Bachelor, Nick Viall, sent contestant Danielle Lombard home just a few weeks into this season, she immediately got to work. Since her departure from the show just five weeks ago, she has posted advertisements for BootayBag panties, Weekend Vice clothing, Bombay Hair \u201crose gold\u201d curling irons (for \u201cthose Victoria Secret Voluminous Waves!\u201d), DIFF sunglasses, Muddy Body face masks, Glam Seamless hair extensions, FabFitFun subscription boxes, Away luggage, Drip Doctors on-demand IV therapy (for \u201cimmunity\u201d), and the JetSmarter app.\n\nLucky for Danielle, she probably will not have to keep all those ads on her feed, should she later regret posting them. Oftentimes, brand contracts will stipulate that stars can delete the posts after a certain amount of time. Kaitlyn, for her part, said it takes time to find the right Instagram ad balance. \u201cI have turned down money to stay true to who I am and brands that I want to work with,\u201d she explained.\n\nTo Dance or Not to Dance With the Stars\n\nOne of the most coveted opportunities for a Bachelor star is an appearance on ABC\u2019s Dancing With the Stars. It is added exposure, and the \u201ccelebrities\u201d on the show are paid well: They reportedly make six-figure base salaries and bonuses for every week they stay in the competition. In the past, three Bachelors, one Bachelorette, and one Bachelor contestant have scored placement on the show, and this season, Nick will join their ranks. His announcement about joining the show, however, was met with controversy.\n\nWhen news of Nick\u2019s casting broke, Kaitlyn claimed on Twitter that Bachelor creator Mike Fleiss prevented her from doing Dancing With the Stars after her run as the Bachelorette. \u201cActually I was offered it, had the contract & Mike Fliess [sic] told me I wasn\u2019t allowed. He said he didnt want people wanting fame after his show,\u201d she tweeted.\n\nActually I was offered it, had the contract & Mike Fliess told me I wasn't allowed.He said he didnt want people wanting fame after his show\ud83e\udd14 https://t.co/nSzricohi4 \u2014 Kaitlyn Bristowe (@kaitlynbristowe) February 27, 2017\n\nThe Bachelor creator did not comment on the accusation and instead responded on Twitter, \u201c@kaitlynbristowe has my total support if she wants to appear on DWTS!!! #TheBachelor.\u201d This did not pacify Kaitlyn; she pointed out that the opportunity was no longer available to her. \u201cThanks I\u2019ll get right on that opportunity 2 yrs ago. I wonder what changed your mind?\u201d she tweeted. (We reached out to representatives for Fleiss for comment and will update if we hear back.)\n\nThe controversy shows the fraught position Bachelor and Bachelorette stars find themselves in after the show. They do not want to seem too fame-hungry (they are supposed to be settling down with a fianc\u00e9!), but if they do not aggressively pursue opportunities right away, they risk losing out on cash.\n\nChris Soules, a Bachelor who appeared on Dancing With the Stars in 2015, said in a phone interview that Bachelor producers \u201chave a say in almost everything you do afterwards,\u201d because stars remain under contract for a year after the show. He added that he was surprised to hear Kaitlyn\u2019s story. \u201cI sort of knew that [Mike Fleiss] could approve or disapprove most anything, but I just figured it\u2019s ABC \u2026 they\u2019re a pretty important company to Mike Fleiss so I just assumed that he was indifferent if the contestants went on.\u201d\n\nKaitlyn told me she would still \u201clove to know why\u201d she was not allowed to dance with the stars, but she has moved on. \u201cI\u2019m going to be starting my podcast soon, and living in Nashville, I\u2019ve been songwriting and singing so that\u2019s really fun,\u201d she revealed. She said she has recorded three songs and ultimately hopes to release an album.\n\nTelevised Weddings and Couples Therapy\n\nDancing With the Stars is not the only reality-TV option for stars post-Bachelor. After his season of The Bachelor in 2016, Ben Higgins booked an unscripted-scripted Freeform reality show with his fianc\u00e9e titled Ben and Lauren: Happily Ever After. The show was as boring and unmemorable as its stars, and it did not get picked up for a second season. Ben\u2019s best chance to earn another paycheck from his Bachelor fame? Marry Lauren on television.\n\nA televised wedding is the most logical next step for a successful Bachelor or Bachelorette couple. To date, five couples have married in front of their family, friends, and millions of ABC viewers: Trista and Ryan Sutter (The Bachelorette, season 1), Jason and Molly Mesnick (The Bachelor, season 13), Ashley and JP Rosenbaum (The Bachelorette, season 7), Sean and Catherine Lowe (The Bachelor, season 17), and Jade and Tanner Tolbert (Bachelor in Paradise, season 2). All of them stressed, in one way or another, that they just wanted to continue sharing their journey with fans, and that made getting paid to get married on TV sound a bit more romantic. Trista and Ryan, who were the first couple in Bachelor history to marry, reportedly pulled in $1 million for a three-episode wedding special in 2003, while Sean and Catherine reportedly made six figures for a one-episode special in 2014.\n\nAfter a televised wedding, of course, comes televised couples therapy. Sean and Catherine and Jade and Tanner appeared on separate seasons of WeTV\u2019s chaotic couples therapy program Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars. It is a Real World\u2013style setup that involves five couples undergoing marriage counseling in the same house, while drinking a lot. When I interviewed Jade and Tanner at a Marriage Boot Camp premiere last year, they confirmed that they started filming the show just three months after their wedding. They considered it a positive experience.\n\n\u201cI guess, you know, we didn\u2019t look at it as a negative thing like, \u2018Our marriage is in trouble,\u201d Jade said. \u201cWe\u2019re more like, \u2018Let\u2019s learn from these couples now so we don\u2019t have problems later.\u2019 Because both of us come from divorced families \u2026 we really want to get through everything together. And so we just felt like, why not? We\u2019ve done everything else on TV!\u201d\n\nIn a blog post after his season of the show aired in 2015, Sean was more direct. \u201cI\u2019ll admit it: I did it for the money,\u201d he wrote. Both couples are still married, so maybe it was worth it.\n\nBrand-Friendly Babies\n\nFive married Bachelor couples have stayed together long enough to have children, and those babies have become part of the social-media-influencer economy, too. Last year, I met Sean and Catherine at a baby shower for their first child, and the whole event was sponsored by Dreft baby detergent. Like fellow Bachelor parents JP and Ashley, Sean and Catherine have featured their baby in Instagram ads for brands like HelloFresh and Teami Blends tea.\n\nDesiree and Chris Siegfried, who married after season nine of The Bachelorette, recently placed their son in an ad for Pace Salsa. (Caption: #ad It\u2019s Asher\u2019s first Taco Tuesday!)\n\nJade and Tanner, meanwhile, just became pregnant with their first child. Immediately after announcing the good news on Instagram, Jade posted an ad for the Ava fertility tracker, which she credited for helping her get pregnant quickly.\n\nThese five couples represent a vast minority of Bachelor and Bachelorette stars who have managed to continue to make money for years after their appearances on the show by sharing more and more of their lives with the public. Families used to pass down farms or dental practices through the generations, but now, we\u2019ve reached an age where reality-TV stars are bequeathing social-media-influencer status to their children. Perhaps, when these brand-friendly babies grow up, they\u2019ll appear on The Bachelor themselves, to continue the tradition.\n\nWatch the video below to see some on-set secrets about what goes on behind the scenes of The Bachelor."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Loading the player...\n\nPrince William to miss FA Cup final for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding The Duke of Cambridge is President of the Football Association\n\nPrince William is widely expected to skip the FA Cup final on Saturday 19 May in order to attend the wedding of his brother Prince Harry to Meghan Markle. The Duke, who is President of the Football Association, would normally attend the highly anticipated match, as he has done in previous years, but it seems William is putting family first.\n\nThe FA has yet to announce the start time for the match at Wembley, north London. Kick-off is usually at 5:30pm but given that the game may run into extra time, it wouldn't be possible for William to be in two places at once. His brother's wedding will be held at noon at St George's Chapel in Windsor, followed by a reception in St George's Hall and an evening party at nearby Frogmore House, a 45-minute drive away from the football stadium.\n\nWilliam is widely expected to skip the FA Cup final\n\nWilliam was said to be struggling to see if he could attend both events, but it's likely he will put his wedding duties first. The future King is expected to act as Harry's best man, although royal weddings do not technically have 'best men'. According to Marlene Koenig, a British and European royalty expert, the best man or best men at royal weddings are officially called 'supporters'. \"William will probably be Harry's supporter,\" said Marlene.\n\nMORE: Everything you need to know about the royal wedding\n\nWhen Prince Charles married Princess Diana in 1981, he asked his brothers Prince Andrew and Prince Edward to be his 'supporters', and similarly Edward asked his two older siblings to support him on his own wedding day. However, it's thought William actually broke tradition for his own 2011 nuptials and did appoint Harry to be his official 'best man'.\n\nThe wedding venue, St George's Chapel, is a 45-minute drive away from Wembley stadium\n\nMORE: The difference between Kate and Meghan's wedding invites\n\nIt's highly unlikely that William's wife Kate will be included in Meghan's bridal party. The Duchess, who will have just welcomed her third child, will want to avoid taking any attention away from the bride and the groom; she kept a low-profile at sister Pippa Middleton's wedding in May for similar reasons. But her children Prince George and Princess Charlotte \u2013 Harry's niece and nephew \u2013 will likely act as pageboy and bridesmaid respectively, much like they did at auntie Pippa's wedding."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Rey is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise portrayed by English actress Daisy Ridley. First appearing as the main character in Star Wars: Episode VII \u2013 The Force Awakens, Rey is a scavenger who was left behind on the planet Jakku when she was a child, and later becomes involved with the Resistance's conflict with the First Order when her solitary life is interrupted by BB-8, the droid of ace Resistance pilot Poe Dameron, and a runaway Stormtrooper named Finn.\n\nDevelopment [ edit ]\n\nCreation and casting [ edit ]\n\nEpisode VII Rey's costume from\n\nScreenwriter Michael Arndt said that he found Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy's offer to write the Star Wars sequel trilogy daunting in mid-2012, but he became interested when it was explained to him that the tale was about the origin story of a female Jedi and he met with George Lucas. The character was a young woman known as Kira in the early stages of production, and Arndt described her as a \"loner, hothead, gear-head, badass\". Arndt said that he struggled with introducing the young woman as the main character in his story while keeping her from being overshadowed after her early meeting with the Luke Skywalker character. Ridley recalled that director and writer J. J. Abrams originally intended to name the character \"Keera\", however during filming in Abu Dhabi, Abrams revealed to Ridley that he was thinking of going with \"Rey\".\n\nOn creating a female lead for the new trilogy, Abrams stated that from his initial discussions with writer Lawrence Kasdan, he was excited at the concept of having a woman at the center of the story. He said that \"We always wanted to write Rey as the central character\" and that other female representation in the story was also important. Kennedy stated that, \"Rey is the new generation's Luke Skywalker.\" Rey's background as a scavenger was part of the developers attempting to portray her as \"the ultimate outsider and the ultimate disenfranchised person\", due to their belief that a person of that nature would likely experience a prolonged journey compared to other types of people.\n\nDaisy Ridley was largely unknown before being cast for the role of Rey. Ridley said that she auditioned many times for the role over the course of seven months and had to keep her casting a secret for three months. She was announced as part of the cast at the end of April 2014. She only had experience with small parts in TV shows. Her inexperience and lack of exposure were a crucial part of what convinced Abrams to give Ridley the role, as the previous installments had featured relatively unknown talent that would not experience heightened degrees of scrutiny. Abrams stated that Ridley \"was so funny and had a great spark\", as well as having her act out an emotional scene, proclaiming that \"she nailed it on the first take.\" Abrams would go on to praise Ridley, stating \"She was born with this gift to be in a moment and make it her own. She simultaneously works from the inside out and the outside in.\" Kennedy proclaimed \"Daisy had a physicality and a self-confidence that was so important to the character we were looking for. She epitomizes that optimism where anything is possible.\" Director Dusan Lazarevic, who was present at the casting of Ridley for a role in British drama series Silent Witness, in addition to praising her acting range, stated \"She showed a combination of vulnerability and strength which gave her a complexity, and there was an intelligence in her eyes that was an indicator she could play quite a complicated part.\" Cailey Fleming was additionally cast to portray a young Rey.\n\nAlthough Ridley expressed that she was \"riddled with doubts and insecurities\", she stated that Rey's hopefulness is what she related to most in Rey, going on to say it \"was something driving me through the auditions\u2014even though it felt so insanely out of anything that I could've imagined.\" Ridley recalled her shooting experience as starting off bumpy, with Abrams telling her that her first few takes were \"wooden\". However, Ridley and Abrams had an \"incredibly collaborative\" process with creating Rey; Ridley recalled that the character \"changed from when we first began, she became softer. And I think that's probably me, because Americans tend not to understand me, so it helped, slowing down the speech and everything just made it softer than I am.\" On her character, Ridley has stated that Rey will have \"some impact in a girl power-y way\", adding that the character \"doesn't have to be one thing to embody a woman in a film. It just so happens she's a woman but she transcends gender. She's going to speak to men and women.\" In an interview with Elle, Ridley would continue describing her character, \"She's so strong. She's cool and smart and she can look after herself,\" adding \"Young girls can look at her and know that they can wear trousers if they want to. That they don't have to show off their bodies.\"\n\nComposer John Williams said that he immediately loved Ridley in the film and that he found composing Rey's theme an interesting challenge. He said that her theme doesn't suggest a love theme, but rather a strong female adventurer character infused with the Force for a mature, thoughtful theme. Williams expressed that the \"musical grammar\" of Rey's theme is not heroic, but instead conveys an adventurous tone that needs to illustrate empathy.\"\n\nCharacterization [ edit ]\n\nRey is introduced as a 19-year-old woman in The Force Awakens. Rey is stubborn, headstrong, brave, optimistic, and maintains fierce loyalty to her friends. In comparison to Luke, Matthew Yglesias of Vox said that \"Rey is considerably less callow than Luke\".\n\nMegan Garber of The Atlantic argued that Rey \"proves herself to be, in extremely short order, extremely adept as a fighter\". Rey is highly Force-sensitive, which is revealed when she is presented with the lightsaber first owned by Anakin Skywalker, then his son Luke Skywalker. Without training, she is able to use advanced Force abilities and even defeat Kylo Ren in a duel, though he was already injured and using his power of the dark side to fight being weakened by his pain.\n\nAppearances [ edit ]\n\nFilm [ edit ]\n\nThe Force Awakens (2015) [ edit ]\n\nRey lives alone on the planet Jakku, scraping a living through scavenging parts from ships while awaiting the return of the family that she was separated from as a child. She rescues the astromech droid BB-8 and encounters the runaway stormtrooper Finn. Attacked by First Order troops, Rey steals and pilots the Millennium Falcon to evade them and escape Jakku. The smuggler Han Solo and his partner Chewbacca capture the Falcon in their freighter ship. When dangerous gangs confront Han on the freighter, Rey mistakenly unleashes Han's vicious cargo. She saves Finn and they escape the freighter in the Falcon. Impressed with Rey, Han offers her a job on the Falcon; however, Rey declines his offer, feeling that she has to return to Jakku.\n\nAfter they convene at Maz Kanata's castle on the planet Takodana to return BB-8 to the Resistance, the First Order is alerted to their presence. Rey is drawn to the castle's basement vault in which Maz has stored a lightsaber that belonged to Luke Skywalker and his father before him. Upon touching it, she experiences a terrifying vision: she sees a battle led by Kylo Ren, a flashback of her younger self being left behind on Jakku, and a vision of Luke, the last Jedi Master in the galaxy, who has been missing for several years. Maz argues that whoever abandoned her will never return to Jakku, and her only option is to seek out strength in the Force. Feeling overwhelmed, Rey rejects the lightsaber and flees into the forest.\n\nThe First Order attacks Maz's castle, and Ren captures Rey when the Resistance arrives. Ren takes her to Starkiller Base, where he probes her mind for the map piece that BB-8 showed her. Ren uses the Force to read Rey's mind, revealing Rey feels that Han is like the father she never had. Rey then resists him and reads Ren's emotions, exposing his fear that he will never be as powerful as Darth Vader. Ren reports to his master, Supreme Leader Snoke, who commands that Rey be brought before him. Left alone with a stormtrooper guarding her, Rey uses a Jedi mind trick to get him to help free her. After sneaking around inside the base looking for a way to escape, she is elated to find Finn, Han, and Chewbacca have come for her. They watch in horror as Ren kills his own father, Han.\n\nAs they try to escape the base through the forest, Ren challenges Rey and Finn, using his lightsaber. After Ren seriously injures Finn and disarms him of Luke's lightsaber, Rey uses the Force to retrieve the weapon and battles the already wounded Ren. Initially overpowered, Rey rejects Ren's offer to train her and uses the Force with the lightsaber to defeat him. After escaping the destroyed planet in the Millennium Falcon with Chewbacca and the wounded Finn, she returns to the Resistance base. While the Resistance celebrates the victory, Rey mourns Han's death with Leia Organa and visits Finn, who is still unconscious. She decides to seek out Luke's location, using information provided by BB-8 and the re-activated R2-D2. Rey, Chewbacca, and R2 travel in the Falcon to the oceanic planet of Ahch-To; upon finding Luke, Rey presents him with his lost lightsaber.\n\nRelated works and merchandising [ edit ]\n\nRey is featured in Star Wars: Before the Awakening (2015) by Greg Rucka, an anthology book for young readers that focuses on the lives of Poe, Rey and Finn before the events of The Force Awakens. Rey's Survival Guide (2015) by Jason Fry is a first-person account from Rey's perspective about herself and her home planet of Jakku. Rey is also a point of view character in the 2015 novelization of The Force Awakens by Alan Dean Foster.\n\nFans noticed a lack of tie-in toys featuring Rey. Hasbro released a version of Monopoly based on The Force Awakens that excluded the Rey character. After receiving criticism, Hasbro stated that they did not include Rey to avoid revealing spoilers, and would be including Rey in future toy releases. Paul Southern, the head of Lucasfilm licensing, said that they wanted to protect the secrets that \"the Force awakens in Rey\" and that her character carries a lightsaber. He said that demand for Rey products was underestimated. Abrams said, \"I will say that it seems preposterous and wrong that the main character of the movie is not well represented in what is clearly a huge piece of the Star Wars world in terms of merchandising.\" Regarding Rey's relative absence in Star Wars merchandising, CBBC presenter and voice actor Christopher Johnson stated: \"It still baffles me to this day that some toy manufacturers don't think that girls want to play with 'superhero' toys and that boys aren't interested in female characters.\"\n\nThe Last Jedi (2017) [ edit ]\n\nRey is one of the central characters of The Last Jedi. Picking up directly where The Force Awakens left off, Rey presents Luke with his lightsaber, but Luke dismissively throws it aside and ignores Rey. She tells him that she has come on behalf of Leia and the Resistance to bring him home and end the fight against the First Order. Luke rejects this, and asks Rey why she personally came to Ahch-To. She confides in him her experiences with the Force, and tells him that she is afraid of her own abilities and potential. Luke eventually agrees to give Rey three lessons of the ways of the Force. Through these lessons, Rey demonstrates immense raw strength and a clear temptation toward the dark side of the Force that reminds Luke of Kylo Ren, who was once his nephew and student, Ben Solo. All the while, Rey feels a sudden connection through the Force with Ren, who tells her that Luke tried to kill him while he was the Jedi master\u2019s student (Luke later tells her that he was tempted to kill Ben after seeing a vision of the pain and suffering he would cause, but relented). In one of their conversations, Rey and Ren touch hands, and through this Rey swears that she is able to feel conflict within Ren, and becomes determined to turn him back to the light side. Rey asks Luke once more to come with her and rejoin the Resistance, but when he refuses, Rey, Chewbacca, and R2-D2 leave without him.\n\nRen takes Rey prisoner and brings her before Snoke. Snoke tells her that he created the Force connection between her and Ren as a trap to reach Luke. Snoke tortures and taunts Rey, showing her the attack on the Resistance transports, and eventually orders Ren to kill her. Ren instead kills Snoke, and he and Rey fight Snoke's guards side by side. The duel won, Ren asks Rey to join him and create a new order separate from the legacies of Snoke and Luke, but Rey refuses. In an attempt to get her to turn, Ren gets Rey to admit what she had always known all along and had hidden it away for years: Rey's parents were \"nobody\", and, in Ren's words, were two-bit junk dealers who sold her off for drinking money, and are long dead. Despite the revelation, Rey refuses to join him and uses the Force to summon Luke's lightsaber, but Ren does so, too, resulting in a standoff that ultimately tears the lightsaber in two. Shortly afterwards, Resistance leader Vice Admiral Holdo rams her cruiser into Snoke's flagship, separating Rey from Ren.\n\nRey is later revealed to have made her way back to the Millennium Falcon, manning the guns as Chewbacca pilots, aiding the Resistance in fighting the First Order\u2019s troops. Despite their best efforts, the battle turns out to be a loss for the Resistance, and Rey focuses her efforts on finding the surviving Resistance fighters to help evacuate them. Eventually, she finds the Resistance fighters behind a dead end, and uses the Force to move the rocky barrier aside, clearing the path for them to board the Falcon. Rey reunites with Finn and Leia, and meets Poe Dameron for the first time aboard the Falcon. Rey feels Luke\u2019s death through the Force, and reassures Leia that he met his end with \"peace and purpose\". As she holds the remains of Luke's lightsaber, Rey asks Leia how they can rebuild the Resistance from what remains, and Leia, gesturing towards Rey, says that they now have all they need. Unknown to Leia, that includes the fact that Rey stole the sacred Jedi texts from Luke before he decided to burn them, thus enabling her to learn the ways of the Force by herself.\n\nTelevision [ edit ]\n\nStar Wars Rebels (2014)\n\nRey makes a brief cameo as a disembodied voice in the television series Star Wars Rebels, in the episode \"A World Between Worlds\". In the episode, set 16 years before her birth and 35 years before The Force Awakens, the young padawan Ezra Bridger briefly hears some of her lines from the film (specifically her speaking to the unconscious Finn at the end) in the World Between Worlds, a dimension that exists outside of time and space.\n\nForces of Destiny (2017) [ edit ]\n\nRey stars in the micro-series Star Wars Forces of Destiny, voiced by Daisy Ridley.\n\nVideo games [ edit ]\n\nThe character of Rey appears in the video games Disney Infinity 3.0, Lego Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and Star Wars Battlefront II (2017), both voiced by Ridley, as well as the strategy video game Star Wars: Force Arena.\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nGeneral [ edit ]\n\nThe character and Ridley's portrayal have received critical acclaim. Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal proclaimed that Rey is \"a woman warrior with the stylish ferocity of a kung-fu star\", praising \"the verve [Ridley] must have been born with plus the skill she must have acquired as a young actress coming up in England\", later adding \"It's hard to imagine what the movie\u2014and the sequels to come\u2014might have been if they'd cast the wrong person, but here Daisy Ridley is in all her unassuming glory, and all's right with the galaxy\". Adam Howard of MSNBC stated that \"one of the most pleasant surprises of the film has been the strength of its lead female character\", adding that some have likened Rey to a \"new feminist icon\". Relatedly, Emily Rome of HitFix argued that Rey is \"everything we wanted in a Star Wars female character\", praising her for being a character that is \"independent, skilled, scrappy, tough, and doesn't need saving\". In a personal essay, Nicole Sperling of Entertainment Weekly wrote about her daughters feeling empowered after viewing the film, stating, \"They never commented on how pretty Rey is. They never had to flinch because Rey was a sexual object to some man in power. They just felt strong. Equal\".\n\nSome fans expressed opinions that Rey is too skilled, despite her inexperience during The Force Awakens, making her a \"Mary Sue\"-type character. Rome wrote that \"the speed with which Rey mastered Jedi mind tricks and lightsaber fighting with zero training is the stuff of fan fiction. Rey is geek feminist wish-fulfillment\". Tasha Robinson of The Verge said that Rey \"keeps falling into standard-issue damsel-in-distress situations, then capably rescuing herself\". Robinson conceded, \"let's face it, Rey is kind of a Mary Sue character\". However, Robinson went on write: \"She's a fantasy wish-fulfillment character with outsized skills, an inhuman reaction time, and a clever answer to every question\u2014but so are the other major Star Wars heroes.\" Other outlets have argued that the term Mary Sue carries an inherent gender bias, and that categorizing Rey as one holds her to a double standard as the male characters from the original trilogy did not face comparable criticism. Caroline Framke of Vox wrote \"While my kneejerk reaction to criticism of Rey was that it's absolutely in the wrong, I have to admit that questioning her merits isn't inherently misogynistic. The real problem is that there's an undeniable false equivalence at play\".\n\nRey's unique hairstyle attracted attention before and after The Force Awakens was released, being compared to Leia's hairdo during the original trilogy with debate over whether it would become as popular. Rey has also been compared to the character Nausicaa, from the 1984 Hayao Miyazaki anime film Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind, including a generally similar personality and strikingly similar headwear.[50]\n\nRichard Roeper described Ridley's portrayal of Rey as \"a breakout performance\", continuing by calling the character \"tough and resourceful and smart and brave\". Ridley was nominated for a 2016 Saturn Award for Best Actress for her portrayal. The first Reel Women in Technology Award for a fictional character was awarded to the character Rey.\n\nParentage [ edit ]\n\nThe question of Rey's parentage has been a significant point of discussion for the series, and has spawned numerous fan theories. The most popular theories are that she is the daughter of Luke Skywalker or Han Solo, or is Obi-Wan Kenobi's granddaughter (because of a scene where Rey hears Kenobi's echoed voice following a vision in The Force Awakens). The view that she is Luke's daughter is especially prominent, with fans and critics highlighting their story arc similarities, Star Wars being a Skywalker saga, Rey having a strong attachment to Luke's lightsaber, and being exceptionally strong with the Force without any training. Some fan theories about Rey's parentage pointed to \"Rey's Theme\" featured in John Williams' score of The Force Awakens, as the theme shared similarities with the themes for Darth Vader and Luke.\n\nAbrams stated that he intentionally withheld Rey's last name and background in The Force Awakens. He said that he felt that the origin of Kylo Ren was the only thing that could be revealed in his film and that he knew \"quite a bit\" about Rey's origin but would give courtesy to Star Wars: The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson by not saying any more. Former Star Wars: Episode IX director Colin Trevorrow stated that the answer of Rey's origin would be \"deeply and profoundly satisfying\" and that Rey is \"important in this universe, not just in the context of The Force Awakens, but in the entire galaxy. She deserves it.\" Ridley said that she knew who Rey's parents were.\n\nIn The Last Jedi, a conversation between Rey and Kylo Ren reveals that Rey's parents were insignificant. Rey is coaxed by Kylo into admitting they were \"nobody\", a revelation that Kylo tells Rey she already knew. Todd VanDerWerff of Vox equated this scene with Luke finding out that Darth Vader is his father, which was his greatest nightmare. To VanDerWerff, \"Rey's greatest nightmare is being no one.\" He added that Kylo Ren \"has every reason to be lying\" in this instance because \"he's trying to get Rey to let the past\u2014Jedi, Sith, Rebellion, Empire, First Order, etc., etc., etc.\u2014crumble to dust,\" but that \"in a weird way, it's a kind of meta-commentary on a franchise that is seeking a new future, while still being indebted enough to its past that it continually recycles itself.\" He said that it is a good thing that \"Rey is the child of nobody of particular importance to the story so far.\" Josh Spiegel of The Hollywood Reporter stated that although some fans may be disappointed by the reveal that Rey's parents are nobodies, \"it fits in perfectly with the message Rian Johnson sends all the way to the very last scene\" which is that \"knowing that Rey is both exceptionally gifted in the Force and also not a Skywalker or someone along those bloodlines emphasizes\" that \"the spirit of the Jedi extends beyond those like Luke, to anyone with a gift and the power to believe.\"\n\nConversely, although Casey Cipriani of Bustle recognized that Kylo Ren might be right about Rey's parents, she opined that he is \"unreliable\" and that \"we have to take what he says with a grain of salt and look elsewhere [within the story] for hints of Rey's lineage.\"\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nCitations [ edit ]\n\nSources [ edit ]"}

A hidden flash drive found in Jason's (Trevor Stines) varsity jacket revealed footage from the Whyte Wyrm's basement that confirmed Clifford Blossom shot his own son in the head.\n\nIt took several twists and turns to get to the truth, though. The first gut punch was FP Jones (Skeet Ulrich) confessing to the crime Archie (KJ Apa) and his friends knew he didn't commit.

It turns out that Veronica's father is guilty of many things, but murder isn't one of them.\n\nMeanwhile, it turns out FP confessed because Clifford had threatened to harm Jughead (Cole Sprouse) if he didn't take the rap for the crime.

{"label": true, "txt": "This article is about the American actor. For the seismologist, see Thomas C. Hanks\n\nThomas Jeffrey Hanks (born July 9, 1956) is an American actor and filmmaker. Hanks is known for his comedic and dramatic roles in such films as Splash (1984), Big (1988), Turner & Hooch (1989), A League of Their Own (1992), Sleepless in Seattle (1993), Apollo 13 (1995), You've Got Mail (1998), The Green Mile (1999), Cast Away (2000), Road to Perdition (2002), Cloud Atlas (2012), Captain Phillips (2013), Saving Mr. Banks (2013), and Sully (2016). He has also starred in the Robert Langdon film series, and voices Sheriff Woody in the Toy Story film series.\n\nHanks has collaborated with film director Steven Spielberg on five films to date: Saving Private Ryan (1998), Catch Me If You Can (2002), The Terminal (2004), Bridge of Spies (2015), and The Post (2017), as well as the 2001 miniseries Band of Brothers, which launched Hanks as a successful director, producer, and screenwriter. In 2010, Spielberg and Hanks were executive producers on the HBO miniseries The Pacific.\n\nHanks' films have grossed more than $4.5 billion at U.S. and Canadian box offices and more than $9.0 billion worldwide,[2] making him the fourth highest-grossing actor in North America.[3] Hanks has been nominated for numerous awards during his career. He won a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Philadelphia (1993), as well as a Golden Globe, an Academy Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and a People's Choice Award for Best Actor for Forrest Gump (1994). In 1995, Hanks became one of only two actors who won the Academy Award for Best Actor in consecutive years, with Spencer Tracy being the other.[4] In 2004, he received the Stanley Kubrick Britannia Award for Excellence in Film from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA).[5] In 2014, he received a Kennedy Center Honor, and in 2016, he received a Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama,[6] as well as the French Legion of Honor.[7]\n\nEarly life\n\nThomas Jeffrey Hanks[8] was born in Concord, California on July 9, 1956,[9][10] to hospital worker Janet Marylyn (n\u00e9e Frager)[11] and itinerant cook Amos Mefford Hanks.[10][12][13] His mother was of Portuguese descent (her family's surname was originally \"Fraga\"),[14] while his father had English ancestry.[15][16] His parents divorced in 1960. Their three oldest children, Sandra (later Sandra Hanks Benoiton, a writer),[17] Larry (an entomology professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign),[18] and Tom, went with their father, while the youngest, Jim (who also became an actor and filmmaker), remained with their mother in Red Bluff, California.[19] In his childhood, Hanks' family moved often; by the age of 10, he had lived in 10 different houses.[20]\n\nWhile Hanks' family religious history was Catholic and Mormon, he has characterized his teenage self as being a \"Bible-toting evangelical\" for several years.[21] In school, he was unpopular with students and teachers alike, later telling Rolling Stone magazine, \"I was a geek, a spaz. I was horribly, painfully, terribly shy. At the same time, I was the guy who'd yell out funny captions during filmstrips. But I didn't get into trouble. I was always a real good kid and pretty responsible.\"[22] In 1965, his father married Frances Wong, a San Francisco native of Chinese descent. Frances had three children, two of whom lived with Hanks during his high school years. Hanks acted in school plays, including South Pacific, while attending Skyline High School in Oakland, California.[23]\n\nHanks studied theater at Chabot College in Hayward, California, and transferred to California State University, Sacramento, two years later.[24] During a 2001 interview with Bob Costas, Hanks was asked whether he would rather have an Oscar or a Heisman Trophy. He replied he would rather win a Heisman by playing halfback for the California Golden Bears.[25] He told New York magazine in 1986, \"Acting classes looked like the best place for a guy who liked to make a lot of noise and be rather flamboyant. I spent a lot of time going to plays. I wouldn't take dates with me. I'd just drive to a theater, buy myself a ticket, sit in the seat and read the program, and then get into the play completely. I spent a lot of time like that, seeing Brecht, Tennessee Williams, Ibsen, and all that.\"[26]\n\nDuring his years studying theater, Hanks met Vincent Dowling, head of the Great Lakes Theater Festival in Cleveland, Ohio.[12] At Dowling's suggestion, Hanks became an intern at the festival. His internship stretched into a three-year experience that covered most aspects of theater production, including lighting, set design, and stage management, prompting Hanks to drop out of college. During the same time, Hanks won the Cleveland Critics Circle Award for Best Actor for his 1978 performance as Proteus in Shakespeare's The Two Gentlemen of Verona, one of the few times he played a villain.[27] Time magazine named Hanks one of the \"Top 10 College Dropouts.\"[28]\n\nCareer\n\n1979\u20131986: Early work\n\nHanks at the Academy Awards after party in March 1989\n\nIn 1979, Hanks moved to New York City, where he made his film debut in the low-budget slasher film He Knows You're Alone (1980)[12][29] and landed a starring role in the television movie Mazes and Monsters.[30] Early that year, he was cast in the lead, Callimaco, in the Riverside Shakespeare Company's production of Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli's The Mandrake, directed by Daniel Southern. The following year, Hanks landed one of the lead roles, that of character Kip Wilson, on the ABC television pilot of Bosom Buddies. He and Peter Scolari played a pair of young advertising men forced to dress as women so they could live in an inexpensive all-female hotel.[12] Hanks had previously partnered with Scolari on the 1970s game show Make Me Laugh. After landing the role, Hanks moved to Los Angeles. Bosom Buddies ran for two seasons, and, although the ratings were never strong, television critics gave the program high marks. \"The first day I saw him on the set,\" co-producer Ian Praiser told Rolling Stone, \"I thought, 'Too bad he won't be in television for long.' I knew he'd be a movie star in two years.\" However, although Praiser knew it, he was not able to convince Hanks. \"The television show had come out of nowhere,\" Hanks' best friend Tom Lizzio told Rolling Stone.\n\nBosom Buddies and a guest appearance on a 1982 episode of Happy Days (\"A Case of Revenge,\" in which he played a disgruntled former classmate of Fonzie) prompted director Ron Howard to contact Hanks. Howard was working on the film Splash (1984), a romantic comedy fantasy about a mermaid who falls in love with a human.[31][32] At first, Howard considered Hanks for the role of the main character's wisecracking brother, a role that eventually went to John Candy. Instead, Hanks landed the lead role in Splash, which went on to become a surprise box office hit, grossing more than US$69 million.[33] He also had a sizable hit with the sex comedy Bachelor Party, also in 1984.[8] In 1983\u201384, Hanks made three guest appearances on Family Ties as Elyse Keaton's alcoholic brother, Ned Donnelly.[34][35]\n\nWith Nothing in Common (1986) \u2013 a story of a young man alienated from his father (played by Jackie Gleason) \u2013 Hanks began to extend himself from comedic roles to dramatic roles. In an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Hanks commented on his experience: \"It changed my desires about working in movies. Part of it was the nature of the material, what we were trying to say. But besides that, it focused on people's relationships. The story was about a guy and his father, unlike, say, The Money Pit, where the story is really about a guy and his house.\"[36]\n\nForrest Gump (1994) Hanks on the film set of(1994)\n\n1987\u20132003: Established Star\n\nAfter a few more flops and a moderate success with the comedy Dragnet, Hanks' stature in the film industry rose. The broad success of the fantasy comedy Big (1988) established Hanks as a major Hollywood talent, both as a box office draw and within the industry as an actor.[8][12][37] For his performance in the film, Hanks earned his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor.[38] Big was followed later that year by Punchline, in which he and Sally Field co-starred as struggling comedians.\n\nHanks then suffered a run of box-office underperformers: The 'Burbs (1989), Joe Versus the Volcano (1990), and The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990).[12] In the last, he portrayed a greedy Wall Street figure who gets enmeshed in a hit-and-run accident. 1989's Turner & Hooch was Hanks' only financially successful film of the period.\n\nHanks climbed back to the top again with his portrayal of a washed-up baseball legend turned manager in A League of Their Own (1992).[12] Hanks has stated that his acting in earlier roles was not great, but that he subsequently improved. In an interview with Vanity Fair, Hanks noted his \"modern era of moviemaking ... because enough self-discovery has gone on ... My work has become less pretentiously fake and over the top\". This \"modern era\" began in 1993 for Hanks, first with Sleepless in Seattle and then with Philadelphia. The former was a blockbuster success about a widower who finds true love over the radio airwaves.[39] Richard Schickel of TIME called his performance \"charming,\" and most critics agreed that Hanks' portrayal ensured him a place among the premier romantic-comedy stars of his generation.[40]\n\nIn Philadelphia, he played a gay lawyer with AIDS who sues his firm for discrimination.[12] Hanks lost 35 pounds and thinned his hair in order to appear sickly for the role. In a review for People, Leah Rozen stated, \"Above all, credit for Philadelphia's success belongs to Hanks, who makes sure that he plays a character, not a saint. He is flat-out terrific, giving a deeply felt, carefully nuanced performance that deserves an Oscar.\" Hanks won the 1993 Academy Award for Best Actor for his role in Philadelphia.[12][41] During his acceptance speech, he revealed that his high school drama teacher Rawley Farnsworth and former classmate John Gilkerson, two people with whom he was close, were gay.[42]\n\nHanks followed Philadelphia with the 1994 hit Forrest Gump which grossed a worldwide total of over $600 million at the box office.[43] Hanks remarked: \"When I read the script for Gump, I saw it as one of those kind of grand, hopeful movies that the audience can go to and feel ... some hope for their lot and their position in life ... I got that from the movies a hundred million times when I was a kid. I still do.\" Hanks won his second Best Actor Academy Award for his role in Forrest Gump, becoming only the second actor to have accomplished the feat of winning consecutive Best Actor Oscars.[44] (Spencer Tracy was the first, winning in 1937\u201338. Hanks and Tracy were the same age at the time they received their Academy Awards: 37 for the first and 38 for the second.)[45][46]\n\nHanks' next role\u2014astronaut and commander Jim Lovell, in the 1995 film Apollo 13\u2014reunited him with Ron Howard.[12] Critics generally applauded the film and the performances of the entire cast, which included actors Kevin Bacon, Bill Paxton, Gary Sinise, Ed Harris, and Kathleen Quinlan. The movie also earned nine Academy Award nominations, winning two. Later that year, Hanks starred in Disney/Pixar's CGI-animated hit film Toy Story, as the voice of Sheriff Woody.[47]\n\nHanks made his directing debut with his 1996 film That Thing You Do! about a 1960s pop group, also playing the role of a music producer.[48][49] Hanks and producer Gary Goetzman went on to create Playtone, a record and film production company named after the record company in the film.[50][51]\n\nHanks then executive produced, co-wrote, and co-directed the HBO docudrama From the Earth to the Moon. The 12-part series chronicled the space program from its inception, through the familiar flights of Neil Armstrong and Jim Lovell, to the personal feelings surrounding the reality of moon landings. The Emmy Award-winning project was, at US$68 million, one of the most expensive ventures undertaken for television.[52][53]\n\nIn 1998, Hanks' next project was no less expensive. For Saving Private Ryan, he teamed up with Steven Spielberg to make a film about a search through war-torn France after D-Day to bring back a soldier.[54] It earned the praise and respect of the film community, critics, and the general public.[55] It was labeled one of the finest war films ever made and earned Spielberg his second Academy Award for direction, and Hanks another Best Actor nomination.[56] Later that year, Hanks re-teamed with his Sleepless in Seattle co-star Meg Ryan for You've Got Mail, a remake of 1940's The Shop Around the Corner.[8] In 1999, Hanks starred in an adaptation of the Stephen King novel The Green Mile.[57] He also returned as the voice of Woody in Toy Story 2, the sequel to Toy Story. The following year, he won a Golden Globe for Best Actor and an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of a marooned FedEx systems analyst in Robert Zemeckis's Cast Away.[58][59]\n\nIn 2001, Hanks helped direct and produce the Emmy-Award-winning HBO miniseries Band of Brothers.[60] He also appeared in the September 11 television special America: A Tribute to Heroes and the documentary Rescued From the Closet.[61] He then teamed up with American Beauty director Sam Mendes for the adaptation of Max Allan Collins's and Richard Piers Rayner's graphic novel Road to Perdition, in which he played an anti-hero role as a hitman on the run with his son. That same year, Hanks collaborated once again with director Spielberg, starring opposite Leonardo DiCaprio in the hit biographical crime drama Catch Me If You Can, based on the true story of Frank Abagnale, Jr. The same year, Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson produced the hit movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding.[62][63] In August 2007, he along with co-producers Rita Wilson and Gary Goetzman, and writer and star Nia Vardalos, initiated a legal action against the production company Gold Circle Films for their share of profits from the movie.[64][65][66] At the age of 45, Hanks became the youngest-ever recipient of the American Film Institute's Life Achievement Award on June 12, 2002.[67][68]\n\nHanks at Post-Emmys Party, September 2008\n\n2004\u2013present: Later work\n\nIn 2004, he appeared in three films: The Coen brothers' The Ladykillers, another Spielberg film, The Terminal, and The Polar Express, a family film from Zemeckis for which Hanks played multiple motion capture roles. In a USA Weekend interview, Hanks discussed how he chooses projects: \"[Since] A League of Their Own, it can't be just another movie for me. It has to get me going somehow ... There has to be some all-encompassing desire or feeling about wanting to do that particular movie. I'd like to assume that I'm willing to go down any avenue in order to do it right\". In August 2005, Hanks was voted in as vice president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[69]\n\nHanks next starred in the highly anticipated film The Da Vinci Code, based on the best-selling novel by Dan Brown. The film was released May 19, 2006, in the U.S. and grossed over US$750 million worldwide.[70] He followed the film with Ken Burns's 2007 documentary The War. For the documentary, Hanks did voice work, reading excerpts from World War II-era columns by Al McIntosh. In 2006, Hanks topped a 1,500-strong list of \"most trusted celebrities\" compiled by Forbes magazine.[71] Hanks also produced the animated children's movie The Ant Bully in 2006.\n\nHanks next appeared in a cameo role as himself in The Simpsons Movie, in which he appeared in an advertisement claiming that the U.S. government has lost its credibility and is hence buying some of his. He also made an appearance in the credits, expressing a desire to be left alone when he is out in public. Later in 2006, Hanks produced the British film Starter for Ten, a comedy based on working-class students attempting to win on University Challenge.[72]\n\nIn 2007, Hanks starred in Mike Nichols's film Charlie Wilson's War (written by screenwriter Aaron Sorkin) in which he played Democratic Texas Congressman Charles Wilson. The film opened on December 21, 2007, and Hanks received a Golden Globe nomination.[73] In the comedy-drama film The Great Buck Howard (2008), Hanks played the on-screen father of a young man (played by Hanks' real-life son, Colin) who chooses to work as road manager for a fading mentalist (John Malkovich). His character was less than thrilled about his son's career decision.[74] In the same year, he executive produced the musical comedy, Mamma Mia and the miniseries, John Adams.[75][76]\n\nHanks' next endeavor, released on May 15, 2009, was a film adaptation of Angels & Demons, based on the novel of the same name by Dan Brown. Its April 11, 2007, announcement revealed that Hanks would reprise his role as Robert Langdon, and that he would reportedly receive the highest salary ever for an actor.[77][78] The following day he made his 10th appearance on NBC's Saturday Night Live, impersonating himself for the Celebrity Jeopardy sketch. Hanks produced the Spike Jonze film Where The Wild Things Are, based on the children's book by Maurice Sendak in 2009.[79]\n\nIn 2010, Hanks reprised his voice role of Woody in Toy Story 3, after he, Tim Allen, and John Ratzenberger were invited to a movie theater to see a complete story reel of the movie.[80] The film went on to become the first animated film to gross a worldwide total of over $1 billion as well as the highest-grossing animated film at the time.[81][82][83] He also was executive producer of the miniseries, The Pacific.[84]\n\nIn 2011, he directed and starred opposite Julia Roberts in the title role in the romantic comedy Larry Crowne.[85] The movie received poor reviews, with only 35% of the 175 Rotten Tomatoes reviews giving it high ratings.[86] Also in 2011, he starred in the drama film Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close.[87] In 2012, he voiced the character Cleveland Carr for a web series he created titled Electric City.[88] He also starred in the Wachowskis-directed film adaptation of the novel of the same name, Cloud Atlas and was executive producer of the miniseries Game Change.[89]\n\nIn 2013, Hanks starred in two critically acclaimed films\u2014Captain Phillips and Saving Mr. Banks\u2014which each earned him praise, including nominations for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Drama for the former role.[90][91] In Captain Phillips, he starred as Captain Richard Phillips with Barkhad Abdi, which was based on the Maersk Alabama hijacking.[92] In Saving Mr. Banks, co-starring Emma Thompson and directed by John Lee Hancock, he played Walt Disney, being the first actor to portray Disney in a mainstream film.[93] That same year, Hanks made his Broadway debut, starring in Nora Ephron's Lucky Guy, for which he was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play.[94]\n\nIn 2014, Hanks' short story \"Alan Bean Plus Four\" was published in the October 27 issue of The New Yorker.[95] Revolving around four friends who make a voyage to the moon, the short story is titled after the Apollo 12 astronaut Alan Bean. Slate magazine's Katy Waldman found Hanks' first published short story \"mediocre\", writing that \"Hanks' shopworn ideas about technology might have yet sung if they hadn't been wrapped in too-clever lit mag-ese\".[96] In an interview with The New Yorker, Hanks said he has always been fascinated by space. He told the magazine that he built plastic models of rockets when he was a child and watched live broadcasts of space missions back in the 1960s.[97]\n\nIn March 2015, Hanks appeared in the Carly Rae Jepsen music video for \"I Really Like You\", lip-syncing most of the song's lyrics as he goes through his daily routine.[98] His next film was the Steven Spielberg-directed historical drama Bridge of Spies, in which he played lawyer James B. Donovan who negotiated for the release of pilot Francis Gary Powers by the Soviet Union in exchange for KGB spy Rudolf Abel. It was released in October 2015 to a positive reception.[99] In April 2016, Hanks starred as Alan Clay in the comedy-drama A Hologram for the King, an adaptation of the 2012 novel of the same name.[100]\n\nHanks starred as airline captain Chesley Sullenberger in Clint Eastwood's Sully, which was released in September 2016.[101] He next reprised his role as Robert Langdon in Inferno (2016),[102] and co-starred alongside Emma Watson in the 2017 science fiction drama The Circle.[103] He voiced David S.

I meditate on the 'why?' of 'why people are as they are' and 'why bad things happen to good people,' and 'why good things happen to bad people' ... The mystery is what I think is, almost, the grand unifying theory of all mankind.\"[21]\n\nOn October 7, 2013, on The Late Show with David Letterman, Hanks announced that he has Type 2 diabetes.[120]\n\nPolitics and activism\n\nHanks supports same-sex marriage, environmental causes, and alternative fuels.

Hanks and others raised over US$44 million to campaign against the proposition, in contrast to the supporters' $39 million,[124] but Proposition 8 passed with 52% of the vote.[125] It was overruled in June 2013, when the Ninth Circuit lifted its stay of the district court's ruling, enabling Governor Jerry Brown to order same-sex marriage officiations to resume.[126] While premiering a TV series in January 2009, Hanks called supporters of Proposition 8 \"un-American\" and criticized the LDS Church members, who were major proponents of the bill, for their views on marriage and role in supporting the bill.[127][128] About a week later, he apologized for the remark, saying that nothing is more American than voting one's conscience.[129]\n\nA proponent of environmentalism, Hanks is an investor in electric vehicles and owns a Toyota RAV4 EV and the first production AC Propulsion eBox. He was a lessee of an EV1 before it was recalled, as chronicled in the documentary Who Killed the Electric Car?[130] He was on the waiting list for an Aptera 2 Series.[131]\n\nHanks serves as campaign chair of the Hidden Heroes Campaign of the Elizabeth Dole Foundation.

He has frequently been referred to as \"America's Dad\".[148] In 2013, when he was starring in Nora Ephron's Lucky Guy on Broadway, he had crowds of 300 fans waiting for a glimpse of him after every performance. This is the highest number of expectant fans post-show of any Broadway performance.[149]\n\nHanks is ranked as the fourth highest all-time box office star in North America, with a total gross of over $4.5 billion at the North American box office, an average of $100.8 million per film.[3] Worldwide, his films have grossed over $9.0 billion.[150]\n\nAsteroid 12818 Tomhanks is named after him.[151]\n\nAwards\n\nHanks receiving the 2016 Presidential Medal of Freedom\n\n2006: Douglas S.

{"label": true, "txt": "This post contains spoilers for Grey\u2019s Anatomy Season 14, Episode 24, \u201cAll of Me.\u201d\n\nLove was clearly in the air in Seattle on Thursday night\u2014at least, it was in the world of Grey\u2019s Anatomy. The show\u2019s typically emotional season finale ended up celebrating three weddings, two of which belonged to characters we\u2019ve known and loved for years. Fans were already aware that Jo and Alex would be tying the knot this week, but in a surprise twist, April also wound up getting hitched to Matthew\u2014and thankfully, this time she didn\u2019t flee the wedding.\n\nIt was a sweet ending for actress Sarah Drew, who is leaving the show after nearly a decade of playing Dr. Kepner. Also on her way out? Jessica Capshaw, who has played Arizona Robbins since Season 5. Arizona got a similarly loving farewell, as she moved to New York to be closer to her daughter, Sofia, and her currently single ex-wife, Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez, who left the show in 2016). Grey\u2019s Anatomy fans know how cruel this writers\u2019 room can be, even to longtime cast members\u2014just ask Patrick Dempsey\u2014so it was a relief to see both April and Arizona make it out unscathed, even if April in particular has had a rough season.\n\nWhen news first broke that both Drew and Capshaw would be saying goodbye to the series\u2014apparently not by choice\u2014one report speculated that their write-offs could have something to do with co-star Ellen Pompeo\u2019s $20 million salary, a notion the actress quickly denied. Either way, the goodbyes were always going to be tough. Both actresses were given boxes filled with letters from the cast and crew on their last day of filming\u2014a well-earned token to two actresses who have been with the show for so many years.\n\nAfter a day of traumatic losses earlier this season, April struggled with a severe loss of faith\u2014a devastating turn for the longtime devout Christian. Toward the season\u2019s latter half, however, things started to turn around. April reconnected with her ex-fianc\u00e9, Matthew, whom she left at the altar to be with Jackson in Season 10. (Matthew had since re-married, but lost his wife during the birth of their baby, Ruby, who survived.) Soon enough, things once again took a dark turn, as they are wont to do on this hospital drama: April nearly died in a car accident\u2014an experience that led her to quit her job as a trauma surgeon at Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital to instead, as we learned this week, work with homeless communities.\n\nThankfully, as April\u2019s story wrapped up, the Grey\u2019s writers decided to send Drew off on a high note: after Alex and Jo\u2019s wedding ceremony fell apart, Matthew spontaneously proposed to April. The minister, who had gotten lost on her way to the venue, arrived just in time to marry the happy couple\u2014with Arizona, Jackson, and Sofia serving as witnesses. (Don\u2019t worry: Jo and Alex still had a ceremony of their own, with a newly ordained Meredith officiating on the Seattle ferry, the maritime mascot of this series.) It seems a little implausible that Matthew would want the man April previously left him for standing right there at his wedding, but given that Jackson is the father of April\u2019s own child, Harriet, perhaps there\u2019s no time like the present to practice some blended-family bonding.\n\nAnd speaking of Arizona . . .\n\nIt looks like things might be looking up in the romance department for Capshaw\u2019s character as well\u2014although her reconciliation with her ex-wife will have to take place off-screen. Callie and Arizona broke up years ago, following a heartbreaking struggle to stay together after Arizona cheated on Callie with a visiting doctor. Eventually, Callie moved to New York to be with her new girlfriend, Penny, who got a job at a hospital there\u2014taking her and Arizona\u2019s daughter, Sofia, with her. Now, however, she and Arizona are both single\u2014and as Arizona revealed to April and Richard at the wedding, she smiles every time she and Callie talk. As Arizona and Sofia fly off to New York, fans who never accepted the Arizona-Callie breakup can rest easy, filling in the blanks for themselves and imagining a well-deserved happy ending for both.\n\nGrey\u2019s Anatomy has killed off plenty of deeply loved characters in creative and excruciating ways, including George O\u2019Malley, Lexie Grey, Mark Sloan, and Derek Shepherd. But in its most recent seasons, the series has been more reluctant to kill off members of its cast\u2014as evidenced by the gentle write-off given to Jerrika Hinton\u2019s character, Stephanie Edwards, in the Season 13 finale. Though she almost died, in the end, Edwards found her direction in life and realized she didn\u2019t want to be a doctor anymore. She left Grey Sloan to explore what her life could be like outside a hospital. April and Arizona\u2019s departures also suggest that the series is backing away from gruesome, heartrending deaths in favor of kinder farewells\u2014at least for now. Then again, that will only make the next big death all the more shocking.\n\nGet Vanity Fair\u2019s HWD Newsletter Sign up for essential industry and award news from Hollywood.

Still, on her first day working alongside friend Mariska Hargitay on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit, \u201cI was so nervous to come into this well-oiled machine that I called her my character\u2019s name,\u201d Shields said, laughing.\n\nShe\u2019s referring to the scene that ended this week\u2019s episode of the NBC procedural: Olivia, who at the top of the episode was relieved to hear that her child-abuse investigation had been closed, answers a knock at her apartment door to find Shields standing on the other side. \u201cOlivia Benson?\u201d the woman says, \u201cI\u2019m Sheila Porter, Noah\u2019s grandmother.\u201d\n\nFans of the series know this is not great for Lt.

And as Liv reminded Trevor Langan in Wednesday\u2019s hour, Ellie had told Olivia that both of her parents were dead.\n\nTurns out, Ellie lied. And now that Sheila is making moves to vacate Noah\u2019s adoption, expect to see a lot more of Shields\u2019 character in the coming weeks.\n\nShields told reporters at a recent press event that she\u2019s very aware of how Olivia\u2019s enemies are viewed by SVU diehards. \u201cBut I think what fans will understand is that both of these woman actually have a valid argument, and what does that mean? It is about winning? Is it about finding the healthiest compromise?\u201d she asked. \u201cI\u2019m not there to replace [Olivia]. I\u2019m not there to undermine or stamp her out, so I\u2019m not an adversary in that way.\u201d\n\nNew showrunner Michael Chernuchin credits Hargitay with thinking of Shields for the part, an idea that came up after Hargitay saw Shields act in an episode of mutual pal Ali Wentworth\u2019s Pop comedy Nightcap.\n\n\u201cI sit at the screening, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh my god, she\u2019s perfect!\u201d Hargitay recalls.

{"label": true, "txt": "A birthday date isn't done right unless it involves a private helicopter... said anyone who's ever been on The Bachelor. Wells Adams took girlfriend Sarah Hyland on a helicopter ride for her 27th birthday celebration and it's a cuteness overload fans can't handle. Since competing for JoJo Fletcher's heart on Season 11 of The Bachelorette and appearing on Bachelor in Paradise, the radio host has clearly been trained well (no pun intended) when it comes to impressing the ladies. Basically, Wells Adams is The Bachelor personified.\n\nOn Friday, the reality TV star posted a photo of himself with his Modern Family girlfriend in front of a helicopter (which they took to Catalina, an island off of LA). As if the photo wasn't extravagant enough, the caption is what will really put their shippers over the edge:\n\n\"Top 5 ways helicopters are like Sarah: 1. They make you feel like you're floating. 2. Every moment with them is an adventure. 3. They make you feel like you're falling, in the best way.4. They defy gravity. 5. They are really fucking coolHappy birthday @sarahhyland. You're my favorite thing. Everyday should feel this good. Thanks @vineyardvines for helping out with this amazing date!\"\n\nOne fan wrote, \"Why is he so perfect,\" and another commented, \"No way this is real life.\" Instagram is definitely here for this couple. And until now, their romance has seemed pretty relatable, but The Bachelor in Adams had to come out sooner or later.\n\nSince publicly celebrating their romance over the last few weeks, all eyes have been on Hyland and Adams' every move. Seriously, people were stoked that the couple happened to be wearing \"matching\" plaid button-downs during the plane date (which weren't really matching, for the record).\n\nAnd in Hollywood, are celebrities really dating if they don't go to a professional basketball game together to be truly seen? It's not likely. Which is why these two took their love court side to watch a LA Lakers game together a few days before Hyland's birthday. The date led to this photo, which Adams is very proud exists:\n\nA lot of their fans can catch the action on Hyland's Instagram story, where she likes to frequently post behind-the-scene snippets of their time together. Plus, there was that one time Hyland live-streamed one of their dates, when they shopped, played around, and cuddled up next to a fireplace watching TV with Adams' dog.\n\nWhile most fans seem to approve of the new couple, there are obviously some trolls out there who will have their say. On Nov. 13, the actor posted a photo of herself and Adams lying shirtless in bed with his dog and the caption: \"Two more reasons to smile again.\" After getting backlash on the internet telling her to \"keep [her] sexual life private,\" Hyland took to Twitter to defend herself in a lengthy explanation consisting of multiple screenshots. \"I do want my privacy... This time is different,\" she wrote. \"It\u2019s special. And I will share what I [deem] \u2018appropriate\u2019 on social media because I still want you all to be updated.\"\n\nAfter fans speculated their romance (since they had coordinating Stranger Things Halloween costumes), the two made it Instagram official with respective posts on Nov. 5. Adams posted a photo of the two kissing and Hyland posted one of them goofing around with the caption: \"He puts up with me.\" Within the next few days, Adams was watching Hyland perform and Hyland wore a \"W\" necklace.\n\nAlthough the romance seems to be yet another product of Hollywood matchmaking, Hyland and Adams were apparently fans of each other long before they met. In July 2016, Hyland shamelessly tweeted about Adams and how attractive she found him when he was on The Bachelorette. In August, 2017, Adams tweeted at Hyland, flirtatiously asking her to give him a hand as bartender on BiP. It's unclear how they ultimately ended up meeting, but does it really matter at this point? Hopefully Adams will contonue giving the crowd what it wants: more Bachelor-style dates, pronto."}

{"label": true, "txt": "The ABC reality star and fiancee Lauren Burnham plan to marry in January \u2014 but ABC viewers aren't invited.\n\nOne day after his ex-fiancee announced that she is now engaged, former Bachelor Arie Luyendyk Jr. revealed that he and Lauren Burnham have set a wedding date.\n\n\"We're getting married in Hawaii on Jan. 12 next year,\" Burnham, with Luyendyk by her side, announced on The View Wednesday. \"If we were able to get married tomorrow, we would. We're just ready for that next step.\"\n\nThe pair \u2014 who just bought a new house in Scottsdale, Ariz., where Luyendyk, a race car driver and real estate broker, is based \u2014 have booked Maui's Haiku Mill for the nontelevised event. \"It's a private wedding, so not on TV,\" he confirmed. \"Just a close group of friends, probably 100 guests.\"\n\nAs ABC's most-recent Bachelor, Luyendyk became one of the most controversial stars of the long-running franchise when he swapped his final pick. After he proposed to an accepting Becca Kufrin on the pretaped March 5 episode, it was revealed on the post-finale After the Final Rose special that Luyendyk had changed his mind.\n\nAfter a two-month engagement, Luyendyk called off his relationship with Kufrin during a difficult-to-watch on-camera breakup that played out unedited and ran for nearly an hour. He then turned around and proposed a second time on live television to Burnham, who accepted.\n\n\"Going back to that time, it was a big risk to do what I did and I know that it wasn't a popular decision,\" Luyendyk explained, \"but it was a decision I had to make for myself. At the end of the day, it's a TV show but this is the rest of our lives, and Lauren was the person I was supposed to be with.\"\n\nThe choices made by Luyendyk and producers to ambush Kufrin, and by ABC to air the breakup footage, sent backlash Luyendyk's way and turned off some fans of the franchise. Think pieces and takedowns ran in the week that followed and as Kufrin accepted her new role as the next star of The Bachelorette, Luyendyk and Burnham largely disappeared from the spotlight, choosing to keep viewers updated on their relationship via their social media channels.\n\nOn Wednesday, the pair said neither of them has watched the finale to this day.\n\n\"They say it was unedited but it was edited,\" said Luyendyk. \"[As the Bachelor,] you are not in the editing room and you can't really control what they show.\"\n\nHe added, \"Going into it, the biggest reason why I wanted it to be filmed was so that everyone could see the story. Not only the good things but also the bad things. Just because [with] the finale, there's always a lot of questions. When [former Bachelor] Jason Mesnick changed his mind \u2014 he's happy and has kids and a great life \u2014 they didn't film anything and fans were upset by that. I really wanted everyone to see our love story and I think the editing chose to show more of the breakup than the happy parts of that ending.\"\n\nBurnham admitted that she knew Luyendyk was going to break up with Kufrin, but that filming the heartbreaks are part of what they signed up for.\n\n\"I knew he was going to break up with Becca and I knew that production was involved, so I kind of figured that's what was happening,\" she said. \"But the whole thing was taped. My breakup was taped and everyone else's was, that's kind of the name of the game.\"\n\nUnlike a handful of successful Bachelor couples to come before them, Luyendyk and Burnham are opting to not invite ABC's cameras to their big day. The Bachelor franchise has aired five TV weddings, including original Bachelorette Trista and Ryan Sutter's and former Bachelor Sean and Catherine Lowe's.\n\nWhen speaking to The Hollywood Reporter after the finale in March, the couple had said they hoped to set a date later in the year. At the time, they both said they were open to the idea of a TV wedding, but Luyendyk had added, \"I think it\u2019s more about if it works in our timeline.\"\n\nLuyendyk's and Burnham's live TV appearance \u2014 their first since a whirlwind post-finale press week \u2014 comes days before Kufrin begins her Bachelorette journey Monday.\n\nWhen asked about the curious timing, Burnham replied with a laugh, \"Honestly, I don't think we really had much control over that.\" Luyendyk added, \"Our plan just came together so it just happens to be the timing of things. We're excited to do it privately because everyone asks us, so we were like: Why not just come on here and tell everybody?\"\n\nThough Burnham played coy about whether or not she has spoken to Kufrin or if they will appear on the upcoming season, Luyendyk had a solid answer when asked if he would do anything differently: \"It's hard to live in regret. Because of how things ended, I think our relationship is stronger and I wouldn't change it.\"\n\nViewers have been particularly invested in Kufrin's happily ever after ever since she was subjected to the on-camera breakup, and on Tuesday, she revealed that she does in fact find love at the end of her journey, which wrapped filming weeks ago.\n\n\"I'm engaged!\" she told People. \"I still pinch myself, like, did that all just happen? It\u2019s been a whirlwind.\"\n\nAdding, \"It feels so good to say it and this time, I think it's going to stick!\"\n\nShe also said that now, having been in Luyendyk's shoes as the lead of the reality dating show, she does sympathize with his decision-making.\n\n\"Looking back, as weird as it sounds, I can really only thank [Arie] because he followed his heart and it allowed me to go on this new journey for myself to find the person who is a better suit, better fit for me,\" she said. \"He's just a special one.\"\n\nTwenty-eight men compete for Kufrin's final rose when The Bachelorette premieres Monday, May 28, at 8 p.m. on ABC."}

GIPHY is how you search, share, discover, and create GIFs.\n\nLittlefinger finally had his come-uppance in the Game of Thrones season 7 finale, ambushed by a united front of Starks: it was revealed that Arya, Sansa and Bran had been talking to each other and all of them knew what was going on. Littlefinger, meanwhile, did not. He was standing calmly in Winterfell\u2019s great hall, believing he was about to watch the execution of Arya Stark \u2013 something he\u2019d been wheedling Sansa into for several episodes \u2013 when Sansa suddenly turned the tables on him and revealed that she\u2019d been playing him all along.\n\nFans are, of course, happy about the demise of the dastardly Lord Baelish \u2013 but they\u2019re also confused about how the narrative of the Winterfell subplot stitches together across the episodes of season 7. In a much-upvoted post, Redditor DarkSun09 wrote: \u201cI guess the Stark girls were just acting like they had turned against one another in order to fool Littlefinger. What I don\u2019t understand is why. Why did they have to fool Littlefinger in the first place? What purpose did that serve? They had Bran and, presumably, all the evidence they needed against Littlefinger already, so why not just drag him out, expose his crimes, and execute him? Why did they have to do all that acting in front of him?\n\n\u201cIn the end,\u201d they continue, \u201call they did was accuse him of a bunch of stuff, which he simply denies. Then they just killed him anyway without actually producing any evidence to prove him wrong. I don\u2019t get the point of any of this. Someone please explain.\u201d\n\nAnother Redditor replied that the showrunners \u201csay they were solely focused on making the viewer believe the Starks would turn on each other before twisting it at the end. It doesn\u2019t seem like they were concerned with in-character explanations, they were just concerned with selling the viewer on the fake-out. That\u2019s why the plot seems weird and difficult to parse, because there isn\u2019t really an in-universe explanation.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of opposition to this storyline \u2013 but there is some sense in it. Let\u2019s go through the scenes one by one to try and sort it out:\n\nArya returns home (Episode 4)\n\nWhat it tells us: The \u2018hard feelings\u2019 Arya and Sansa display towards one another in episodes 5 and 6 can only be a ruse.\n\nWhen Arya returns to Winterfell in episode 4 \u2013 before she even realises that Littlefinger is there too \u2013 she heads down to the crypts to find the tomb of her father, Ned. Sansa comes to find her there, and they\u2019re completely alone. Arya tells Sansa that being lady of Winterfell \u201csuits you\u201d. When Arya asks if Sansa killed Joffrey says she \u201cwishes\u201d she had, proving to Arya straight away that she hated her former fianc\u00e9. There is a lot of affection in this interaction, and no mistrust: unlike the staged argument they have a couple of episodes later, there\u2019s no beef here about how Sansa \u201cdid nothing\u201d when Ned was executed, and in this scene they\u2019re literally standing in front of a statue of their dead father.\n\nArya berates Sansa (Episode 5)\n\nWhat it tells us: Arya is faking it \u2013 she told Sansa in episode 4 that being Lady of Winterfell \u201csuits\u201d her.\n\nArya comes to Sansa\u2019s room and loudly tells Sansa off for moving herself into their parents\u2019 room, for having \u2018nice things\u2019 and for aspiring to hold the power that Jon has. In hindsight, we can view this as the point where Arya and Sansa begin acting out a disagreement to see what Littlefinger does \u2013 because they know he\u2019s spying on them. By faking it, they\u2019re able to make him play his hand and cause him to incriminate himself irreversibly.\n\nArya steals from Littlefinger (Episode 5)\n\nWhat it tells us: Arya lets Littlefinger see her steal the note because she wants him to think she is planning to take down Sansa.\n\nIt\u2019s only after Arya and Sansa\u2019s first staged argument that Littlefinger asks Winterfell\u2019s Maester to find the incriminating message Sansa sent to Robb, where she asked him to bend the knee to her evil fianc\u00e9 Joffrey Baratheon, after her father was accused of treason and awaiting execution by the Lannisters. By taking the \u2018bait\u2019 of this message, Arya is tricking Littlefinger into thinking she wants leverage with which to take down Sansa.\n\nArya and Sansa argue again (Episode 6)\n\nWhat it tells us: The staged fight continues.\n\nOut on the balcony of Winterfell\u2019s courtyard, Arya and Sansa have another, even more public staged argument, where Arya reads out the note Littlefinger wanted Arya to find. It says:\n\n\u201cRobb, I write to you today with heavy heart. Our good King Robert is dead. Killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt. Father has been charged with treason. He conspired with Robert\u2019s brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne. The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort. I beg you, come to King\u2019s Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark. Your faithful sister, Sansa.\u201d\n\nArya then says: I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.\u201d\n\nSansa then pretends to get uppity, boasting about her contribution in the Battle of Bastards: \u201cYou didn\u2019t win [Winterfell] back, Jon didn\u2019t win it back, he lost the Battle of the Bastards. The Knights of the Vale have won the battle and they rode north for me.\u201d Arya then takes the argument a step further by threatening to show the message to the Northern Lords.\n\nLittlefinger tries to pit Sansa against Arya with Brienne (Episode 6)\n\nWhat it tells us: Littlefinger is beginning to show his hand: he wants Arya dead, because she poses a danger to his \u2018control\u2019 over Sansa.\n\nAt this news, Littlefinger makes his first real error: he suggests Sansa use Brienne as a bodyguard in case Arya tries anything. It becomes clear he wants Arya dead, because she is only a threat to him. Either Arya will kill him, or she will kill Sansa \u2013 thereby removing what he sees as his \u2018control\u2019 over the north.\n\nIn order to destabilise Littlefinger further, Sansa ignores his advice, sending Brienne away to King\u2019s Landing. Littlefinger is later forced to suggest more explicitly that Sansa get rid of Arya, which proves to Sansa that he\u2019s no use to her any more.\n\nArya proves her loyalty by giving Sansa her dagger (Episode 6)\n\nWhat it tells us: The sisters are plotting together \u2013 what they\u2019re saying aloud doesn\u2019t mean anything.\n\nWhen Sansa enters Arya\u2019s room at the end of this episode and discovers her bag full of faces, Arya makes a speech that appears to threaten her, before handing her the dagger. Redditor summyg writes \u201cWe have no indication of what her handing the dagger meant other than \u2018maybe it meant something.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt seems that what the showrunners were really trying to show us here is that Arya and Sansa have been in cahoots the whole time. Their conversations sound terrible to the casual listener \u2013 like a spy at the door, for instance \u2013 but really they\u2019re just acting.\n\nLittlefinger again hints at getting rid of Arya (Episode 7)\n\nWhat it tells us: Littlefinger is sure Sansa wants to kill Arya.\n\nLittlefinger says to Sansa: \u201cAfter [Arya] murders you, what does she become? Lady of Winterfell.\u201d Like us, Sansa knows Arya has never wanted to be a lady, but Littlefinger thinks this is the way to coax Sansa into killing Arya.\n\nIt\u2019s at this point that Littlefinger has used up all his chances: Sansa knows he is only trying to sow more chaos, and will only ever continue to do so. This is when she decides he is no longer an asset, and gets rid of him with the piles of evidence she, Bran and Arya have on him.\n\nThe big twist (Episode 7)\n\nWhat it tells us: Sansa and Arya were working together the entire time \u2013 with Bran\u2019s help.\n\nThis is where the decision only to show us scenes of disagreement between Sansa and Arya comes to fruition. Surprise! Littlefinger\u2019s been busted \u2013 he\u2019s done himself out of a job by trying to pit the Starks against each other. Not only have Arya and Sansa been working to take him down, but they\u2019ve also had Bran to help. Littlefinger\u2019s tricks don\u2019t work on the Starks, and he\u2019s reduced to begging for mercy. He gets none.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the worst reason you have for turning me against my sister?\u201d Sansa asks aloud. \u201cThat\u2019s what you do, isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s what you\u2019ve always done turn family against family, turn sister against sister. That\u2019s what you did to our mother and Aunt Lysa, and that\u2019s what you tried to do to us.\u201d He pleads to the contrary, but he knows it\u2019s true. He\u2019s been played \u2013 just like most of Game of Thrones\u2018 viewership.\n\nWhat do you reckon? Were you confused by the Winterfell storyline? Does it make more sense now? Let us know what you think in the comments."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Katy Perry may be the most followed person on Twitter, but she\u2019s not the most talked about.\n\nThat honor goes to K-pop band BTS, which Twitter revealed was not only the most tweeted-about artist in the U.S. in 2017, but the most tweeted-about celebrity on the planet this year. So who are the social-media all-stars, who can amass nearly 400,000 retweetsfor a mere 13-second clip of a band member sleeping? We explore the phenomenon behind the breakout group.\n\nWHO THEY ARE: BTS is a South Korean boy band consisting of seven members ages 20 to 25, whose stage names are RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, V, Jimin and Jungkook. After a series of lineup switches by management Big Hit Entertainment, the current iteration of the band was formed in 2013, when they released their first album, 2 Cool 4 Skool. Although their Korean name, \u201cBangtan Sonyeondan,\u201d literally translates in English to \u201cBulletproof Boy Scouts,\u201d they announced this summer that they were changing it to \u201cBeyond the Scene,\u201d as part of a shift to a more progressive, mature brand identity.\n\nWHERE YOU\u2019VE HEARD THEM: In September, BTS became the first K-pop act in history to hit the top 10 of the Billboard 200 album chart, where their fifth EP, Love Yourself: Her, debuted at No. 7 with 31,000 equivalent album units, according to Nielsen Music. Their popularity continued to surge this fall, with candy-coated single DNA peaking at No. 67 on the Hot 100 singles chart in October, and performances of the EDM-tinged track on the American Music Awards and The Ellen DeGeneres Show last month. They\u2019ve also collaborated with U.S. artists including The Chainsmokers (Best of Me), Steve Aoki and Desiigner (Mic Drop, whose remix debuted at No. 28 on the Hot 100 this month).\n\nWHY THEY\u2019RE HUGE: The BTS ARMY, as they call themselves, is one of the mightiest fandoms in music right now, with factions in America and abroad running countless fan pages online, and snapping up tickets to their completely sold out world tour this year.\n\nBut why have they inspired such a feverish devotion? For starters, they\u2019re filling a void left by another cobbled-together band of international heartthrobs, the U.K.\u2019s One Direction, who split up in 2015 to pursue successful solo careers. Their good looks, goofy interviews and unguarded, relatable posts on their personal social media accounts are all fawned over incessantly, with each of the guys averaging roughly 2.5 million Instagram followers or more (with more than 20 million fans across their band\u2019s official Twitter, Instagram and Facebook pages).\n\nAnd while their fan base does skew heavily toward young women \u2014 many of whom connect with other fans globally through the ARMY Amino app, and have lists of chants rehearsed for every concert \u2014 the band\u2019s fusion of other genres such as rap and Moombahton into their music has helped broaden their appeal. Online music service Melon, for instance, found that male users in their 20s and 30s tended to listen to recent single Blood, Sweat and Tears more than female fans.\n\nPerhaps most crucially, they stand out from other K-pop bands because of their empowering messages for young people who feel like they\u2019re outcasts and underdogs. Songs like Whalien 52 and The Last address mental illness and depression head on, while others such as Spine Breaker and Change featuring Wale take on consumerism, racism and politics.\n\n\u201cThey go a lot deeper than a lot of K-pop music,\u201d says Jeff Benjamin, who writes about K-pop for Billboard. \u201cI think that\u2019s one of the main reasons BTS has been able to break out as big as (they have). They really try to make music that\u2019s socially conscious.\u201d\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT: Guesting on On Air with Ryan Seacrest, BTS teased the possibility of releasing English-language versions of their hit songs."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Mr. Weinstein was fired Sunday night from his production company, the Weinstein Company, which issued a statement saying the decision was made \u201cin light of new information about misconduct by Harvey Weinstein that has emerged in the past few days.\u201d In its report, The Times found that Mr. Weinstein had reached at least eight settlements with women who had claimed sexual harassment.\n\nIn her statement, Ms. Streep also said Mr. Weinstein had been \u201crespectful\u201d during their working relationship, and challenged the widely repeated narrative that his misbehavior had been a longtime open secret in Hollywood.\n\nHere is Ms. Streep\u2019s full statement:\n\nThe disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed, and those whose good and worthy causes he supported. The intrepid women who raised their voices to expose this abuse are our heroes. One thing can be clarified. Not everybody knew. Harvey supported the work fiercely, was exasperating but respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally. I didn\u2019t know about these other offenses: I did not know about his financial settlements with actresses and colleagues; I did not know about his having meetings in his hotel room, his bathroom, or other inappropriate, coercive acts. And if everybody knew, I don\u2019t believe that all the investigative reporters in the entertainment and the hard news media would have neglected for decades to write about it. The behavior is inexcusable, but the abuse of power familiar. Each brave voice that is raised, heard and credited by our watchdog media will ultimately change the game.\n\nGlenn Close: \u2018I\u2019m Angry\u2019\n\nIn a statement to The Times, Ms. Close said that she felt \u201cangry and darkly sad,\u201d and that while Mr. Weinstein had been decent with her, she had heard rumors of inappropriate behavior toward women over many years.\n\nHer full statement:\n\nI\u2019m sitting here, deeply upset, acknowledging to myself that, yes, for many years, I have been aware of the vague rumors that Harvey Weinstein had a pattern of behaving inappropriately around women. Harvey has always been decent to me, but now that the rumors are being substantiated, I feel angry and darkly sad. I\u2019m angry, not just at him and the conspiracy of silence around his actions, but also that the \u201ccasting couch\u201d phenomenon, so to speak, is still a reality in our business and in the world: the horrible pressure, the awful expectation put on a woman when a powerful, egotistical, entitled bully expects sexual favors in exchange for a job. Ours is an industry in which very few actors are indispensable and women are cast in far fewer roles than men, so the stakes are higher for women and make them more vulnerable to the manipulations of a predator. I applaud the monumental courage of the women who have spoken up. I hope that their stories and the reportage that gave them their voices represents a tipping point, that more stories will be told and that change will follow. The changes must be both institutional and personal. Men and women, in positions of power, must create a work environment in which people, whose jobs depend on them, feel safe to report threatening and inappropriate behavior, like that reported in the Times. No one should be coerced into trading personal dignity for professional success. I feel the time is long and tragically overdue for all of us in the industry, women and men, to unite \u2014 calmly and dispassionately \u2014 and create a new culture of respect, equality and empowerment, where bullies and their enablers are no longer allowed to prosper.\n\nKate Winslet: \u2018Disgraceful and Appalling\u2019\n\nIn a statement to Variety, Ms. Winslet said that Mr. Weinstein\u2019s \u201cbehaviour is without question disgraceful and appalling and very, very wrong. I had hoped that these kind of stories were just made up rumours, maybe we have all been na\u00efve. And it makes me so angry. There must be \u2018no tolerance\u2019 of this degrading, vile treatment of women in any workplace anywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nMs. Winslet won a best actress Oscar in 2008 for her role in \u201cThe Reader,\u201d which was released by the Weinstein Company."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Louise Linton, wife of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, made headlines after posing with Mnuchin in front of a sheet of new $1 bills Nov. 15. This wasn't the first time she caused controversy. (Elyse Samuels/The Washington Post)\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\u2019s wife, Louise Linton, boasted of flying on a government plane with her husband to Kentucky on Monday and then named the numerous fashion brands she wore on the trip in an unusual social media post that only became more bizarre minutes later.\n\nWhen someone posted a comment on Linton's Instagram picture that criticized the way Linton touted the trip, the treasury secretary's wife swung back hard, mentioning the extreme wealth she and her husband control.\n\n\u201cDid you think this was a personal trip?!\u201d Linton wrote on her Instagram page, responding to the person who had written \u201cglad we could pay for your little getaway.\u201d\n\n(Linton's Instagram account was later made \u201cprivate\u201d so that it could not be publicly seen).\n\nLouise Linton, wife of US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, just turned her Instagram private after posting this (h/t @skenigsberg) pic.twitter.com/beakVnAhhu \u2014 Margarita Noriega (@margarita) August 22, 2017\n\nLinton continued in her response to the critic: \u201cAdorable! Do you think the US govt paid for our honeymoon or personal travel?! Lololol. Have you given more to the economy than me and my husband? Either as an individual earner in taxes OR in self sacrifice to your country? I\u2019m pretty sure we paid more taxes toward our day \u2018trip\u2019 than you did. Pretty sure the amount we sacrifice per year is a lot more than you\u2019d be willing to sacrifice if the choice was yours.\u201d\n\nLinton added, \u201cYou\u2019re adorably out of touch \u2026 Thanks for the passive aggressive nasty comment. Your kids look very cute. Your life looks cute.\u201d\n\nThis ignited a raft of controversy and drew national media attention for Linton. The spouses of cabinet members are often shielded from public scrutiny, but they also tend to keep a low profile. The spouses of recent Treasury chiefs rarely traveled on official business with their husbands, and there is little precedent for a social media fight like this.\n\nLinton's Instagram episode came in the midst of a strange period for Mnuchin, who two days earlier sent a letter to his former Yale University classmates explaining why he would not resign from office. His former classmates at Yale had called on Mnuchin to step down because of comments President Trump made following a killing in Charlottesville, Va. at the scene of a violent rally held by white supremacists and Neo-Nazis. Trump's comments after the rally expressed some sympathy for some of the people marching with the white supremacists.\n\nIn the statement Mnuchin issued one week after the Charlottesville death, he said he condemns \"the actions of those filled with hate and with the intent to harm others.\" Mnuchin's statement stood out in part because other members of Trump's cabinet issued statements condemning the white supremacists almost immediately after the violence.\n\nMnuchin is playing a central role in the White House's effort to overhaul the tax code and raise the debt ceiling, and the recent distractions have the potential to overshadow his work in those areas.\n\nThe fashion companies Linton \u201ctagged\u201d in her Instagram post were Herm\u00e8s, Roland Mouret, Tom Ford and Valentino.\n\nMnuchin and Linton have been married for two months. Mnuchin is a Hollywood producer and former banker.\n\nThe bizarre exchange came the day Mnuchin flew to Louisville to try to make the case for Congress to overhaul the tax code. He particularly stressed how the tax changes would help middle-class Americans, although Democrats have alleged the Trump administration wants to pass large tax cuts that benefit the wealthy and multinational corporations.\n\nTypically, Treasury secretaries only fly government planes when they go on international trips.

{"label": true, "txt": "On June 4, 2017, a sexual encounter occurred on the set of Bachelor in Paradise in Sayulita, Mexico, between two castmembers who had been drinking. One or both parties may have been too intoxicated to give consent. One week later, on June 11, production company Warner Bros. Television announced that it had suspended shooting of ABC's Bachelor spinoff. Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson came forward on June 14 as the individuals at the center of the investigation, releasing separate public statements and vowing to take legal action.\n\nWith a possible cancellation of Bachelor in Paradise looming, season-three alum Evan Bass defends the series on which he fell in love.\n\nBass, 34, and Carly Waddell, 31, met and got engaged during the summer of 2016. Bass had recently been introduced on Joelle \"JoJo\" Fletcher's season of The Bachelorette. On the show, Bass was portrayed as a quirky \"erectile dysfunction specialist\" and loving father of three boys in Nashville, Tennessee. Fans first met Waddell, a Nashville singer-songwriter, on Chris Soules' season of The Bachelor and the previous season of Bachelor in Paradise. The couple was set to return to the island paradise during this season for a televised wedding, back where their love story first began and will still be tying the knot on Saturday, sources tell The Hollywood Reporter, for the cameras and a select guest list despite the ongoing investigation.\n\nBelow, Bass begs ABC not to cancel the series, describes the protocol for alcohol on set and explains the way he believes consent is and should be dealt with on and off the reality show.\n\nBachelor in Paradise is my show. It's my jam. Personal redemption, lifelong friends and the woman of my dreams are just a few of the many takeaways I found living on set for weeks at the air-condition-less resort. When the news about Paradise production broke the internet, it also broke my heart. While to some it's a silly TV show, for me, it was an experience that changed my life in unimaginable ways. I am troubled thinking about the allegations happening on my favorite beach, and I'm sad that some couples will not have the opportunity to find love in a powerful and unique way. I can't help but think about [season-one couple] Jade and Tanner [Tolbert], the fast-approaching birth of their baby and how that beautiful family wouldn't exist without Paradise. And for me, I will be forever grateful to Paradise for guiding me to an incredible stepmother to my own children.\n\nFamily creation aside, I'm equally disturbed by the way the production of the show is being portrayed. At first I wanted to stay quiet and let the dust settle before speaking out, but as the show has come under more sensationalized hostility and more unnamed \"sources\" speak out, I feel compelled to share my experiences with the show and its production team. Between Carly and me, we've appeared on five Bachelor-themed series, including appearances on the entire seasons of BIP two and three. So we know how this show works, why it works, and I'm going to tell you why ABC should keep the show.\n\nI'm not here to pontificate about rumors or conjecture, and we must absolutely allow time for the truth to come out. In this day and age, people are happy to consume rumors and then regurgitate them in toxic judgment, but the truth has a way of weaseling its way to the surface. I'm anxiously hopeful that the full story is given the light of day before misinformation does any more damage. I've talked with several castmembers who were on-site, and from their perspectives, this was not anywhere close to what's being portrayed in the media. The overwhelming theme from the cast is that although these allegations should be taken seriously, the actual events have been blown way out of proportion and that \"consent\" was not an issue that day or in the days following. Their anger is not so much directed at Corinne but more at the rogue \"newbie\" producers who manufactured something out of nothing. Now that Corinne has lawyered up, she's following the natural path of a scandal by protecting herself, as she has every right to do.\n\nSince I wasn't involved and have no firsthand knowledge of the situation, I want to share my Paradise experience. When I first got the call to do Paradise, I was extremely nervous about joining the cast because of how terribly I came across on JoJo's season of The Bachelorette. I felt kind of stupid about my behavior, and most of Bachelor Nation thought I was strange, to put it mildly. I avoided Twitter because I was constantly being trolled, and it honestly hurt a bunch. But I decided that if there was a chance I could find redemption, and maybe even love, that it was worth it. My heart was so ready to find a partner.\n\nAs someone who got a bad \"edit\" on The Bachelorette, it drives me nuts when news hits and former Bachelor contestants come out of the woodwork to cry about their bad edit or how terribly they were treated. Usually, it's the ones who didn't get the acclaim or followers they felt they deserved. But in all reality, we are at least cognizant of the fact that we may not look great. Most of us falsely assume we are going to come across on the screen looking like champions and don't see ourselves as \"villains,\" so how could they make us look like that? But, for example, on JoJo's season, I kept finding myself in situations where I would look silly and do abnormal things. But I did those things. I decided to give JoJo an ultimatum and then take it back five minutes later. I decided to make Chad [Johnson] my archnemesis. Doing the show, for me, with no filter, opened myself to the Twitter jeering and pain that most desperately try to avoid. After not being my best self on The Bachelorette, I took time to reflect and learn from those mistakes, but I ended up looking \"bad\" because of decisions I made and faulty internal beliefs I chose to rely on about others and myself. I realized I was broken in places and had blind spots in others.\n\nUltimately, after licking my wounds, reflecting and getting support from my friends, I found a clear headspace on Paradise where I was able to (after some ambulance theatrics) win the heart of a beautiful, smart and wildly amazing woman. The experience also created a new layer of strength and emotional armor that has been invaluable. The Twitter trolls bother me less, and my relationships are richer because of the cumulative experiences. Most importantly, it made me a better dad. Parents, especially moms, are assailed for leaving their children to go on a reality show, but the journey is powerfully transformational for all the parents I know. We become better parents and cherish the time with our children to a degree that perhaps wasn't possible without taking the time to work on us. The castmembers who get the most out of the experience are the ones who treat it as therapy. The dramatic and epic stuff is the large majority of what is televised, but some of the most valuable moments are the hours of talking that will never be shown. Generally speaking, the contestants who gripe are the ones who can't/won't internalize their experience. It's always easier to blame someone else than accept responsibility. Sure, there's a nugget of truth in what they complain about, but at the end of the day, our actions and words are our responsibility, and we are never forced to do what we don't want to do.\n\nI can't talk too much about our contracts with the show, but let me say this: It's very, very clear that, as contestants, our actions and words are our responsibility, including alcohol consumption. But in reality, the producers are always there to help when things get fuzzy.\n\nIt's common knowledge that there is alcohol on the show. But what I want people to know is that my friends and I were never once prodded or forced to drink alcohol. Hell, the furthest production goes is asking what type of beverage you'd like. And saying \"water\" is a perfectly fine response. On BIP season three, none of us imbibed to the point of being more than \"tipsy,\" except Chad \u2014 and he readily admits that he did that on his own, with no prodding. BIP naturally creates several degrees of pressure. Pressure because there's cameras and pressure to find a match. The fascinating part to watch is how people deal with that pressure. Some get very quiet, some drink too much, and some, like me, do ridiculous things like fake my own death. That's what makes the show interesting to watch. Alcohol is treated with the respect it deserves, and sometimes contestants are asked to stop. In fact, I wasn't allowed to drink for two weeks because of medication I was taking, and although I badly wanted a glass of wine for rose ceremonies, the staff would come running from all directions to stop me when I tried to sneak a sip or order a drink. I've watched staff and producers stop many situations before they became a problem, even at the expense of making \"great TV.\" Their interventions were not only beneficial, but also truly assisted in my process of finding love.\n\nThere were many amazing people on staff to assist us when we were doing something stupid, but Chris Harrison and [bartender] Jorge are truly great men. Jorge was our sage, our muse and our shoulder to cry on. Harrison was there to chat at rose ceremonies and for the always dramatic interventions. Jorge and Harrison, like the producers, have two goals: to reveal character and assist in finding love. Great TV naturally follows both of those things. The cast grows very close with the producers. There are hours and hours of unaired interviews where we talk about heart and soul issues. The producers helped guide me to a place where I was able to break down the barrier of my heart that \"I wasn't good enough for Carly\" \u2026 and \"I'm not good enough for love.\" I had deep wounds in my heart, and \u2014 I'm crying as I'm writing this \u2014 they helped me heal. And that's what they do \u2014 help us navigate feelings and make decisions that are in line with our values when we get stuck. They are always watching and always approachable for us when we need them. The producers I know would never allow someone to do something against their will or get to a place where something bad would occur. That's what makes this situation so tough. I know this cast and the production staff so well, I find this alleged situation unimaginable.\n\nOn the other hand, I think we are all glad the production staff, ABC and Warner Bros. are taking it seriously. I know for a fact that no one on the show would want anyone to be violated in any way for ratings. The show doesn't cast intentionally bad people. Sometimes contestants are misguided, ridiculous and narcissistic, but no one shows up ready to hurt someone. I don't know DeMario [Jackson], but the castmembers I've spoken to that have gotten to know him say he's a good guy. I just don't believe that he thought he was hurting Corinne or that he knew she wasn't able to give consent. But that's where all men can learn. Getting approval not just once but multiple times is the right thing and should become our society's norm. In our society, we must learn to go above and beyond to make sure people feel safe. And I think the show is doing that by shutting down production to ensure they've done everything they can do to guarantee safety.\n\nAnother thing I often hear people trying to discredit the show say is, \"There's no way you can find love in a matter of weeks.\" or \"How could you really find love in a month?\" Well, it's quite amazing, actually. We spend all day, every day with our fellow castmates. In a \"real life\" dating situation, you go on a date for a few hours, text a bit, maybe set up another date a few days later, and you do that for a few months. So Paradise condenses it. You quickly find out almost everything about a potential match, especially the important stuff. There is no \"ghosting\" or hiding behind phones. If you do run, the show holds you accountable. But really, you watch how people interact with others, what pisses them off, how they respond to pressure, even what foods they like. It was adorable watching Carly order avocado, eggs and a black coffee every single morning (and she still tries to have that for breakfast every day). Spending quality time with others is a lost art to the game of texting, but Paradise brings back QT. Carly and I sat on a beach for weeks talking. At first I creeped her out, but because of the time allowed to just hang after she friend-zoned me, she came to realize that she not only liked my flavor of creepiness, but wanted to marry it as well!\n\nI'm sure people will say I drank the Paradise Kool-Aid, got paid to write nice things \u2014 which I didn't \u2014 or whatever, but I truly believe in the show and its production staff. They are all good people who work harder than anyone I've ever met and are genuinely fighting for love, and a great story. I believe I have one of the most epic love stories of any reality TV love, and I don't want these stories to end. I'm sure adjustments will be made, but ultimately one bad incident does not have to tarnish a show's legacy, and I'm sure as hell not going to let it affect my relationship with Carly in any way. I am incredibly grateful to the producers, the staff and everyone involved in Paradise for choosing to illuminate my story and help me become a better man.\n\nBut beyond the cast, the Bachelor shows are important to millions. The shows are a beautiful juxtaposition of parody and melodrama that illuminate our own lives. Paradise and the other shows bring people together by helping us see our own ridiculousness. Live-tweeting has become a collective event. The shows, and especially Paradise, break stereotypes and help people learn about themselves as human beings. We identify with some of the characters, and we think about our experiences with people similar to those shown on the screen. I've received countless tweets and comments that Carly and I have strengthened relationships because couples identify with us. One girl said she was able to find love because her guy \"is a lot like you, Evan.\" She ended up giving him a chance, and now they're happy. Another girl wrestled with self-hate and said watching us gave her hope. You may say I'm being too dramatic about a TV show, and I am definitely biased, but reading the awesome comments and watching the very real positive outcomes people have from watching make me happy.\n\nThe show also highlights important topics the public wrestles with. This \"scandal\" has had the unintended consequence of bringing the discussion about \"consent\" to the forefront of people's minds. Frankly, although the circumstances suck and no one wishes harm on anyone, the learning edge of this has been powerful. We all want healthy relationships and to be treated with respect. And as this plays out, it will help many people treat consent on a new level and understand personal responsibility versus the duty of others to act. The show has recently introduced Rachel [Lindsay] as the first African-American lead, and she is doing a fantastic job as the Bachelorette. Healthy conversations about race are happening everywhere because of it.\n\nLet me reiterate that I do not want to downplay the seriousness of this very difficult situation. My heart goes out to Corinne and everyone negatively affected by this. I pray for peace and healing to begin and personal growth for all. And Paradise must come back, if not this season, then next season. I want to watch love form and grow on ABC Mondays and Tuesdays. I want to watch the next steady Jade and Tanner and also the next roller-coaster relationship like I had. Love always wins, and I trust in Paradise.\n\nEvan Bass was a contestant on season 12 of The Bachelorette and on the third season of Bachelor in Paradise."}

The characters are worldly in a way that Orange County kids aren't.\"[5] The characteristics for each character in the pilot were based on the first Gossip Girl book.[6] In January 2007, the show was given the green light by The CW.[7]\n\nProduction team [ edit ]\n\nThe O.C. creator Josh Schwartz and fellow writer Stephanie Savage served as the show's executive producers throughout the series' run, followed by Bob Levy and Leslie Morgenstein of Alloy Entertainment, who were assigned in aiding the adaptation of the novels into the series.[7] Following the success of Gossip Girl, Gilmore Girls co-producer, John Stephens was approached by Schwartz and Savage, having previously worked with him on The O.C., and hired him as an executive producer.[8] Joshua Safran, who started as a writer/consulting producer before becoming co-executive producer, was later added as an executive producer. On April 24, 2012, it was announced that he would leave the show at the end of the fifth season to be the new showrunner of NBC's now-cancelled musical series Smash.[9] To fill in Safran's void, co-executive producer Sara Goodman was promoted to executive producer for the sixth season.[10] Alexandra Patsavas who worked with Schwartz on The O.C. was in charge of the music.[11] Eric Daman was at the head of the costume department; he previously had assisted Patricia Field on Sex and the City.[12]\n\nCasting [ edit ]\n\nVeronica Mars was canceled, the following season of pilots for The CW had been announced, and one was Gossip Girl. I read it, and I knew I was sort of old to play any of the kids. I called Veronica Mars, can I narrate this show? And she said, 'Hey, that's a very good idea.' They knew I had a younger voice, they liked me and they knew I'd show up for work, and I guess that was all I really needed. It was so clear to me how sassy and catty she needed to be. Whenwas canceled, the following season of pilots for The CW had been announced, and one was. I read it, and I knew I was sort of old to play any of the kids. I called Dawn Ostroff -- who was the head of The CW at the time -- and said, 'Hey, I did so much narration on, can I narrate this show? And she said, 'Hey, that's a very good idea.' They knew I had a younger voice, they liked me and they knew I'd show up for work, and I guess that was all I really needed. It was so clear to me how sassy and catty she needed to be. \u2014 Kristen Bell on how she landed the narration spot of the show[13]\n\nFeaturing nine regular speaking roles, the majority of the ensemble cast was assembled from February to April 2007. Leighton Meester and Blake Lively\u2013who started auditioning in December 2006[14]\u2013were the first two actresses to be chosen in February for the lead roles of Blair Waldorf and Serena van der Woodsen, respectively.[15] Penn Badgley, who had previously worked with Stephanie Savage on The Mountain,[14] Taylor Momsen, Chace Crawford, Kelly Rutherford, and Connor Paolo also auditioned successfully and landed roles in the series in March, as did Florencia Lozano who appeared only in the pilot, and was later replaced by Margaret Colin.[16][17][18] Badgley at first turned down the part of Dan,[19] as did Lively\u2014who planned to attend college\u2014for the role of Serena.[20] Actors for the roles of Chuck Bass and Rufus Humphrey were found in April when English actor Ed Westwick, and Matthew Settle were cast.[21] Westwick first read for the role of Nate but was then asked to try Chuck.[14] As rumors swirled about the impending cancellation of Veronica Mars, it was revealed at The CW's 2007 Upfronts on May 17, 2007, that Kristen Bell had narrated the pilot, thus making her the title character of another show on the network.[22] Jessica Szohr was signed on to portray the recurring role of Vanessa Abrams and received regular status during the fourteenth episode of the first season.[23][24] Kaylee DeFer joined the series in the eighteenth episode of the fourth season and was promoted to series regular for the show's fifth season.[25]\n\nAt the conclusion of the fourth season, Momsen, who went on an indefinite hiatus during the season while retaining regular billing,[26][27] and Jessica Szohr both left the show.[28] Throughout the series' run, Connor Paolo consistently declined to elevate his recurring role of Eric van der Woodsen to regular status, citing personal reasons for his decision.[29] After becoming a regular on the ABC series Revenge, Paolo confirmed his departure from Gossip Girl in August 2011.[30]\n\nAs the show progressed, numerous recurring guest stars appeared in the show. Michelle Trachtenberg signed on to portray Georgina Sparks.[31] The role had previously been offered to Mischa Barton who declined the role.[31] Francie Swift and Sam Robards took the parental roles of Anne and Howard Archibald, respectively.[32][33] Caroline Lagerfelt portrayed Celia \"CeCe\" Rhodes, Serena and Eric's grandmother and Lily's mother.[34] Sebastian Stan made several appearances as Carter Baizen throughout the show's first three seasons.[35]\n\nFilming locations [ edit ]\n\nPrimarily filming in New York, Gossip Girl has been declared by New York Magazine as the \"Most Restauranty Show Since Sex and the City\", citing the pilot episode filming locales such as the Japanese restaurant, Geisha, the Campbell Apartment where Nate and Serena were filmed having sex and the New York Palace Hotel bar Gilt.[36] Other New York City landmarks and well-known establishments were filmed throughout the first season. Victor/Victrola filmed the fictional infamous Chuck Bass burlesque club, Victrola, at The Box Manhattan, a sister club to The Box Soho in London.[37] The fictional Constance Billard-St.Judes School, based on novel writer Cecil Von Ziegesar's alma mater, Nightingale-Bamford used external shots of the Museum of the City of New York.[38]\n\nThe second season premiered at the Hamptons and began filming in mid-June. The season premiere opening montage showed a scene at Cooper's Beach that was instead filmed in Rockaway Beach followed by an elaborate white party.[39][40] For the sixth episode of the season, Columbia University was used to film the Yale campus, an episode that followed disappointment from Yale fans due to its erroneous portrayal of the admissions process and reliance on Ivy League university stereotypes.[41] During the season's seventh episode, the Brooklyn Inn was integrated into the show.[42] Remaining true to its New York locations, the show filmed at the Russian Tea Room.[43][44]\n\nThe fourth season premiered on September 13, 2010, with the first two episodes filmed in Paris.[45][46] New York Magazine revealed several locations shot at the French University, La Sorbonne in the Latin District (or Quartier Latin) of Paris on July 5.[47][48] Other locations include the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, the Eiffel Tower, the Gare du Nord, Avenue Montaigne.[49] and Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s. Columbia University became the primary filming location for the first few episodes of the season following the Paris story arc.[50]\n\nThe fifth season premiered on September 26, 2011, with the first two episodes filmed in Los Angeles, California.[51]\n\nBecause of its location in New York, executive producer Stephanie Savage said, \"We were quickly told it would be too expensive, too complicated\" at the beginning of the series. She said that it had been proposed to shoot in a Los Angeles studio that would recreate Central Park, but they eventually filmed the series in New York.[52] Savage explained their choice to film there, \"There's no New York City on TV, or there wasn't when we started making the pilot, except what you could see in the background behind the dead bodies on cop shows. We've never seen the city from the point of view of teenagers. It felt like a world with high stakes for young people.\" Schwartz added, \"What's funny about these teenagers is they grew up watching Sex and the City, even though it wasn't about them. And I think they've probably incorporated that into how they mythologize New York. I fought really hard to shoot the show in New York because we want New York to be a character in the show.\"[53] Many scenes were filmed in the Empire Hotel on the Upper West Side.[54]\n\nEpisode format [ edit ]\n\nEach episode begins with the home page of the Gossip Girl website and Serena's picture from the pilot episode. Afterward, a recap of events relevant to the upcoming narrative is shown, which ends again with the home page of the website, only this time with a picture from other character(s) with a text about a recent event connected with the picture.\n\nThe narrator is Gossip Girl, voiced by actress Kristen Bell. She begins the recap with the sentence, \"Gossip Girl here, your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite,\" and ends the recap with whispered voices saying \"Where has she been?\" and \"Serena.\" Then, the voice of Gossip Girl says, \"And who am I? That's one secret I'll never tell! You know you love me\u2026 XOXO, Gossip Girl.\"\n\nDuring each episode, there is always a social event taking place, whether small or large. Joshua Safran explained, \"We structure it [the show] so that every week, the episode leads to an event. I feel like it is much like a procedural.\"[6]\n\nEpisode titles [ edit ]\n\nAll of the episodes' titles are based on the name of a film or a novel.[55] For example, episode \"The Wild Brunch\" evokes western film The Wild Bunch and \"Seventeen Candles\" Sixteen Candles.[55] Episode \"All About My Brother\" refers to Pedro Almod\u00f3var's All About My Mother while \"Pret-a-Poor-J\" came from Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-Porter.[55] \"There Might Be Blood\" took its title from 2007 film There Will Be Blood.[55] \"The Serena Also Rises\" was titled after novel The Sun Also Rises. The fifth-season episode \"The Big Sleep No More\" was named for the film The Big Sleep and the New York-based production Sleep No More. Episode \"Easy J\" was titled after Emma Stone's hit movie Easy A. Episode \"The Age of Dissonance\", which was titled after Edith Wharton's novel The Age of Innocence, saw a high school production of the novel taking place,[55] and \"The Blair Bitch Project\" was named after The Blair Witch Project. \"Victor, Victrola\" is named after the British-American musical comedy Victor/Victoria. \"Bad News Blair\" was named after the 1976 movie The Bad News Bears.\n\nJoshua Safran said, \"we draw from classic works like Les Liaisons Dangereuses and The Great Gatsby as much as we do from pop culture.\"[6]\n\nProduct placement [ edit ]\n\n\"It was really about showing features on a device. We usually do about between six and eight scenes in a season of 'Gossip Girl' -- you can't get that in many shows -- where the characters are using their devices. Initially, it was just a wireless phone, but eventually that became a smartphone, a tablet, all these other types of technology that took them through their day and showed how they used it to get from one place to the next.\" \u2014 Barbra Robin, Senior Vice President, Integrated Marketing[56]\n\nGossip Girl is known for its product placement. The show had a contract with Verizon Wireless for its first five seasons; all the characters were seen with phones chosen by the brand until the deal ended by the sixth season.[57] During their contract, Verizon Wireless offered exclusive Gossip Girl content and created a website where ringtones of the songs featured on the show could be downloaded.[58] In the summer of 2008, executives of VitaminWater approached The CW for a placement deal. During the second season, the drinks were mentioned several times in dialogues. The partnership helped pay the costs of shooting on location in the Hamptons.[59] An HP TouchPad was prominently displayed in an episode of the sixth season.[60] According to OneNewsNow.com, other sponsors have included Procter & Gamble, L'Oreal, Target and Johnson & Johnson, which allowed the series to earn $28.2 million in ad dollars in 2007.[61]\n\nCast and characters [ edit ]\n\nMain cast [ edit ]\n\nSelected recurring cast [ edit ]\n\nSeries overview [ edit ]\n\nSeason 1: 2007\u20132008 [ edit ]\n\nFollowing a mysterious disappearance, Serena Van der Woodsen suddenly returns to the Upper East Side from boarding school to visit her suicidal brother, Eric. Shock spreads across the Upper East Side as the first sightings of her spread across the Gossip Girl website. Blair Waldorf soon discovers Serena had slept with her boyfriend, Nate Archibald, the night of her disappearance. Meanwhile, Brooklynite Dan Humphrey and Serena begin dating while Nate struggles with his feelings for Blair. Nate and Blair try to salvage their relationship, driving Blair to lose her virginity to Nate's best friend, Chuck Bass. Jenny Humphrey, Dan\u2019s sister, is trying to fit in to the Upper East Side by following around Blair and her friends. Vanessa Abrams, Dan's best friend, returns. It is revealed that Dan had confessed his love for Vanessa in the past, but the two move beyond this as friends. It is discovered that Lily Van der Woodsen, Serena\u2019s mother, and Rufus Humphrey, Dan\u2019s father, have a romantic past and begin to rekindle their romance. The two decide to see other people in light of their children's romance. Blair and Nate eventually break up, after finally having sex, despite her affair with Chuck. Nate discovers the affair, causing a rift with Chuck. Throughout the season, Chuck tries to seduce Blair and the two somewhat come to terms with their feelings for each other. Georgina Sparks, past friend of Serena, returns and causes havoc, including outing Eric Van der Woodsen as gay. Georgina's return reminds Serena of the real reason she left the Upper East Side. Problems erupt between Dan and Serena, as Serena tries to hide her secret from him. Georgina pretends to be a woman named Sarah from Portland and befriends Dan and Vanessa. It is revealed that Serena left the Upper East Side because she was involved in a drug-related death and felt responsible for the situation. However, the incident is resolved with Serena being absolved of her guilt and Georgina leaves. Dan and Serena decide to end their relationship. Meanwhile, Lily accepts a marriage proposal from Bart Bass, despite her feelings for Rufus, and the season ends with a Bass wedding and Blair waiting for Chuck at the airport.\n\nSeason 2: 2008\u20132009 [ edit ]\n\nThe second season mainly explores the senior year of the characters with the premiere at the Hamptons and primarily focused on the relationship between Blair and Chuck, who were labeled \"the heart of GG\" by People magazine.[62] At first, both characters negate their feelings for one another, and go through random schemes and manipulations.\n\nThe first half of the season deals with Serena's growing prominence as a socialite, which draws the attention of Blair as their friendship is tested when the character of Poppy Lifton (Tamara Feldman) arrives, a socialite who inadvertently drives a wedge between Serena and Blair after inspiring Serena to take her place in the spotlight during the early episodes of the season. Serena and Dan get back together for a brief period of time and eventually break up due to complications.[63] Nate faces the aftermath of his father's criminal past and pursues a relationship with Vanessa, who becomes entangled in the world of the Upper East Side. Jenny reignites her rebellious nature by pursuing a career as a fashion designer, thereby challenging Rufus' skills as a parent while Dan's friendship with Nate and relationship with Serena slowly transforms him from a social outcast to an insider. The show finished its first half during the first week of December, with the shocking death of Bart Bass.\n\nThe second half of the season reveals the impact of Bart's death, causing a significant change of character direction for Chuck that subsequently leads to the growth of Rufus and Lily's relationship, the revelation of the two having a son together, and contributing to the decline of Dan and Serena's relationship. John Shea reprised his role as Harold Waldorf during a Thanksgiving episode and becomes entangled in Blair's striving ambition of attending Yale. Desmond Harrington entered the series as Chuck's manipulative uncle, Jack Bass. Feldman returned to the season with Armie Hammer as Serena's new love interest, Gabriel Edwards.[64] Michelle Trachtenberg returned to the role of Georgina Sparks and filmed her scenes during February, also adjoining her character's return to the second season mystery.[65]\n\nA backdoor pilot for a spin-off premiered in May, but was not picked up by The CW, due to the limited number of spots available on their fall line-up.[66]\n\nAs the storylines progressed, the role of \"Gossip Girl\" is slightly decreased. She continues to run her blog, but she keeps the ultimate information for herself, sending it in the final episode as the last blast, where Serena decides to find out who \"Gossip Girl\" really is, but ultimately fails. The season finale ended with a well-received kiss between Blair and Chuck.\n\nSeason 3: 2009\u20132010 [ edit ]\n\nThe third season focuses on Blair, Dan and Vanessa getting into New York University along with movie star Olivia Burke (Hilary Duff),[67] whom Dan starts dating; Nate getting into Columbia University; Serena taking a year off from school; Jenny becoming Queen Bee at Constance; and Chuck running Bass Industries, along with now adoptive mother Lily van der Woodsen. The first couple of episodes feature part of the summer vacation, respectively the week before the start of University classes and school. The role of \"Gossip Girl\" is slightly decreased throughout the season.\n\nMany guest stars were cast throughout the season including Joanna Garc\u00eda as Bree Buckley, a love interest for Nate; America's Next Top Model creator Tyra Banks as Ursula Nyquist, a larger than life actress whom Serena served as a publicist for a short time; William Baldwin as William van der Woodsen, Serena and Eric\u2019s father, Lily\u2019s ex-husband and Rufus\u2019 long-time rival; and cameos by Lady Gaga, Tory Burch, Jimmy Fallon, Plastiscines, Georgina Chapman and Sonic Youth.[68][69][70]\n\nThe ninth episode of the season caused a significant amount of controversy. Parent groups urged The CW not to air the episode as it contained a threesome. The preview for the episode revolved around an \"OM3\" theme. CW ignored these requests and announced that it was going to air the episode as planned.[71]\n\nRobert John Burke, who played Chuck's father, Bart Bass, returned for A Christmas Carol themed episode in December, while Desmond Harrington returned as Chuck's uncle Jack with a major storyline affecting Chuck and Blair's relationship again and involving Chuck's estranged mother Evelyn Bass Fisher (Laura Harring).[72][73]\n\nThe season focused hugely on Jenny Humphrey's development and downward spiral. She spends a good part of the season alienating herself from Eric, her former best friend, and chasing after Nate, who has his heart set on Serena. At the end of the season, due to her one night stand with Chuck Bass, and new drug dealing habit, Jenny's father and Lily send her to Hudson, New York, to live with her mother. Other story lines include: Blair and Chuck's attempt and ultimate failure at having a successful relationship; Dan and Vanessa moving from friends to something more; and Serena's attempts to find herself through a new job and brief love affairs with Carter, Nate's married cousin Tripp, and eventually Nate himself. The season ends dramatically with Chuck getting robbed and shot.\n\nSeason 4: 2010\u20132011 [ edit ]\n\nSeason four's main mystery revolves around Juliet Sharp (Katie Cassidy), a secretive girl with an agenda against Serena involving her past. The second half of the season builds on the complications of Serena's new found relationship with her former teacher Colin, Chuck trying to regain control of Bass Industries from Russell Thorpe (Michael Boatman), and Dan and Blair's growing friendship. The season also focuses on Lily's past betrayals coming back to haunt her; Chuck and Blair's tumultuous relationship after their break up; Dan and Vanessa's deteriorating friendship; and the arrival of Serena's cousin Charlie Rhodes (Kaylee DeFer) to the Upper East Side. By the end of the season, Blair has ignored Chuck, Dan has told Vanessa they are no longer friends, and Serena is on that single grind.\n\nThe first two episodes of the season took place with Serena, Blair, and Chuck in Paris. While in Paris, Blair meets Prince Louis Grimaldi, to whom she later becomes engaged at the end of the season.\n\nTaylor Momsen, who plays Jenny Humphrey, was absent for the majority of the season but made appearances in \"Easy J\", \"Juliet Doesn't Live Here Anymore\", \"The Witches of Bushwick\", and \"Gaslit\".[74]\n\nSeason 5: 2011\u20132012 [ edit ]\n\nThe series was renewed by The CW for a fifth season on April 26, 2011.[75]\n\nOn May 9, 2011, it was announced that Taylor Momsen and Jessica Szohr would not be back as series regulars, although both have been invited back as guest stars. Kaylee DeFer, who portrays Ivy Dickens, was promoted to series regular status for season 5.[76]\n\nThe season began in Los Angeles when a re-energized Chuck and Nate decided to pay Serena a visit. Chuck has a newfound philosophy and says \"yes\" to everything, even death defying stunts. Serena continues to work on the movie set, and is offered a full-time job at the end of the episode. Nate begins an affair with an older woman, Diana Payne, who may have an ulterior motive for being with Nate. Back in New York, Dan learns that Vanessa has published one chapter of his novel, and Blair continues to plan her wedding to Louis, and she also learns she is pregnant. After realizing she still had feelings for Chuck, Blair and Chuck decide to go away together, but their car crashes. As a result of the crash Blair loses her baby, Chuck nearly dies, and Blair eventually marries Louis. The season also focuses on Nate running an online gossip site NYSpectator, Blair and Dan's friendship turning into a relationship, Chuck's quest to find his real parents which leads him to discover that his father, Bart, is still alive, and the effects of CeCe's death on Lily and her marriage to Rufus. At the end of the season, Blair makes a choice between Dan and Chuck, and Lily makes a choice between Rufus and Bart. Serena is seen leaving town while Dan decides to write a new book about the Upper East Side, with the help of Georgina.\n\nSeason 6: 2012 [ edit ]\n\nOn May 11, 2012, it was announced Gossip Girl would return for a shortened sixth and final season, which premiered on October 8, 2012.[1][77] During the CW upfronts, network president Mark Pedowitz said the number of episodes had not yet been decided and could consist of 10, 11, or 13 episodes with a retrospective, meaning it would end before Christmas.[78]\n\nThe season premiered with 0.78 million viewers tuning in, marking a series low for the show. The following week, there was a further drop in viewership, with only 0.76 million viewers, once again breaking the record for series-low ratings.\n\nOn October 29, 2012, the episode \"Portrait of a Lady Alexander\" was postponed due to the impact of Hurricane Sandy on the Eastern Seaboard. Widespread power outages led to the decision of pushing the new episode back a week and re-airing the previous episode, \"Dirty Rotten Scandal\".[79]\n\nOn December 17, 2012, the series broadcast its finale on U.S. television on the CW network. Actress Kristen Bell, the narrator of the series during all seasons makes a cameo as herself (but is not revealed as Gossip Girl). Several former Gossip Girl cast members appear in the finale, including Jessica Szohr, who played Vanessa Abrams, and Katie Cassidy, who played Juliet Sharp. Former series regulars Connor Paolo (Eric van der Woodsen) and Taylor Momsen (Jenny Humphrey), each appear also with one line a piece.\n\nSeason 6 begins with Chuck and Blair who part ways after making a pact that they will unite once they both achieve their individual goals. Chuck goes on his way to try to regain Bass Industries from his father who stole it from him while Blair tries to find herself and her individuality by taking over her mother\u2019s company at her mother's request. Serena pursues a relationship with someone older and who happens to have a 17-year-old daughter, Sage who will do anything to try to split them up. Nate focuses on trying to get the Spectator to become successful and dates Sage. Meanwhile, Dan focuses on completing his second book with Georgina\u2019s help. In the end after a surprising turn of events Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester) and Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick) get married.[80] In the final moments the series speeds forward five years later where Chuck and Blair are revealed to have had a child and Nate Archibald appears successful and is rumored to be running for Mayor of New York. The show ends with the wedding of Serena van der Woodsen and Dan Humphrey. It's a small ceremony, in what looks like Blair and Chuck's home together, where Lily is with Serena and Eric's father, William, and Rufus seems to be happy with another woman (musician Lisa Loeb, who guest-starred in the first season) along with Dorota, Nate, Jack Bass and Georgina (who are now together), Jenny and Eric. A brief shot of The Spectator reveals that Lola Rhodes and Olivia Burke are now starring in a film about Ivy Dickens, based on her best-selling autobiography.\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nCritical response [ edit ]\n\nGossip Girl poster featuring critical review poster featuring critical review\n\nGossip Girl initially received positive reviews. Due to the show's pedigree as an adaptation of The New York Times bestselling novel series, the show was considered to be one of the more anticipated new shows of the 2007\u20132008 television season. An August 2007 survey by OTX, a global media research and consulting firm, placed the show on the list of top ten new shows that viewers were aware of.[81] Though the pilot was the recipient of many positive reviews from publications such as Variety, The Washington Post, San Francisco Chronicle and the Boston Globe, other reviewers described it as a guilty pleasure rather than an hour's worth of must-watch television.[82][83][84][85] Metacritic gave it a score of 54, based on the reviews of 26 different publications.[86]\n\nToward the conclusion of the first season, Janet Malcolm of The New Yorker criticized the show for its deviations from the novels. She has stated that the series was \"related to the original only in the names and outlines of the characters\". She further asserted that, \"Without von Ziegesar's fast, mocking commentary to propel them, the TV episodes are sluggish and crass\u2014a move from Barneys to Kmart.\"[87] However, author Cecily von Ziegesar has expressed support for the show, noting that all of her major plot points were present in the pilot.[88]\n\nAs the show continued its first season, the response became considerably more positive, and by the second season critical response was favorable. Metacritic gave the new season an improved score of 71. \"Summer's been good to this girl,\" claimed Entertainment Weekly, who awarded the series its highest grade of \"A\".[89] The New York Daily News claimed the show had found its footing by stating \"It knows exactly what it wants and needs its new hybrid product to be. The hockey fights video of teen romance drama.\" Gossip Girl was designated the \"Greatest Teen Drama of All Time\" by New York magazine.[90] The magazine wrote, \"the show has resurrected the potential for scripted dramas to be effective social satire\u2014to present a world more accurately than a \"reality\" program can. Gossip Girl presents a wealth-eye view of the city, but because it is a cartoon we can laugh along with the conspicuousness of the consumption.\"[91]\n\nThe Parents Television Council has shown particular criticism of the series, especially with its \"OMFG\" ad campaign from April 2008.[92] It also named the episode \"Victor/Victrola\" the worst television program of the week in which the episode originally was broadcast.[93] Quotes from the Parents Television Council review, as well as negative quotes from the San Diego Union-Tribune, New York Post and the Boston Herald, were used on various advertisements for the second season. The Hartford Courant chronicled a variety of negative responses to the ads. The ads included quotes like \"Every Parent's Nightmare\", \"Mind-Blowingly Inappropriate\" and \"A Nasty Piece of Work\" in what appears to be an effort to continue the 'rebellious teen' style of the show.[94][95]\n\nWith the approach of the fifth season, New York Magazine reviewed the life expectancy of the show, noting its waning cultural relevancy despite the growing prominence of its actors, and the loss of its status as The CW's No.1 show, having been beaten out in terms of ratings by other shows of the network like Supernatural and 90210. \"The series itself hasn't quite kept up, even if its plotting is as juicy and lunatic as ever.\" and that \"The cast would all rather be making movies, while the showrunners are focusing on launching new projects via their nascent Fake Empire production company (including CW newcomer Hart of Dixie). Barring an unexpected brand reboot or another stab at a spinoff, we're afraid the end is near. XOXO.\"[96] AOL TV ranked Gossip Girl the 20th Best School Show of All Time and the 4th TV's Biggest Guilty Pleasure.[97][98] The show was declared the tenth highest rated show for the first ten years of IMDb.com Pro (2002-2012).[99]\n\nThere was much controversy around Dan being revealed as Gossip Girl in the season finale. Dan had always struggled to be an insider among the Upper East Side and had supposedly created Gossip Girl to gain more power and had been the one \"pulling the strings the whole time\" as mentioned by Serena in the finale. However, there was much speculation and controversy regarding this decision. Penn Badgley, who played Dan, stated in an interview that he himself found it funny that they had decided to make him be Gossip Girl as there were too many loopholes in the show for this to make sense. There were times during the show where he would be alone and read a Gossip Girl post and be completely blown away by it.\n\nCultural influence [ edit ]\n\n[Schwartz and Savage] were spearheading: \"What if the Internet is just a place to judge people? What if that\u2019s what it turns into?\" And they turned out to be Nostradamus. \u2014 Kristen Bell on Gossip Girl depicting social media's influence[20]\n\nCW executive Dawn Ostroff later compared Gossip Girl's role as the show that defined its network to House of Cards for Netflix. Its television audience was never very large, but the show was influential on culture; Savage recalled that the crew likened working on it to working for a lifestyle magazine. A hairstylist for the show compared media interest in Lively's hair to that for Jennifer Aniston's \"The Rachel\".[20] In 2008, The New York Times reported the show has had a profound impact on retail, saying Gossip Girl is probably \"the first [show] to have been conceived, in part, as a fashion marketing vehicle\". While it has had middling success in terms of ratings, it \"may well be the biggest influence in the youth culture market\", said a trendspotter.[100] According to Zoe Fox of Mashable, the show popularized social media networks and mobile communication, becoming \"a pioneer in its use of mobile\".[101] In 2008, New York Magazine named the series as \"Best Show Ever\".[90] In 2009, Rolling Stone named the series as \"TV's Hottest Show\".[102]\n\nOn January 26, 2012, in honor of the series' 100th episode, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg visited the set and proclaimed the date Gossip Girl Day, citing the show's cultural influence and impact on the economy of the city. \"Gossip Girl has made New York a central character. While Gossip Girl is drawing fans in with its plot twists, the show also attracts many of them to visit New York, contributing to our incredible 50.5 million visitors last year. In fact, the economic impact of Gossip Girl and other television shows and films that are made in New York really can be felt directly in all five boroughs.

Fans stride into boutiques bearing magazine tear sheets that feature members of the cast and ask for their exact outfits. Or they order scoop-neck tops and hobo bags by following e-commerce links from the show\u2019s Web site. The New York Times, 2008[100]\n\nGossip Girl was very influential on fashion for teenage and young adult women. The show was intended in part as a way for fashion companies to market their products. Some brands paid a fee, and the show's Web site provided referral links so viewers could purchase items they saw on television.[100] In 2009, Anna Sui created a line inspired by Gossip Girl.[157] Daman, who based his costumes on what Manhattan private-school students wore,[100], said that by the sixth season the show was \"getting one-of-a-kind couture from Paris\", because \"they wanted their wares on Blake Lively\".[158]\n\nOn September 16, 2011, it was announced that Warner Bros. and label Romeo & Juliet Couture had partnered to create Gossip Girl's official clothing line inspired by lead characters Serena van der Woodsen and Blair Waldorf.[159] The launch of the fashion line took place on September 26, 2011, the same day as the premiere of the fifth season.[160]\n\nCosmetics online retailer Birchbox and Gossip Girl have teamed up to create a special Birchbox edition filled with beauty products inspired by the show. The products were chosen by Gossip Girl's makeup department head, Amy Tagliamonti, and hair department head, Jennifer Johnson.[161]\n\nInternational adaptations [ edit ]\n\nGossip Girl spawned several adaptations in other countries. The Turkish version is known as K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck S\u0131rlar (Little Secrets).[162] On March 5, 2012, it was reported that Warner Bros. International Television and Metan Development Group would produce a Chinese teen drama series called China Girl inspired by Gossip Girl. Production was set to start in June 2012 with the show airing in November. The show will follow the lives of students at a university instead of a high school.[163] No news of the actual broadcast followed.\n\nA Mexican version of the series was produced by Mexican producer Pedro Torres as Gossip Girl: Acapulco.[164] The show stars Sof\u00eda Sisniega, Oka Giner, Jon Ecker, Vadhir Derbez, Diego Amozurrutia, and Macarena Achaga.[165] Filming of the Mexican adaptation began in January 2013 and the series aired in July 5, 2013, on Televisa.[166][167] The show also aired in the United States on Univision in 2014.[168] It was not renewed for a second season.\n\nAnother version of Gossip Girl aired in Thailand on Channel 3 beginning July 16, 2015, dubbed as Gossip Girl: Thailand.[169]"}
{"label": true, "txt": "Given that it took place almost 12 years ago, you may not remember much from Natalie Portman\u2019s first guest-hosting gig on Saturday Night Live. But if you remember anything, odds are it\u2019s the S.N.L. Digital Short she collaborated on with Andy Samberg where sweet, intellectual, child star Portman transformed herself into a gutter-mouthed rap star. Well, Portman, Samberg, and the Viking helmet are all back for another go at, well, basically the same thing. In other words: once more, with Jar Jar.\n\nWith Beck Bennett in the Chris Parnell role as an interviewer both bemused by and scared of Portman\u2019s rap persona, the Annihilation star takes us all on a tour of what she\u2019s been up to in the intervening years. (As Bennett\u2019s character notes, it\u2019s pretty much the same sketch as before\u2014with more current references.) Black Swan, Portman\u2019s kids, and her ballerino husband all get a shout-out in this updated sketch. The sequel may not be quite as successful as the first attempt (mostly because it lacks the element of surprise), but a Samberg cameo is always welcome.\n\nThe most topical reference of all, however, is Portman\u2019s fierce, violent respect for the controversial Star Wars prequels. Defending them is all the rage these days."}

When she did arrive, joining the students gathered around his impromptu memorial, it was more shocking than a slushie facial.\n\n\"Before Finn, I used to sing alone,\" she told the glee club before delivering the episode's most poignant performance, Bob Dylan's \"Make You Feel My Love.\"\n\nNothing was more gut-wrenching than when she told Matthew Morrison's Mr. Schue, \"He was my person.\"\n\nThen she handed him a plaque she'd had made, featuring a picture and quote from her \"untraditionally smart\" boyfriend that read, \"The show must go on. All over the place ... or something like that.\"\n\nAnd \"Glee\" did just that with its tribute, deftly balancing heartache with humor and respect, from its opening number (the black-clad cast singing \"Seasons of Love\" from Broadway's \"Rent\") to the closing scene: Will Schuester sobbing in Emma's (Jayma Mays) arms.\n\nMr. Schue urged the glee clubbers early in the show to memorialize Finn \"the only way we know how \u2014 by singing.\"\n\nThose performances included Mercedes' (Amber Riley) rendition of The Pretenders' \"I'll Stand By You,\" after thanking the sports stud for being the\"first cool kid to be nice to us.\" Sam (Chord Overstreet) and Artie (Kevin McHale) did a duet of James Taylor's \"Fire & Rain,\" Puck (Mark Salling) strummed his guitar along to Bruce Springsteen's \"No Surrender.\"\n\nAnd Santana (Naya Rivera) sang most of The Band Perry's \"If I Die Young\" \u2014 before fleeing the classroom, crying and screaming.\n\nShe also lashed out at Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), calling the new principal (!) a \"cold-hearted b----\" before shoving her into a cabinet.\n\nSue was characteristically callous about Finn's death \u2014 at first. \"I'm grieving. And I grieve by insulting those who mean the most to me,\" she explained.\n\nShe also ridiculed the students' memorials, saying, \"We honor Finn Hudson by ... not making a self-serving spectacle of our own sadness.\"\n\nKurt's memorial \u2014 planting a tree \u2014 was vandalized by Puck, who was also accused of swiping Finn's letterman jacket. (One of the episode's biggest tearjerkers was Kurt saying that Finn walking down his hallway in that jacket \"was like Superman had arrived.\u201d)\n\nOf course, the actual culprit was Mr. Schue, who, until the last scene of the episode, hadn't shed a tear since finding out about Finn's death.\n\nBut he made up for it in the end, weeping as he clutched Finn's jacket, the symbol of a shining star that dimmed much too soon."}

Probably for some of us our partners are our personal superheroes, but we know that deep down we dream of the God of thunder, beautiful spies stealing classified information, night watchmen, or women with pyrotechnic skills. At some point, everyone has wished to have a date with one of those characters or at least with one of the actors that played them.\n\nBut for some people, this dream has come true. Deep in their hearts everyone else envies them because they know it must be fun to be able to say that their husband, wife or even one of their parents has been defeating different villains under the spotlights of the Hollywood cameras. So, let's stop and think about it for a moment... if being a parent is already a challenge then try to picture being parents and superheroes at the same time. Anyone else would lose their minds! But Commissioner James Gordon once said \"[One has] to make a difference. A lot of time it won't be huge. It won't be visible even. But it will matter just the same\".\n\nThat's why today we will talk about those actors who have brought the world's favorite superheroes to life and have had to learn to balance their lives as parents and superheroes in the film industry.\n\n20 Gal Gadot Is The Perfect Wonder Woman\n\nGal Gadot is an Israeli actress and model, who is best known for her role in films such as Fast and Furious, and for playing the role of Wonder Woman in the film adaptation of DC comics, participating in films such as Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), Wonder Woman (2017) and Justice League (2017).\n\nAnd according to Forbes, Wonder Woman has become the most successful movie of the D.C franchise, making $ 821.74 million at the box office.

{"label": false, "txt": "The future isn't looking bright for Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban who recently attended a private counseling retreat in an attempt to save their marriage. \"Nicole and Keith went for an emergency stay,\" an insider recently revealed to In Touch of the pair, who have been married for nearly 12 years. \"It was an extremely emotional and testing few days.\" The couple's best efforts to repair their damaged relationship were unsuccessful, \"and now friends think this will end in divorce,\" the insider confessed. Simply put, there are just too many obstacles for the Oscar winner and the country superstar to overcome. During the course of their union, the two 50-year-old Australia natives have struggled to deal with Keith's addiction issues \u2014 he went to rehab four months after they wed in 2006 \u2014 as well as Nicole's anger over rumors of his infidelity. The couple, who share daughters Sunday, 9, and Faith, 7, \"have been fighting constantly over Nicole's incessant jealousy and need to control Keith on every level,\" added the insider. \"They have been putting a Band-Aid over their problems for too long. While they have smiles plastered on their faces in public, in private, things have been falling apart.\"\n\nThe counseling trip to Vermont marked their final attempt to patch things up. \"It was Keith's idea to visit the boot camp,\" the insider said. The Lion actress resisted and only relented when Keith threatened to leave for good. \"He gave her an ultimatum,\" the source said. And she knew he wasn't bluffing. The insider said their recent fights have gotten so bad that Keith has even left their Nashville home to stay overnight at a hotel. \"It's become a second home for him. Of course, there have been times she's given up and walked out on him, too,\" the source revealed. But in Vermont, the pair were side by side as they hashed out their problems. \"They addressed a range of issues, including emotional intimacy, and focused on the root of their problems as they learned to break down walls and start working on their issues rather than plastering over the cracks,\" the insider explained. They both opened up. \"Keith said he couldn't continue to live in a marriage where he felt like he was being constantly monitored like one of her children,\" the source shared. \"And Nicole ended up breaking down and spilled her heart out about how past relationships had damaged her, and she vowed to make a conscious effort to change things.\" The nearly weeklong retreat was intense. Said the insider, \"At one point it was touch-and-go whether they'd even leave together.\" They ultimately did, and yet it didn't work \u2014 their problems still remain.\n\nNicole and Keith struggled from the outset of their union. When the \"Blue Ain't Your Color\" singer moved to Nashville from Australia in the '90s, drugs \"were my thing,\" he told Rolling Stone in 2016. \"I loved them.\" By the time he met Nicole in 2005, he was seven years sober following a rehab stay in 1998. But he relapsed shortly after their 2006 wedding and checked into Betty Ford. Nicole was devastated. \"It was very, very hard to have to have her go through that,\" Keith later said. Nicole publicly stood by his side (and even hopped on a flight from Europe to be with him when she heard the news), but it was a struggle. \"It was just another twist in my life: Here it goes. Hold on, and off we go! But it was painful, deeply painful,\" she admitted to Vanity Fair in 2007. \"We were in a very, very, very bad, painful place, and have managed to step through it.\" Other problems soon replaced that one. In 2015, Keith was photographed hanging out with his opening act, fellow country singer Kelsea Ballerini, 24, on his tour bus. The photos left Nicole furious. \"She calls him out every time he's pictured with another woman,\" according to a friend. \"Keith is constantly defending himself from rumors of on-tour affairs with groupies and female singers.\"\n\nNicole \u2014 who attended this year's Oscars alone because Keith had a concert \u2014 has even admitted to keeping close tabs on him when they are apart. \"I don't like it when my husband doesn't answer his phone. I have to keep calling and calling, and I get anxious. Does that make me high-maintenance?\" she told W Magazine in 2017. Around the same time, Keith became the jealous one. A source said he became furious when he learned that Nicole pushed to get Zoe\u0308 Kravitz \u2014 the daughter of Nicole's ex-fiance\u0301 Lenny Kravitz \u2014 hired on her HBO series Big Little Lies. \"Keith feared she may still have feelings for Lenny,\" said the source. \"Nicole kept telling Keith that Zoe\u0308 is like family and it was a mutual decision between the producers that she was right for the part. Lenny had nothing to do with it, but Keith didn't care.\" Story continues after video"}
{"label": false, "txt": "Can growing up without a father be a gift? That\u2019s how Jay-Z counterintuitively described it, in his autobiography. \u201cWe were kids without fathers \u2026 and in a way, that was a gift,\u201d the rapper and businessman writes in Decoded. \u201cWe got to pick and choose the ancestors who would inspire the world we were going to make for ourselves.\u201d\n\nLow-income black fathers want to be good dads. The system won't let them | Kirk E Harris Read more\n\nIf you choose the right inspirations, growing up without a dad can be a gift. But, as the title of Jay-Z\u2019s album Blueprint 2: The Gift and the Curse suggests, there\u2019s a flip side. Many of us who spend Father\u2019s Day wishing we had somebody to celebrate with haven\u2019t chosen the right influences as substitutes. We might not be making many choices at all.\n\nI grew up without a father regularly in my life. I would leave my mom\u2019s house every morning searching for what was missing at home \u2013 the role models who could show me how to be a man. Like many kids in the same situation \u2013 and many of my peers were fatherless \u2013 I found those role models on television and in music.\n\nJay-Z was one of them: the pre-Beyonc\u00e9 Jay-Z of the late 1990s and early 2000s, big pimpin\u2019 and trading disses with fellow New York rapper Nas. His tough-guy bravado, glorification of crime, flashy jewelry and videos full of dancing women captivated me. I tried my best to emulate him and other rappers. My friends and I wanted to use drugs and thought selling them was cool; we got into fights, skipped classes and in some cases dropped out altogether. Studying seemed boring when compared with the gangster fairytales we shared. Delayed gratification, which is vital to living life with long-term benefits in mind, was a foreign concept.\n\nMy father didn\u2019t know how to be a husband to my mom or a dad to me. He had no examples from his past or his present\n\nI have no interest in blaming Jay-Z \u2013 or any other man \u2013 for playing a role in my life he didn\u2019t ask for. My father uniquely carried the responsibility of setting an example for me. But he, too, had fallen to the curse of fatherlessness. Born an orphan in Kenya, he was re-orphaned at 14 when his adoptive parents passed away. He persevered, working his way from an apprentice at the Hilton Hotel in Nairobi to a chef at the Hilton Hotel in London by the time he was 21. When the time came for him to have a family of his own, however, the curse caught up with him. He didn\u2019t know how to be a husband to my mom or a dad to me. He had no examples from his past or his present to provide guidance. Unlike the years my father spent training with other chefs to learn how to succeed in the kitchen, he had no role models to show him how to be a family man. It didn\u2019t take long for my father to give up and disappear.\n\nMy family is not alone in experiencing the curse of growing up without a dad in the house. Fatherless children are more likely to use drugs or alcohol, repeat grades in school, become teenage parents, go to prison and engage in criminal or other delinquent behaviours. A 2013 literature review by researchers from Princeton, Cornell and Berkeley universities concluded: \u201cWe find strong evidence that father absence negatively affects children\u2019s social-emotional development, particularly by increasing externalizing behavior [such as aggression and attention seeking].\u201d The review also notes these affects may be more pronounced for boys than girls.\n\n\n\nEvidently, it\u2019s not easy to fill the void \u2013 but even easier to find the wrong influences. Kids today are exposed to a much broader range of media technologies than I was in the 1990s through which to find examples for what a \u201cman\u201d is. Online communities formed through social media and discussion boards can exert their own kind of masculine peer pressure: incel (\u201cinvoluntarily celibate\u201d) culture, which became the subject of international media coverage after this year\u2019s mass murders in Parkland, Florida, and my hometown, Toronto, is an example of how young men can develop resentful, angry and self-victimizing masculine identities while having these identities reinforced by an online peer group.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Barack Obama greets attendees at a My Brother\u2019s Keeper Summit in Washington, in 2016. Photograph: Yuri Gripas/Reuters\n\nAs president, Barack Obama made it a priority to deliberately and strategically steer vulnerable young men away from the negative influences that affect fatherless kids. His initiative My Brother\u2019s Keeper (MBK) galvanized foundations, businesses, local governments and community groups to promote a milestones-based example for young men to follow, including reading at grade level by grade three, attending postsecondary education and staying out of the criminal justice system.\n\nMBK offered a way to identify healthy role models at different stages of a young man\u2019s life without being overly exclusive in defining who and what a man can be. MBK was renamed just before Obama left the White House and seems to have gone quiet as a federal government initiative. It continues as a non-governmental organization.\n\nMy search for role models wasn\u2019t as deliberate or strategic as Obama advocates for, but after years of trial and error I was able to find positive role models in community college and then university. In particular, professors showed me how learn to read and write effectively, built my self-esteem and encouraged me to find new peer groups. Professors also connected me with role models in books, such as Martin Luther King Jr, Malcolm X, Booker T Washington, Marcus Garvey and WEB Du Bois, who demonstrated the diversity of ways men can and do exist in the world. With the right support, not having a dad became an opportunity for me to choose positive inspirations.\n\nKnowing that others are fighting a legacy of fatherlessness in their own lives motivates me to continue believing\n\nA few weeks into my first semester at Yale law school, Jay-Z published his autobiography. It turned out he had transformed over the same period of time I had. In an interview about his book, he recalled the lyrics to one of his songs that I loved as a kid (Big Pimpin\u2019) and confessed: \u201cI can\u2019t believe I said that. And kept saying it. What kind of animal would say this sort of thing?\u201d\n\nToday, Jay-Z\u2019s example as a husband and father, detailed in last year\u2019s album 4:44, helps me when thinking about how to be a good partner to my girlfriend and a good father figure to her son, responsibilities for which I often feel deeply unprepared. Knowing that others are fighting a legacy of fatherlessness in their own lives motivates me to continue believing, trying and learning.\n\n\n\nFor those of us lucky enough to eventually see growing up without a dad as a positive opportunity, the challenge remains for us to help more fatherless kids find life\u2019s gifts and escape its curses."}

She was already cute, so I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing or what happened.\u201d\n\nNext: She looks completely different.\n\nShe\u2019s unrecognizable since her fall\n\nCarrie Underwood posed for a photo after her accident. | Carrie Underwood posed for a photo after her accident. | Adrienne Gang via Twitter\n\nSo how different will the star look next time we see her? Well, at least one person took a photo with her and didn\u2019t notice any change.\n\nIn fact, Below Deck alum Adrienne Gang thought Underwood looked \u201cgreat\u201d when she saw her working out in a gym at a resort. The Bravo star spoke to Us Weekly about their encounter on Dec. 12.\n\nI had no idea she got hurt prior to meeting her. She had a wrist brace on, but I didn\u2019t think much of it until I saw the headlines after I posted our picture together. She looked great and seemed to be in great spirits. I didn\u2019t notice anything amiss on her face. Simply, she looked lovely.\n\nNext: Ugly accusations against Mike Fisher\n\n\n\nFisher caused Underwood\u2019s fall\n\nThere\u2019s no reason to suspect this incident involved Fisher. | Michael Loccisano/Getty Images There\u2019s no reason to suspect this incident involved Fisher. | Michael Loccisano/Getty Images\n\nAnother vicious rumor that swirled about the couple after the songbird\u2019s fall is that Fisher pushed her down, causing her injury.\n\nBut those who are accusing her husband of domestic violence are ignoring the fact that he wasn\u2019t even home when Underwood fell. Therefore, he obviously didn\u2019t push her.\n\nFisher did fly home as soon as he heard about her accident and thanked all their fans for the well wishes and support while she recovered.\n\nNext: Is their marriage on the rocks?\n\n\n\nTheir marriage is in trouble, and they\u2019re living separate lives\n\nIs their marriage in any type of trouble? | Rick Diamond/Getty Images for J/P Haitian Relief Organization Is their marriage in any type of trouble? | Rick Diamond/Getty Images for J/P Haitian Relief Organization\n\nThere comes a time in almost every celebrity couple\u2019s relationship when, unfortunately, they have to deal with made up rumors that their marriage is in trouble.\n\nIn 2017, an unnamed source told a not-so-reliable site that the \u201cJesus Take the Wheel\u201d artist and hockey player\u2019s marriage was in \u201cperil.\u201d The source said they had grown apart and were having problems, even living separate lives. \u201cBetween their careers, Carrie and Mike are so busy that they\u2019re barely together \u2014 and unfortunately, their problems run much deeper than that,\u201d the source claimed.\n\nThere has never been any proof that this story was true or that this source knew what they were talking about. So we\u2019ll just call it what it is: a rumor.\n\nNext: Did Underwood force Fisher to retire?\n\nUnderwood wanted another baby and forced Fisher to retire\n\nDid she want to have another baby? | Jason Merritt/Getty Images for dcp Did she want to have another baby? | Jason Merritt/Getty Images for dcp\n\nIn 2017, Fisher retired from the NHL after spending 17 seasons in the league with Ottawa Senators and Nashville Predators. Soon after his decision was announced, reports claimed Underwood forced him to retire because she wanted to work on their marriage and try for baby No. 2.\n\nGossip Cop busted this rumor, pointing out the so-called source only had second-hand knowledge of this.:\u201dI heard that she had become really unhappy with the situation. Having Mike home will be one solution, and I believe she hopes that having another baby together will bring them even closer than when they first fell in love.\u201d\n\nThis story had no truth to it, especially because Fisher didn\u2019t stay retired long.\n\nNext: Is Underwood upset that Fisher came out of retirement?\n\n\n\nThe singer is unhappy with her husband\u2019s decision to return to ice\n\nIs she keeping him away from his career? | Bruce Bennett/Getty Images Is she keeping him away from his career? | Bruce Bennett/Getty Images\n\nIn 2018, Fisher came out of retirement and rejoined the Predators. So a tabloid used that story and spun it, claiming Underwood was upset about his decision to return to the league.\n\nHowever, the posts she put on Instagram when he decided to go back point to the contrary. The \u201cBefore He Cheats\u201d singer posted an image of a T-shirt with her hubby\u2019s face on it that reads, \u201cThe Fish is back!\u201d She also posted about how \u201cproud\u201d she is of him and hopes he can bring home the Stanley Cup.\n\nESPN even reported that it was Underwood who encouraged her man to return to the ice.\n\nNext: Are they splitting up?\n\n\n\nThe couple is getting a divorce\n\nShe confirmed they are doing just fine. | Ben Gabbe/Getty Images for TIME She confirmed they are doing just fine. | Ben Gabbe/Getty Images for TIME\n\nDivorce rumors popped up again in February 2018, and this time, Fisher set the record straight. After In Touch magazine reported they were going to end their marriage, the story gained legs when Fisher posted something to social media.\n\nThe NHL star posted a quote from Psalm 139:23-24 which read, \u201cSearch me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts. See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way of everlasting.\u201d\n\nA fan then posted they would be \u201cpraying\u201d for the couple and hoped they could get past their troubles. Fisher shut down the rumor right then and there by responding, writing, \u201cWe\u2019ve never been better.

{"label": false, "txt": "There was no shortage of celebrity beefs in 2017.\n\nWhether the fights were between co-stars or once close friends, the shade just kept coming. Let's take a look back at the most intense celebrity feuds of the year.\n\n1. Blac Chyna vs. Rob Kardashian\n\nBlac Chyna and Rob Kardashian's split turned a new level of nasty when the former couple exchanged wild accusations against one another in a heated, NSFW social media war in June. Kardashian shared graphic naked photos of Chyna, accused her of cheating on him multiple times and also accused her of being on drugs. Meanwhile, Chyna took to Snapchat to accuse Kardashian of also cheating on her and being physically abusive.\n\nOne month later, a judge granted Chyna's request for a temporary restraining order against Kardashian.\n\n\"Revenge porn is a form of domestic abuse,\" Chyna's attorney, Lisa Bloom, said during a press conference.\n\nGreg Doherty/Getty Images\n\nBut the two now appear to be keeping it amicable when it comes to their daughter, 1-year-old Dream. In September, the two reached a custody agreement.\n\n\"Chyna is pleased that Rob has agreed to peacefully co-parent Dream with her, as she has been requesting all along,\" Bloom said in a statement.\n\nKardashian\u2019s attorney, Robert Shapiro, also told ET at the time that \"Rob and Chyna are working together to put the best interest of their child first and have amicably resolved their personal matters.\"\n\nOf course, Chyna is still suing Kardashian, his mom Kris Jenner and sister Kim Kardashian West over the cancellation of E!\u2019s Rob & Chyna.\n\n2. Dwayne Johnson vs. Tyrese Gibson\n\nAlberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images\n\nThe drama between the Fast and Furious co-stars began in September, when Gibson left a comment on Johnson\u2019s Instagram post, asking him not to let a rumored spinoff film starring Johnson\u2019s character, Agent Hobbs, push back the planned release date of Fast 9.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m simply trying to reach him cause he won\u2019t call me back about this solo #HobbsMovie,\u201d Gibson wrote in the lengthy comment. \u201cI want you to shoot it just not right now cause the #Fast9 release date has already been announced.\u201d\n\nThe feud escalated one month later, when Gibson called out Johnson on Instagram, and slammed his critical and commercial flop, Baywatch.\n\n\n\nJohnson defended himself on Twitter.\n\n\"My goal from day 1 was to come in and create an exciting/fun character for the fans, elevate the franchise and build it out,\" he tweeted.\n\nGibson also took to Twitter, to call his co-star \"selfish.\"\n\n\"The real selfish #CandyA** revealed,\" Gibson wrote. \"And why you on Twitter?? You lost my number right? I'm at you when I see you #Family.\"\n\n\"You still promoting a movie that no one wants to see made you clown,\" he continued.\n\nOf course, Johnson didn't take the shady tweets lying down.\n\n\"Pumped to expand and build out the FAST & FURIOUS universe in a cool, exciting way,\" Johnson captioned yet another Instagram post, adding, \"Thank you UNIVERSAL STUDIOS for being tremendous partners who see the big picture and for coming to us years ago with this spinoff idea.\"\n\n\n\n\"I have a tremendous amount of respect for this franchise that I\u2019ve enjoyed droppin\u2019 blood and sweat in over the years,\" he continued. \"And my vision is to create greater opportunities for not only my fellow FF cast mates, but for other amazing actors as well who want to be a part of something new and cool.The more opportunities we can create the better for the fans. Smart business,\" he argued. \"Let\u2019s have some FUN and to quote, Hobbs the boss, if you don\u2019t like it, we\u2019re happy to beat that a** like a Cherokee drum. #CandyA**esNeedNotApply.\"\n\nAlthough Gibson Instagrammed in November that he was out of the Fast and the Furious franchise if Johnson was in, he later claimed he was \"never mad\" at Johnson .... though continued to slam him.\n\n\"So the Rock how does it feel bro?.... going home to your daughter every night,\" he asked, referencing his highly publicized custody battle over daughter Shayla. \"It was 60 days before I seen my baby..... and all I asked you to do 'privately' was NOT accept a role that would deeply affect us all....... You are simply NOT the people\u2019s champ..... you are a selfish champ.\"\n\n3. Kanye West vs. JAY-Z\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe two close friends and collaborators' falling out continued this year, after West publicly called JAY-Z out during an onstage concert rant last November.\n\n\"You got hurt, because this guy was talking about you on a stage,\" JAY-Z commented in August during an interview with Elliott Wilson and Brian \"B.Dot\" Miller on the Rap Radar podcast. \"But what really hurt me, you can't bring my kid or my wife into it. Like, Kanye is my little brother. He's talked about me a hundred times. He even made a song called \u2018Big Brother.' We've gotten past bigger issues, but you brought my family into it, now it's a problem.\"\n\nIn July, West reportedly left JAY-Z\u2019s Tidal over a money dispute.\n\nHowever, there is hope for those wishing for a Watch the Throne part two. During a Q&A with New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet for T: The New York Times Style Magazine in November, JAY-Z had a few conciliatory words for West, whom he still referred to as his \"brother.\"\n\n\"I [talked to] Kanye the other day, just to tell him, like, he's my brother,\" he recalled. \"I love Kanye. I do. It's a complicated relationship with us.\"\n\nStill, JAY-Z admitted that there's currently tension between the two.\n\n\"But that happens,\" he stressed. \"In the long relationship, you know, hopefully when we're 89 we look at this six months or whatever time and we laugh at that. There's gonna be complications in the relationship that we have to get through. And the only way to get through that is we sit down and have a dialogue and say, 'These are the things that I'm uncomfortable with. These are the things that are unacceptable to me. This is what I feel.' I'm sure he feels that I've done things to him as well. I'm not a perfect human being by no stretch.\"\n\n\"[West is] a very compassionate person,\" he added. And a lot of times he get in trouble trying to help others, So, I can identify with it. It's just that there's certain things that happened that's not really acceptable to me. ... And we just need to speak about it. But there's genuine love there.\"\n\n4. Camila Cabello vs. Fifth Harmony\n\nGetty Images\n\nThings turned messy between girl group Fifth Harmony and Camila Cabello pretty quickly after she announced she was leaving the group last December, and the remaining members -- Lauren Jauregui, Ally Brooke, Normani Kordei and Dinah Jane -- claimed in a statement that they only learned of her departure through her representatives.\n\nIn an interview with Billboard in February, Cabello talked about the \u201cintense\u201d split and admitted she hadn\u2019t spoken to her former bandmates.\n\n\"I was always super open [that] I couldn\u2019t just sing other people\u2019s words and be totally happy with that,\" Cabello said of exiting the group. \"You have to follow and honor that inner voice. I always encouraged the girls to do the same.\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t want to get into the details of that, because it was really intense and it\u2019s hard for me to talk about,\" she added about not keeping in touch. \"It makes me sad.\"\n\nIn their own Billboard interview in July, Fifth Harmony wasn\u2019t shy about alluding to the bad blood.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say we\u2019re in a better place now -- there are no secrets in this circle,\u201d Jane said of Cabello's exit.\n\nHowever, the shadiest moment definitely happened at the MTV Video Music Awards in August, when before their performance of \"Angel\" and \"Down,\" a a fifth member of the group -- presumably meant to represent Cabello -- fell backwards off the stage.\n\nThe group later denied they were slamming Cabello during an interview with Good Morning America.\n\n\u201cWe get asked all the time if we\u2019re getting a fifth member,\u201d Brooke explained. \u201cAnd we wanted to show the world in an artistic way that, \u2018Hey, the four of us are Fifth Harmony. We are stronger and better than we\u2019ve ever been.\"\n\n5. Kim Cattrall vs. Sex and the City Cast\n\nNew Line Cinema\n\nRumors have floated around for some time now that Kim Cattrall didn't get along with her Sex and the City cast members, and they were pretty much confirmed this year, after Sarah Jessica Parker announced that there would be no Sex and the City 3 film.\n\n\"It's over... we're not doing it,\" she told Extra. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed. We had this beautiful, funny, heartbreaking, joyful, very relatable script and story. It\u2019s not just disappointing that we don\u2019t get to tell the story and have that experience, but more so for that audience that has been so vocal in wanting another movie.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Mail later reported that it was Cattrall's \"demands\" that put a stop to the project, claiming she insisted that Warner Bros. produce other movies she had in development before signing onto SATC 3. Cattrall denied the report on Twitter.\n\nWoke 2 a @MailOnline \ud83d\udca9storm! The only 'DEMAND' I ever made was that I didn't want to do a 3rd film....& that was back in 2016 \u2014 Kim Cattrall (@KimCattrall) September 29, 2017\n\nCattrall then specifically called out Parker during an interview with Piers Morgan for ITV's Life Stories.\n\n\"At this very moment, it\u2019s quite extraordinary to get any kind of negative press about something that I\u2019ve been saying for almost a year,\" she noted. \"This is really where I take to task the people from Sex and the City, specifically Sarah Jessica Parker, in that I think she could have been nicer,\" she expressed to Morgan. \"I really think she could have been nicer.\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t know what her issue is, I never have,\" she added.\n\nCattrall also said she was never friends with her SATC co-stars, including Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis.\n\n\"We\u2018ve been colleagues and in some ways, it\u2019s a very healthy place to be because then you have a clear line between your professional life and relationship and your personal,\" she noted. \"They all have children and I am 10 years older, and since, specifically, the series ended, I have been spending most of my time outside of New York, so, I don\u2019t see them. The common ground that we had was the series, and the series is over.\"\n\nThough she did admit that she wishes her co-stars would try harder to keep in touch, after sharing that she couldn't even recall the last time she had spoken to them.\n\n\"That\u2019s another thing that\u2019s really disappointing, is that nobody ever picks up the phone and tries to contact you and say, \u2018How you doing?\u2019\" she shared.\n\n\u2026. And it appears the cast is taking sides. Willie Garson -- who portrayed Stanford Blatch, the best friend of Carrie Bradshaw (Parker) in both the TV series and the movies -- posted a cryptic tweet in October that appeared to be aimed at Cattrall. Cattrall repeatedly denied that she ever considered doing a third SATC movie and further claimed that she never began contract negotiations.\n\n\"Dear fans, because I'm \"toxic,\" I'm going to negotiate a contract for 6 months, not come to terms, then say I never wanted to do it anyway,'\" he wrote.\n\nDear fans, because I'm \"toxic\", I'm going to negotiate a contract for 6 months, not come to terms, then say I never wanted to do it anyway. \u2014 Willie Garson (@WillieGarson) October 4, 2017\n\n6. Katy Perry vs. Taylor Swift\n\n\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe epic Katy Perry vs. Taylor Swift feud continued with the promotion of both their respective albums this year -- Perry's Witness and Swift's Reputation. Perry didn't hold back during her Carpool Karaoke segment with James Corden in June, addressing the beef head-on.\n\n\"Honestly, it's really like she started it and it's time for her to finish it,\" Perry said after the Late Late Show host asked her to clear things up. \"She wouldn't speak to me. I do the right thing any time that it feels like a fumble. It was a full shutdown and then she writes a song about me and I'm like, 'OK, cool, cool, cool. That's how you wanna deal with it?'\"\n\nIn an interview with NME, Perry gave background on why she decided to address the feud with Corden.\n\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019m not Buddha -- things irritate me,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish that I could turn the other cheek every single time, but I\u2019m also not a pushover, you know? Especially when someone tries to assassinate my character with little girls [her fans]. That\u2019s so messed up!\u201d\n\nThough Swift stayed silent on Perry's comments about her, she let her actions do the talking. Swift surprisingly announced on June 8 that her entire catalog will return to all streaming services at midnight -- just when Perry's Witness dropped.\n\nSwift also took thinly veiled digs at Perry in her \"Look What You Made Me Do\" music video that dropped in August. Swift dresses up very similar to Perry in the shade-filled video and gets into a car crash -- a moment that looks very close to the accident in Perry's \"Unconditionally\" music video. She also pointedly holds a GRAMMY, highlighting that she has 10 accolades, while Perry has zero.\n\nLater, Swift is in a vault, robbing a bank and wearing a sweatshirt that features a glittery tiger, along with a cat mask, seemingly mocking the name of Perry's fanbase, KatyCats.\n\nYouTube\n\n7. Caitlyn Jenner vs. The Kardashians\n\nGetty Images\n\nCaitlyn Jenner's relationship with the Kardashian family deteriorated after the August release of her memoir, The Secret of My Life, which didn't exactly paint the Kardashians in a positive light. Kris Jenner claimed on Keeping Up With the Kardashians that Caitlyn's stories about her were \"all made up.\"\n\n\"My mom has been so fair to Cait, and Cait just has no decency towards my mom whatsoever,\" Kim Kardashian West later told KUWTK cameras, clearly siding with her mother. \"I feel like my mom is carrying this burden and feeling like she had to maintain a relationship with Caitlyn for all the kids. But we're grown up. I don't think my mom has to try anymore. It's time to move on.\"\n\nIn September, Caitlyn said she hadn't spoken to Kris or Kim since the book's release.\n\n\u201cI went overboard to be nice, to be friendly, to be open, but also tell my story and my side of the story,\u201d Caitlyn said during an appearance on Good Morning Britain. \u201cSince the book came out, I\u2019ve never talked to Kris again. Kim, I haven\u2019t talked to in six, nine months, whatever it is.\u201d\n\n\"It\u2019s unfortunate, because actually Kim was the first one I talked to about this issue,\u201d she continued. \"She was very straightforward with me. She\u2019s been very, very good on it. It\u2019s a big loss in my life, not having her there anymore. To me, I mean, that\u2019s sad.\"\n\nCurrently, the relationship is showing no signs of repair.\n\nThe I Am Cait star spoke to students at Cambridge Union in England in November, where amid discussing her 2015 transition and its aftermath, she revealed that she and Kim haven't spoken in \"a year.\"\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a little bit tough over the last couple of years on the Kardashian side,\" Caitlyn acknowledged. \"To be honest, I don't talk to them anymore. Kim, I haven't talked to in a year.\"\n\n\"They don't want me in their lives, they bashed me pretty badly,\" she continued. \"It's devastating when your kids do that. It really hurt.\"\n\n8. Drake Bell vs. Josh Peck\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe state of the Drake & Josh co-stars' friendship made headlines in June, when Bell made it clear he was upset that he wasn't invited to Peck's wedding to Paige O'Brien. Although Bell wasn't present at the ceremony, Peck's Grandfathered co-star, John Stamos, was, as well as Jason Nash, whom Peck also acted with on Drake & Josh.\n\nIn now deleted tweets, Bell made his feelings known.\n\n\"When you're not invited to the wedding the message is clear\u2026\" Bell tweeted. \"Loyalty is key\u2026 ALWAYS remember where you came from.\"\n\n\"True colors have come out today,\" he added. \"Message is loud and clear. Ties are officially cut. I'll miss ya brotha.\"\n\nFor his part, Peck made it clear that he no longer had a close relationship with Bell during his appearance on the Allegedly with Theo Von & Matthew Cole Weiss podcast.\n\nET spoke to Bell in July, when he explained the emotional tweets.\n\n\"We've been together 18 years, Josh and me, me and Josh,\" Bell shared. \"We've been so close, it was just one of those things where, you know, I'd been talking to him, and he's been telling me about the engagement. And then I saw on social media, the wedding, and I didn't hear about it. So, it was just one of those things where it was just like, 'You didn't even tell me?! I had to find out on social media?' And then you're like, 'You know what!? Fine!' and then I'm like, wait, I probably shouldn't have done that.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I said the ties are cut or whatever, but I should have just texted that to him, you know,\" he continued. \"I was just being cranky.\"\n\nTo solidify that the two had no hard feelings, they later reunited at the MTV VMAs in August.\n\n9. Justin Bieber vs. Marilyn Manson\n\n\n\nMatt Winkelmeyer, Kevin Mazur/Getty Images\n\nOne of the most bizarre feuds of the year was between pop star Justin Bieber and goth rocker Marilyn Manson. During an interview with Billboard in September, Manson said he confronted Bieber at a bar when he saw that the \"Sorry\" singer was selling shirts with Manson's face on the front and Bieber's name on the back, as part of his official Purpose World Tour merchandise.\n\n\"I saw a little girl in a pink hoodie with blond hair, and it turns out to be Bieber. I sit down, and I say, 'Hey, so you wore my shirt and everything onstage,'\" Manson recalled. \"He was one of those touchy people that hit you when they talk, and he comes up to about d**k height. Then he goes, 'I made you relevant again.'\"\n\nManson said he got revenge by not showing up to a planned duet between the two at Bieber\u2019s show that he suggested.\n\n\"I reply, 'That was a great idea you had about doing [my song] 'The Beautiful People' at your show at Staples Center tomorrow.' And he goes, 'Yeah, it was,' not knowing that I told him an idea that I had just made up,\" Manson shared. \"His tour manager sat down, and I asked, 'What time is sound check tomorrow? What time should I be there? Because we\u2019re going to do 'Beautiful People.\u2019 Obviously, when 4 p.m. rolled around the next day, I just didn't show.\"\n\nManson later claimed Bieber apologized to him through text during Manson\u2019s appearance on Howard Stern's Sirius XM show.\n\nQuoting Bieber\u2019s supposed texts, Manson read, \u201cHonestly, I totally thought we hit it off. My bad. If I was an a**hole, it wasn't my intention.\u201d\n\n\"I don't really care about the media,\" Manson continued to read from Bieber's supposed texts. \"I just wanna make sure you and I were good. \u2018Cause I like you.\"\n\nManson further reflected on their feud.\n\n\"He sassed me and he apologized,\" Manson explained. \"And I said I wouldn't s**t talk him, so I wouldn't s**t talk him.\"\n\n"}
{"label": false, "txt": "Come December, it's become near tradition over the past few years for everyone to complain about how the previous 12 months have been the worst ever. This year, however really, really feels like it. This year has been a barrage of bizarre and bummer headlines that at times it's felt like some dystopian nightmare.\n\nIt's been so bad that the Kardashian-West clan have just decided to end 2016 early. Yes, Kim and Kanye have decided to cancel all public and professional commitments for the end of the year and plan to maintain their social media blackouts as well. To be exact, a flack told Page Six that Kim and Kanye \u201cplan on taking the rest of 2016 off and spending time as a family.\"\n\nWhich, frankly, we wish we all could do, don't we?\n\nIs it possible for President Obama's last major act to be an executive decree for us to just all get a chance to chill out and recuperate for the remaining 26 days left in this bummer of a year? Sure, there's no political safeguarding against any potential additional music legends from dying or preventing any further tragedies and disasters from happening or ensuring that some new odd Zika-like disease pops up, but there's got to be something? How about the \"Netflix and Chill Act?\" Just an order that all Americans get to spend the next month relaxing and catching up on any television series they may have missed this year.\n\nOf course, when it comes to Kim and Kanye it's understandable that they've decided to literally cancel the rest of their 2016. Kim was still in the midst of recuperating from being robbed at gunpoint in Paris when her husband Kanye was hospitalized following a very public breakdown.\n\nThey've had to endure these private tragedies while also dealing with immense public interest and rumors running rampant in the tabloid press.\n\nE!, the home of the Kardashian's reality TV empire, reports that a family source says \"Kim is doing okay despite reports.\"\n\n\"She has many things on her plate so being overwhelmed is expected,\" the source continued. \"She wants to get Kanye back on his feet. She is not leaving him. She loves him.\"\n\nKanye was released from an L.A.-area hospital last week after spending more than a week receiving treatment for exhaustion. Kim West was reportedly by his side throughout the entire ordeal and now wants to make sure Kanye continues to receive therapy and treatment now that he's out of the hospital.\n\nDespite your personal opinion on the pair, it certainly does seem like the family deserves the rest. In addition to their dual ordeal, they also have two young children to care for after all (in fact, today is Saint West's first birthday). Maybe it's best we all let them lay low and chill for the next month or so.\n\nUnfortunately, we all don't have the luxury as much as we wish we could. Then again, it's not looking like 2017 is shaping up to be any better. Hopefully, a rested and healthier Kim and Kanye can get back into form and provide us with the not-quite-as-tragic-as-this distractions we'll probably desperately need in the new year.\n\nUpdate: Kanye, for one, has now reappeared in public, albeit in a very low-key way. He was spotted with newly blond hair at designer Rick Owens' furniture show in Los Angeles ."}

{"label": false, "txt": "\u00a9 Gossip Cop (Getty Images) Justin Theroux is not pursuing Emma Stone following his split from Jennifer Aniston, despite a completely untrue tabloid report. Gossip Cop can exclusively debunk this nonsense. We\u2019re told it\u2019s false.\n\nTheroux sat next to Stone at Louis Vuitton\u2019s Paris Fashion Week show earlier this month, which has prompted NW to create a nonexistent romance between the two. An alleged insider tells the magazine, \u201cJustin seemed very into Emma. He kept leaning over to talk to her. It was obvious that he was flirting with her.\u201d\n\nAccording to the questionable source, Aniston became very upset when she learned her estranged husband supposedly \u201ccozied up\u201d to Stone at the show. \u201cShe thought he was more respectful than that,\u201d a so-called \u201cfriend\u201d of the actress tells the outlet. \u201cIt really hurts.\u201d The supposed tipster goes on to say that Aniston has nothing to worry about because \u201cEmma would never\u201d betray her, but the situation still stings.\n\nGossip Cop, however, is told by a source close to the situation that the tabloid\u2019s account of events is simply \u201cnot true.\u201d Theroux wasn\u2019t flirting with Stone at the fashion show, nor is her pursuing her romantically. The two are just friendly, having recently worked together on the upcoming Netflix series \u201cManiac.\u201d Also, the co-stars didn\u2019t attend the fashion show together. They were sitting in the celebrity ambassador section along with guests such as Michelle Williams, Jennifer Connelly and several fashion executives. Additionally, Stone is currently dating \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d writer Dave McCary.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, NW has an ongoing narrative about Aniston\u2019s estranged husband chasing other famous women following their breakup. Gossip Cop recently busted the publication for falsely claiming Theroux was \u201chitting on\u201d Selena Gomez. Shortly before that nonsense, we called out the magazine for ridiculously alleging the actor was getting close to Angelina Jolie.\n\nIn the short time since Theroux and Aniston separated, the actor has also been wrongly linked to photographer Petra Collins and fashion designer Alexa Chung. Oddly enough, this also isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve had to debunk an article linking Stone to one of her \u201cManiac\u201d co-stars. Gossip Cop recently corrected a bogus story about the actress wanting to date the show\u2019s leading man, Jonah Hill. This latest article surrounding Theroux and Stone is more fiction.\n\nRelated slideshow: Debunking the week's tabloid stories:"}

They split two years later after she landed her role in Suits, which filmed in Toronto. Previously it was thought the pair grew apart after Meghan spent months filming in Canada and her beau was based in LA.\n\nNinaki says otherwise.\n\n(Image: Getty Images North America)\n\n(Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\n\"The way she handled it, Trevor definitely had the rug pulled out from under him. He was hurt,\" she said, explaining that while Trevor was heartbroken, Meghan was less affected,\" she told Mail Online.\n\nPrior to their split, Ninaki - who was maid of honour at the wedding - said the pair doted on each other and Trevor would have done anything for the actress.\n\n\"Then, after the wedding, it was like a light switched off. There\u2019s Meghan before fame and Meghan after fame. After three seasons of Suits, she called me to say the marriage was over.\n\nThe pair first met aged two at Hollywood\u2019s private Little Red School House before they went to the Immaculate Heart girls\u2019 high school in Los Angeles at the age of 11.\n\nFollowing a close friendship that she describes as 'sisterly', Ninaki says the pair eventually fell out over how Meghan and ex-husband - who the ex Suits star met when she was just 23 - split.\n\nShe explains she went to visit Trevor who was heartbroken over their split, while Meghan seemed less affected.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nElsewhere, Ninaki said her former best friend, who quit Suits to pursue a life with Harry, always wanted to be famous.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"She just loved to be the centre of attention,\" she went on. \"We used to imagine her receiving an Oscar. She used to practise announcing herself.\"\n\nWhile talking about her relationship with Harry and her role as a future royal, Ninaki claims Meghan was always very aware of the Royal Family - despite the actress claiming she knew little about Harry when they met.\n\n\"I think it\u2019s a very fanciful dream to believe that you just walk into a Prince Charming.\n\n\"I know the Royal Family was something she found fascinating. She had one of Princess Diana\u2019s books [Diana: Her True Story] on her bookshelf, and even when she was with Trevor she told me she wanted to go and stay in London for at least a month.\"\n\nShe added: \"I wasn\u2019t shocked or even surprised to hear about Prince Harry. I know she used to love The Princess Diaries \u2014 films about a commoner who becomes part of a Royal Family. She was very taken with that idea.\""}
{"label": false, "txt": "A white witch from North London has urged Hollywood star Angelina Jolie to cease dabbling in magic to try to woo back ex-husband Brad Pitt.\n\nBack in September, Star magazine reported that Angelina was 'turning to bizarre spiritual rituals in an effort to fix her life and get Brad back', but Carrie Kirkpatrick, 51, says she knew that what the actress was doing was very wrong.\n\n'When you use spells to try and win someone back, you have to be very careful what you wish for,' Carrie told FEMAIL. 'Brad and Angelina split up for a reason, so if she succeeds in getting back with him, she may end up unhappy.\n\n'She is making a foolish mistake if she thinks she can manipulate him back into her life using magic. He has free will. If they are meant to be together, then love and their highest selves will find a way.'\n\nCarrie, who is ordained as a Priestess Of the Goddess and teaches people how to connect with the 'mystical goddess energies', also noted how Angelina and Brad had a mutual tattooing session last year, months before their union ended,\n\nIt was a symbolic effort to 'bind their marriage', but it failed because she was 'forcing' them to stay together, she said.\n\nWhite witch Carrie Kirkpatrick, 51, from London has cautioned Angelina Jolie not to try to manipulate Brad Pitt into coming back to her through the power of magic\n\nReports suggest that that Angelina has been 'turning to bizarre spiritual rituals in an effort to fix her life and get Brad back' following her split from Brad last year\n\nThe actress flew her tattooist to Cambodia to do a new inking that would spiritually bind her marriage to Brad, but months later they split up\n\nCarrie says Angelina has always been interested in the 'dark arts'.\n\n'The way she used to wear her ex-husband Billy Bob Thornton's blood in a vial around her neck, this is a form of blood magic,' she explained.\n\n'It feeds into her tendencies towards BDSM. For her, obsession and possession equal love.'\n\n'Angelina is known to have a strong interest in the occult, especially Voodoo and Hoodoo.\n\nHATHOR\u2019S MIRROR: A LOVE SPELL FOR HALLOWEEN Carrie has shared a spell for those looking for love at Halloween, but advises that anyone who uses it must have pure intentions. Trying to control someone else\u2019s will, as she believes Angelina is doing with her magic, won\u2019t work. 'When a person works magic to \"keep\" or \"get\" a particular love interest, it may work, but only for a short period of time,' she said. Tools: Pink/red candle, candlestick, rose/jasmine oil, handheld mirror. Egyptian/inspiring music. Jasmine incense Light the incense, turn down the lights and play the music softly. Anoint the candle with rose or jasmine oil and, focusing on the candle, call upon the Goddess, saying: 'Great Goddess Hathor, Goddess of Love, of Beauty and Joy, I ask that you be here present this night, that I may voice my true desire for a lover in my life who will lift my heart with passionate joy. May they be guided to my side that we may share a love so true. May our hearts sing with joy in honour of you. Guide me to be in the right place at the right time to meet my heart\u2019s desire, and that they be ready and willing to love me with a passion equal to mine. Show me my new love, O Goddess divine.' Now light the candle and place it in the candlestick on a table and say: 'So mote it be!' Then take the handheld mirror and gaze into it. Allow your eyes to lose their focus and, as you look at your reflection, see if another face appears before you. Who is it? Is it someone you already know? Perhaps you will see yourself in a particular situation, look at where you are, taking note of the details. How do you appear? Who else is there? This may be where you meet your lover. When you feel ready, re-focus your eyes and bring your awareness back into the room. Thank Hathor for gifting you the vision and say: 'Hail and farewell.' Then let the candle burn all the way down.\n\n'Whilst these traditions are not necessarily dark, there is the option here to use the magic for a darker purpose.\n\n'In all magic, the choice between working the spell for good or bad is really down to the intention of the practitioner.\n\n'It's like opening a very potent toolbox, you can use the tools however you wish, but there will be consequences.\n\n'This is why we recommend proper training in magical practice. It's to protect the practitioner as well as the subjects of their magic,' said Carrie.\n\nAngelina is also a devotee of tattoos and before she split from Brad, the couple were inked alongside one another by ex Thai monk Ajarn Noo Kanpai, who they flew to Siem Reap in Cambodia in February 2016 to work on the symbolic designs.\n\nShe acquired three new mystical sak yant back inkings from the Thai artist, a style which encompasses lines of script, geometric patterns and animal shapes, while Brad had the left side of his stomach tattooed with a Buddhist symbol.\n\nThe process was meant to 'symbolically bind them as husband and wife', but they ended up splitting in September 2016.\n\nCarrie said: 'This is a classic case of the magic rebounding, as she was trying to force them to stay together.\n\n'She uses her tattoos as protective talismans but they are not linked to witchcraft.\n\n'They're magical though, in that she associates them with protective qualities. So she is using the magic of the Far East. This is not witchcraft as we on the West know it - it's the \"magic\" of another culture.'\n\nThe star also reportedly used magic to woo her man, by presenting him with a vial of grey powder that turned out to be a cremated bat, purportedly to ward off negative energies and accidents.\n\n'It's more likely that this was intended to bind him to her,' Carried explained.\n\n'She comes across as a bit insecure so she may have felt that she needed the magic to seal the deal and prevent any other witches or occultists from attacking her or sabotaging her love life.\n\nIt's all about the sex with Angelina, and by that I mean the power she can exert over a man. This is like an elixir, the ultimate possession.\n\n'She clearly wanted Brad very much and would not consider letting him go. But ultimately, this is a fool's game as there's no point in trying to make someone be with you.\n\nCARRIE'S LIFE AS A WITCH Seeing Carrie doing the weekly shop with her 11-year-old son, you'd be forgiven for thinking she's just like all the other mums. But she isn't the same at all \u2013 not by a long stretch. As a lonely, only child, Carrie always felt 'different'. She remembers being able to read people's minds but she'd get scolded for it. 'I knew I had special talents but I pushed them away,' she recalled. 'I didn't want people to think I was a weirdo! So I just kept quiet and decided a life as a psychic wasn't for me.' Growing up, Carrie always felt different and could read people's thoughts but she kept her abilities hidden for fear of being judged Fate, though, seemed to have other ideas. As the young Carrie grew up, she tried to ignore that part of herself and it wasn't until she was an adult that she found herself drawn back towards the world of the supernatural. 'I realised it always destined to be part of my life. So I started doing readings for people, never thinking it would take off. The white witch specialises in helping the lovelorn 'But it did and, amazingly, I've been working as a professional psychic clairvoyant now for over 30 years.' Every morning at home, Carrie makes a point of grounding herself and giving thanks to the Goddesses for all that she has. 'I am lucky to live surrounded by woods and I have four cats. It's really important to connect with the cycle of nature and acknowledge the season. This is what magic is all about.' She also performs daily cleansing rituals, using sage and essential oils. 'A lot of people visit my house,' she says, 'so it's important that I clear away all the energies that belong to others.' Find out more at www.carriekirkpatrick.com\n\n'They have free will and entrapping them will only lead to unhappiness. Why would anyone want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with them?'\n\nAssisting the lovelorn is one of Carrie's many talents. 'I've helped all kinds of people using magic,' she says. 'People with legal issues, love troubles, fears and insecurities.\n\n'I guide them through transformation in their lives, by showing them how to face their fears and follow their true path.'\n\nCarrie cautions again using love spells on anyone who you are certain doesn't want to be in your life\n\nWhen working with people who've come to her, Carrie has found that some are \u2013 or have been \u2013 witches.\n\n'I believe that many people are born witches, and that they have been witches, healers and psychics in previous lives. These people often bring with them a fear of persecution due to the history of so many witches being executed,' she claims.\n\n'When working with them, it's important for me to help them heal past life trauma so that they can be themselves in this life and do the work that they're destined to do."}

Rapper Mac Miller, Ariana\u2019s boyfriend, was there to greet the pop star and her mother when they landed.\n\nWe\u2019re not sure why The Daily Mail would include a mention of Taylor Swift in the story since it\u2019s not at all relevant to anything else about the bombing at Ariana Grande\u2019s concert.\n\nAccording to The Telegraph, the suicide bombing at the Manchester Arena was carried out by a man named Salman Abedi. The attack killed 22 people, the youngest of whom was an eight-year-old girl. Dozens of concert goers were injured.\n\nThe bomb, which was packed with nuts and bolts, went off just moments after Ariana finished the last song in her set. ISIS has since taken credit for the carnage.\n\nIn the aftermath of the bombing, British Prime Minister, Theresa May, increased the terrorist threat level in the UK from severe to critical. She also said that there will be an increased military presence at public events.\n\nAbedi was 22 years old and of Libya descent. He was born in Manchester and studied business at Salisbury college. However, he did not complete his degree. The Telegraph reports that he was the youngest of four children whose parents fled Libya during Colonel Moammar Gaddafi\u2019s regime. According to a family friend he was in Libya a couple of weeks ago. Another friend said that he was a \u201cfriendly\u201d guy.\n\n\u201cHe was always friendly, nothing to suggest (he was violent).

This time around Adam Levine, Alicia Keys, Blake Shelton, and Gwen Stefani are the show\u2019s coaches. Gwen\u2019s return as a coach should be interesting now that she and Blake are further into their relationship. There are reports that this has had an effect on their contracts with The Voice and what the couple is planning next for their relationship.\n\nCurious about what\u2019s going on between them? Here are 10 things we know about their relationship.\n\n1. They have recently released music about their divorces\n\nMiranda Lambert and Blake Shelton attend the BMI 2014 Country Awards. | Rick Diamond/Getty Images Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton attend the BMI 2014 Country Awards. | Rick Diamond/Getty Images\n\nGwen and Blake were both recently divorced when they got together. Blake got a divorce from Miranda Lambert. And his new album, If I\u2019m Honest, purposely starts off with a party song and then goes into sadder music, a transition that reflects his personal life. \u201cThat\u2019s when it became painfully obvious that it wasn\u2019t going to work out in my \u00admarriage,\u201d he told Billboard. Although the singer has made a new album about the end of the relationship, there is still mystery surrounding what caused the divorce.\n\nGwen had a messy divorce from Gavin Rossdale after she reportedly found out he cheated. She came out with a new album that includes a single titled, \u201cUsed To Love You.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was really a life-saver record for me,\u201d she told Time. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until I had to go through the worst tragedy that it really opened up a channel for me to be like, \u2018God gave me a gift. I\u2019m going to use it now. Because if I don\u2019t, I\u2019m going to die.'\u201d\n\n2.

Then, Blake decided to announce his divorce.\n\n\u201cWe were all mic-ed up and everything, and Blake\u2019s like, \u2018I gotta talk to you guys.\u2019 And he basically made his announcement,\u201d Gwen told Howard Stern. \u201cHe basically told me what was going on with him. We just started this friendship. I wasn\u2019t trying to start a relationship. I was just trying to not die. There was no plan. It was an incredible gift to be able to have a friend.\u201d\n\n3. Gwen had no clue who Blake was before going on the show\n\nBlake Shelton and Gwen Stefani on The Voice | NBC Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani on The Voice | NBC\n\nThis is probably the case for many fans of The Voice who aren\u2019t country music lovers.

I had no idea.\u201d She also had no clue what he sounded like.\n\nHe sent me this song in an email, and I was so scared because at that point I really didn\u2019t know even what his voice really sounded like. Like, I\u2019d heard it on the show, but I wasn\u2019t paying attention. I was like, \u2018Whatever, country guy\u2019s on. When\u2019s Pharrell coming on?\u2019\n\n4. They didn\u2019t confirm they were dating until November 2015\n\nGwen Stefani and Blake Shelton on The Voice | NBC Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton on The Voice | NBC\n\nIn the beginning, there were rumors the two were dating, but they still kept it secret. Still, it was badly kept because there were photos of them getting cozy together at a Halloween party. Finally, in November, Blake\u2019s rep confirmed they were dating to E! News.\n\n\n\n5. Gwen and Blake are actually working like a team this season\n\nGwen Stefani and Blake Shelton on The Voice | NBC Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton on The Voice | NBC\n\nIt seemed unclear whether the couple\u2019s romantic relationship would make them more competitive with each other or whether they would work together. It looks like the latter will be happening.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be driving home at night, and I\u2019ll be like, \u2018Do you think I should put these two people against each other?\u2019 and he\u2019ll be like, \u2018Yeah, yeah, yeah,'\u201d Gwen revealed to ET. \u201cI was like, \u2018I don\u2019t believe you! I think you\u2019re trying to trick me right now!'\u201d\n\n6.

But they do have a breakup clause in their contracts\n\nGwen Stefani on The Voice | NBC Gwen Stefani on The Voice | NBC\n\nOf course there is a risk this plan could backfire. Instead of the couple being cute on screen, they could end up breaking up and might not want to work with each other. Well, the producers have a safety net in place in case of a break-up.\n\n\u201cAnd, of course, there is a stipulation in their contract, which is more of a break-up clause,\u201d the production source told Radar Online. \u201cIf, for some reason, they call it quits, they are both required to finish out the remainder of their existing contracts.\u201d\n\n8.

{"label": false, "txt": "It\u2019s apparently over between Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani, according to the latest round of rumors. Shelton supposedly broke up with Stefani last month but the No Doubt singer is still clinging on to hope that they will get back together.\n\nBlake reportedly broke up with Gwen in February right before he went on tour, according to In Touch Weekly. The celebrity gossip magazine claims that a source close to the couple told them that Stefani is not taking the breakup too well.\n\n\u201cGwen doesn\u2019t know what hit her,\u201d said the source. \u201cShe\u2019s heartbroken.\u201d\n\nJealousy has apparently gotten the better of Gwen as Blake has had enough of her \u201cneediness and all the drama,\u201d which forced him to dump her, according to the source.\n\nRumor has it that Gwen is not too happy with the closeness between her boyfriend of two years and The Voice Season 13 winner Chloe Kohanski. Previous rumors say Blake and Chloe have developed a bond deeper than a student-teacher relationship, reported the Hollywood Gossip. This allegedly led Gwen to be suspicious of the two.\n\n\u201cShe told him she didn\u2019t want to spend her life in fear of her famous partner cheating on her,\u201d the source said.\n\nHowever, Gossip Cop has since debunked the rumor that Shelton and Stefani have been fighting because of the 24-year-old Kohanski.\n\n@blakeshelton #countrymusicfreakstour gx A post shared by Gwen Stefani (@gwenstefani) on Mar 14, 2018 at 3:28pm PDT\n\nThe supposed constant effort to reassure Gwen has taken a toll on Blake and now the county music superstar has reportedly told her that he\u2019ll go through with the \u201clatter part of the monthlong Country Freaks Tour without her.\u201d\n\nThe insider said Gwen was caught by surprise.\n\n\u201cGwen was so used to accompanying him on tour, she was upended,\u201d the source said. \u201cAfter their nastiest argument ever, Blake took off without even saying goodbye. It was a real breaking point in the relationship.\u201d\n\nAside from the rumored jealousy issues, Blake is also allegedly fed up with Gwen\u2019s \u201cdemanding, critical ex-husband.\u201d Stefani has been co-parenting her three sons with former husband and Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale. The two divorced after 13 years of marriage because of Rossdale cheating on Stefani.\n\nAfter the divorce, Gwen developed a friendly relationship with Blake while both were judges on The Voice. Their friendship eventually grew into a romantic relationship and the two has been together since unless, of course, the recent breakup rumor is true.\n\nTo make matters worse, the insider told In Touch Weekly that Blake has been getting some much-needed support from his ex-wife. Miranda Lambert is rumored to have recently split with Anderson East, which In Touch Weekly also reported a few days ago.\n\n\u201cMiranda reached out to Blake via text,\u201d the source said. \u201cUltimately, they buried the hatchet and have been supporting each other through their latest troubled relationships.\u201d\n\nThe source also said Blake and Miranda have become \u201cclose friends and allies\u201d during the past month and that the former lovers have become each other\u2019s confidante.\n\nInterestingly, everything seems fine between Blake and Gwen based on the photos they have shared on social media. The two also performed together a few days ago and was seen shopping in Greensboro and enjoying themselves at Falls Park. As such, fans of the power couple may take this new breakup rumor with a grain of salt."}

I felt, I mean I\u2019ve seen the girl sing it several times \u2014 Daytona 500, Patriots, Dolphins home opener \u2014 and she crushes the song, so I was surprised to see she tried what she did.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cBut more than that, I just felt bad for her.

So on a lunch break or on a moment where we finished, I don\u2019t know, an hour before crew finished, we\u2019d be like, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s go watch the episode,\u2019\u201d Ventimiglia told Us. \u201cIt became a thing where if I was at work and she wasn\u2019t at work, I would wait until she was there. Or if she was at work and I wasn\u2019t, she would wait until I was there.

This man is hiring me!\u2019 It was one of my first movies. But in my mind, I knew the behavior wasn\u2019t right. It could have gone either way for me.

I don\u2019t have any pictures of anybody else but me because it makes me happy,\u201d he teased before pointing at a snapshot of himself throwing a football. \u201cIf I could do that, I wouldn\u2019t want to be an actor.\u201d\n\nThe Gunsmoke alum also spoke candidly about his late father\u2019s disapproval of his career. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t happy, you know?\u201d Reynolds recalled, noting that his dad never congratulated him on his success. \u201cI even gave him straight lines, like, \u2018What did you think of the last picture, dad?\u2019 And he said, \u2018What picture?\u2019 It was an ouch.\u201d\n\nReynolds added that his dad, a former police chief and World War II veteran, once arrested him for fighting. \u201cHe threw us all in this dunk tank and he came down and [told the rest of those with me], \u2018You can go home, your father came.\u2019 And then he looked at me and he said, \u2018Your father didn\u2019t show up,\u2019\u201d the Boogie Nights actor disclosed. \u201cIt was tough, but I loved him beyond.\u201d\n\nThe Deliverance star also revealed he\u2019d want George Clooney to portray him in a movie about his life. \u201cWhy not?

{"label": false, "txt": "Director\u2019s departure over \u2018creative differences\u2019 expected to delay production, and could even lead to loss of star Daniel Craig\n\nThe immediate future of the James Bond franchise is in chaos after the sudden departure of the director Danny Boyle.\n\n\n\nThree months before shooting on the as-yet-untitled film was scheduled to start, the Oscar-winning film-maker behind Slumdog Millionaire and Trainspotting quit, leaving producers scrambling.\n\nA delay to the scheduled release date of 25 October 2019 looks inevitable; there is also speculation the fallout could stretch further, claiming star Daniel Craig as another victim.\n\nA tweet from the franchise\u2019s official account announced on Monday evening: \u201cMichael G Wilson, Barbara Broccoli and Daniel Craig today announced that due to creative differences Danny Boyle has decided to no longer direct Bond 25.\u201d\n\nIndustry insiders suspect these differences revolve around the script, which Boyle wrote with his long-term collaborator John Hodge. The pair previously collaborated on Trainspotting and its sequel, as well as The Beach, A Life Less Ordinary and Boyle\u2019s debut, Shallow Grave.\n\nThe Bond script was reportedly a deal-breaker for Boyle, who took on the project after the departure of Sam Mendes, who directed Skyfall in 2012 before returning (having previously quit) for 2015\u2019s Spectre.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Daniel Craig in the most recent James Bond film, Spectre. Photograph: Allstar/United Artists\n\nThe producers were reportedly so keen to secure Boyle that they put an already completed screenplay, by the longtime 007 writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, on the back-burner. Purvis and Wade have previously written six Bond films, including all four Craig outings, as well as the final two starring his predecessor, Pierce Brosnan.\n\nHodge and Boyle\u2019s script \u2013 which is different in all respects \u2013 was thought to have been a work-in-progress until recently, and it is understood its themes were more topical than is traditional for a Bond film.\n\nA leaked casting-call sheet indicated that the key villain would be Russian, and Boyle has suggested the film would help the franchise evolve in the #MeToo and #TimesUp era.\n\n\u201cYou write in real time,\u201d he said. \u201cYou acknowledge the legacy of the world of Bond and you write in the world \u2013 but you also write in the modern world as well.\u201d\n\nBoyle indicated that the script featured a considerable coup de cinema \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s a great idea so hopefully it will work\u201d \u2013 which some speculated could involve a high-concept plot in which Bond would be incarcerated for much of the running time \u2013 or, potentially, die.\n\nThe high-stakes nature of such a twist, and the controversial real-life issues the film may have explored, may well have proved a sticking point with producers. Bond films have increasingly toyed with topicality, with Spectre hanging on an initiative to axe field agents in favour of virtual espionage. However, grappling with issues such as sexual assault and Russian influence in geopolitics might have been deemed too great a gamble.\n\nAlthough Mendes and Craig\u2019s tenure has put Bond back in favour with liberal critics as well as punters, Eon Productions, the production company behind the franchise, would be unlikely to want to risk the alienation of a large part of its target market to placate talent. With budgets for Skyfall and Spectre exceeding $300m (\u00a3232m), little compromise for the film\u2019s commercial prospects can be countenanced.\n\nBoyle and Hodge\u2019s script is unlikely to survive the director\u2019s exit, meaning that Purvis and Wade\u2019s draft will need to be polished up for production, and the entire enterprise overhauled to account for a different story, characters and settings. This would add at least a year to the schedule, and the film may not be released until late-2020, at the earliest.\n\nProducers would be reluctant to delay further, as a 2020 release date would already mean a five-year gap between the new film and Spectre. Although there were four years between Craig\u2019s second outing, Quantum of Solace (2008) and his third, Skyfall (2012), the longest break between Bond films is only six years \u2013 between Licence to Kill (1989) and GoldenEye (1995) \u2013 and that involved a change of actor in the leading role.\n\nThis makes it yet more likely that Craig, 50, will call it a day. Until there was confirmation he would return alongside Boyle, speculation had been rife that the actor, a famously reluctant tuxedo wearer, would move on, with Idris Elba and Tom Hardy among those named as possible candidates to replace him.\n\nPromoting Spectre in 2015, Craig said he would rather slash his wrists than reprise the role; months later, his departure seemed all but certain following that of Mendes.\n\nIn 2016, Craig was reportedly offered $150m to star in another two Bond movies by Broccoli, and this year he was confirmed for at least one more.\n\nCraig and Boyle have worked together once before: when the former appeared as Bond, alongside the Queen, in a brief film that featured in the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony, which Boyle directed.\n\nMark Tildesley, Boyle\u2019s favoured production designer, was also recruited to the Bond film this year. His future on the project is now unknown.\n\nBoyle\u2019s latest film, a romcom scripted by Richard Curtis, is scheduled for release in September 2019 \u2013 just a month before the Bond movie was due to come out. It is distributed by Universal Pictures, which recently took on UK distribution rights to the Bond films from Sony Pictures, which was responsible for getting Boyle\u2019s most recent big screen release, T2: Trainspotting, into cinemas.\n\nPossible replacements for Boyle include Christopher Nolan, Christopher McQuarrie and Susanne Bier. McQuarrie\u2019s latest film, Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout, was widely praised for its Bond-style plot and stunts. The film, which stars Tom Cruise, has so far made $500m at the box office."}

Bush also hosted The Billy Bush Show, a nationally syndicated talk and music radio show that aired from 2008 to 2014.[4] He departed Access Hollywood in 2016 after being named a co-host in the third hour of Today. In October 2016, during the presidential election, he became the subject of controversy when a 2005 hot mic recording surfaced of him and presidential candidate Donald Trump having a lewd conversation. Due to this incident, Bush was fired from Today.[5]\n\nEarly life and career [ edit ]\n\nWilliam Hall Bush was born in Manhattan, New York,[1] to Josephine Colwell Bush (n\u00e9e Bradley) and Jonathan Bush, a banker.[6][7] William Bush's uncle (his father's older brother) is George H. W. Bush, the 41st President of the United States. George W. Bush, the 43rd President, and former Florida governor Jeb Bush are William Bush's first cousins.[3]\n\nBush attended middle school at St. Bernard's School in Manhattan and high school at St. George's School in Middletown, Rhode Island.[8] He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in international studies and government from Colby College in 1994.[2] He was also a four-year letterman and a two-time co-captain as a junior and senior with the Mules' men's lacrosse team.[9][10] As of 2017, he is 4th (182), 8th (97), and 4th (85) in career points, goals and assists respectively in program history and was a first-team All-NESCAC in 1994.[11]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nFM radio [ edit ]\n\nBush began his career hosting the afternoon drive show on WLKZ-FM in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, later moving to Washington, D.C., where he hosted the midday show on WARW-FM.[citation needed] In March 1997, Bush joined WWZZ-FM (Z104) in D.C. as host of Billy Bush and the Bush League Morning Show, which aired until January 2001.[12]\n\nEarly television work [ edit ]\n\nIn January 2003, Bush hosted a short-lived NBC prime-time version of Let's Make a Deal.[12] He was also a correspondent for WNBC-TV's Today in New York morning show.[12][13]\n\nBush joined Access Hollywood, a daily entertainment news magazine, as East Coast correspondent in December 2001.[1] He was promoted to co-anchor in June 2004.\n\nWhile working at Access Hollywood, he was present at high-profile red carpet events including the Golden Globes, Grammys, and Academy Awards, and hosted ABC's live pre-show for the 2004, 2005 and 2006 Academy Awards and the 2006 Emmy Red Carpet Special.\n\nBush was a reporter for NBC at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, and was the host for Access Hollywood's coverage of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino as well as the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. In addition, Bush hosted the reality competition Grease: You're the One that I Want! on NBC in 2007, and stood in for Meredith Vieira for a week of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire shows on April 21\u201325, 2008. He and Vieira both had credited cameos as hosts of fictional game shows in the 2004 remake of Ira Levin's 1972 satirical thriller The Stepford Wives.\n\nHe returned to radio with The Billy Bush Show, a nightly talk radio and entertainment interview show. It airs from KBIG in Los Angeles and is syndicated by Westwood One. The show is written by Ryan Miller and produced by Corrin Barlow, while Bush and Access Hollywood executive producer Rob Silverstein are the show's executive producers.[13] The show, which airs evenings Monday through Friday, focuses on the top entertainment stories and personalities in the news, and features celebrity guests and listener calls.\n\nBush co-hosted the Miss Universe pageant four times: in 2003 and 2004 with Daisy Fuentes; in 2005 with fellow Access Hollywood co-anchor Nancy O'Dell; and in 2009 with Claudia Jordan. He has also co-hosted the Miss USA pageant four times, with almost the same partners: in 2003 with Fuentes; 2004 and 2005 with O'Dell; and again in 2009, this time with Nadine Velazquez. After the 65th Annual Golden Globe Awards of 2008 were cancelled as a result of the 2007\u201308 Writers Guild of America strike, Bush co-hosted the 65th Annual Golden Globe Awards Announcement press conference with O'Dell on January 13, 2008.\n\nBush was named one of Esquire magazine's \"10 Men\" in July 2005.[13] \"He's a furious, inventive interviewer, unafraid of playing the fool in exchange for a true reaction\", opined the writer of the accompanying magazine profile.[14]\n\nFrom September 13, 2010, to October 2016, Bush co-hosted the syndicated national daily entertainment talk show Access Hollywood Live, along with co-host Kit Hoover.

Bush is heard laughing about Trump's failed effort to seduce a married woman, and joining in by commenting on actress Arianne Zucker's appearance, calling her \"hot as shit.\"[22] The video was made on the NBC Studios lot in the course of videotaping an Access Hollywood episode in mid-September 2005,[23] promoting Trump's cameo appearance in an episode of daytime soap opera Days of Our Lives to promote The Apprentice.\n\nIn the video, Trump discussed a failed attempt to seduce Bush's then-co-host Nancy O'Dell:[24] \"I moved on her, and I failed. I\u2019ll admit it. I did try and fuck her. She was married.\" He also talked about stars groping women: \"...you just kiss...when you're a star they let you do it. You can do anything [Bush: Anything you want]...grab them by the pussy...\"[22]\n\nWhen the news of the footage first broke, Bush was at New York's JFK International Airport waiting to take off for Los Angeles. He spent the six-hour flight reading news reports on the unfolding controversy. By the time he arrived in Los Angeles, a horde of paparazzi had materialized at Los Angeles International Airport and at his home in Los Angeles, where they remained for more than a week. Bush spent the remainder of that weekend trying to save his job at Today, which had already garnered controversy, first over Bush's lack of hard-news experience and the rude tone he exhibited during red carpet events and then over the Ryan Lochte matter. Initially, NBC News signaled Bush would return that Monday to apologize on-air. Bush later stated, \"I would have welcomed addressing the audience.\"[25]\n\nHowever, Bush received criticism online and calls for his resignation from the show, with The Washington Post stating, \"Bush's public image was damaged\u2014perhaps beyond repair.\"[20] He issued an apology, stating: \"Obviously I'm embarrassed and ashamed. It's no excuse, but this happened eleven years ago. I was younger, less mature, and acted foolishly in playing along. I'm very sorry.\"[26] Bush was 33 years old at the time the video was made. On October 9, 2016, NBC announced that Bush was suspended from Today for his role in the 2005 video. He was suspended pending an internal review.[27] By October 17, Bush had been fired.[28][29]\n\nAfter The New York Times reported in late November 2017 that Trump had privately told people, including a sitting senator, that the voice on the tape was not his, Bush published an op-ed in the paper on December 3, reaffirming that the voice in the tape was the president's and accusing him of engaging in revisionist history.[30][31]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nHe married Sydney Davis in April 1998[32] and the couple have three daughters: Josephine, Mary and Lillie.[2] On September 19, 2017, the couple announced they were separating.[32]\n\nOn November 27, 2017, Bush was hospitalized after being hit in the head by a golf ball.[33]\n\nOn July 15, 2018, Billy and his wife Sydney announced their divorce due to irreconcilable differences.

She reportedly helped Markle choose her wedding dress designer and is also making a custom piece for the big day.\n\nPriyanka Chopra\n\nThe Quantico actress and the Suits star first met at the ELLE Women in Television dinner in 2016. \"We bonded as actors,\" she told People of their friendship. \"We just became friends, like two girls would.\"\n\nSince Meghan and Harry's relationship went public, Chopra has urged people to consider Markle as more than just the prince's girlfriend. She called Vanity Fair's profile of the actress \"just a little sexist\" because it mainly focused on Markle's relationship with Harry, and she shut down Wendy Williams when she described Markle as \"Prince Harry's girlfriend.\"\n\nWhen Harper's BAZAAR Arabia asked her if she's going to be a bridesmaid at the royal wedding, Chopra teased, \"If you see me there, you\u2019ll know.\"\n\nSerena Williams\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe star athlete first met Markle in 2014, at DIRECTV's Celebrity Beach Bowl, E!

Meghan recalled in her former lifestyle site, The Tig, \"We hit it off immediately, taking pictures, laughing through the flag football game we were both playing in, and chatting not about tennis or acting, but about all the good old fashioned girly stuff. So began our friendship.\"\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nIn the following years, Markle supported Williams through her matches at competitions like the U.S. Open and Wimbledon (where she actually sat a few rows away from Pippa Middleton). Williams even contributed to a few blog posts to The Tig, according to E!.\n\n\"She quickly became a confidante I would text when I was traveling, the friend I would rally around for her tennis matches, and the down to earth chick I was able to grab lunch with just a couple weeks ago in Toronto,\" E! says Markle wrote on The Tig, describing her friendship with Williams.\n\n\"We are both the same age, have a penchant for hot sauces, and adore fashion, but what connects us more than those things is perhaps our belief in exceeding expectations\u2013our endless ambition,\" she added.\n\nThough Meghan unfortunately wasn't present at Williams' nuptials to Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian in November 2017, there's still a chance the newlywed tennis champ could show up at Windsor Castle for Markle.\n\nSarah Rafferty or Gina Torres\n\nRafferty, Markle, and Torres promoting Suits Season 4 Getty Images\n\nMarkle's fellow Suits actresses may also be helping her ahead of the wedding. In August 2016, the bride-to-be posted an Instagram (which has now been deleted, like the rest of her social media accounts) dedicated to her costars, with the caption: \"Celebrating our friendship of six years and counting. So much deep love for these two women.\" The former actress also nicknamed Rafferty her \"Suits sister wife.\"\n\nAfter Harry and Meghan's relationship was confirmed in November 2016, Rafferty gave a brief response in an interview with the AP. \"I don't comment on my castmates' personal lives, but of course, it's very exciting,\" she said. \"And I'm very happy for her.\"\n\nIn February 2017, tabloid site OK Magazine reported that Torres and her husband Laurence Fishburne (whom she divorced in November) had a double date with Markle and Harry.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nWhether or not Rafferty and Torres are in the bridal party, we can probably expect them to be at the ceremony, since the cast of Suits has reportedly nabbed royal wedding invitations.

{"label": false, "txt": "'Bates Motel' alum Kerry Ehrin will replace Jay Carson ('House of Cards') on the morning show drama and has signed Apple's first overall deal.\n\nApple has yet to launch a scripted series, but it has already replaced two showrunners.\n\nKerry Ehrin (Bates Motel) is poised to sign Apple's first overall deal and take over for Jay Carson (House of Cards) on the tech giant's Jennifer Aniston-Reese Witherspoon morning show drama.\n\nApple and production studio Media Res have parted ways with Carson following \"creative differences\" on the drama that offers an inside look at the lives of two morning show hosts. Carson was poised to pen the script and serve as showrunner.\n\nFollowing the end of her deal with Universal Television, Ehrin will move to Apple with an exclusive overall development and production deal that includes showrunning duties on the untitled morning show project starring Aniston and Witherspoon. (She most recently reunited with Jason Katims and served as a consulting producer on NBC's midseason musical drama Rise.)\n\nThe morning show drama landed at Apple in a competitive situation with multiple outlets bidding. Apple handed out a two-season, 20-episode order for the series \u2014 marking its first order under new heads of video programming Zack Van Amburg and Jamie Erlicht. Brian Stelter's book Top of the Morning: Inside the Cutthroat World of Morning TV \u2014 which was previously in development at Lifetime as a TV movie \u2014 will provide additional background for the show, which is based on an original concept by Media Res' Michael Ellenberg. Witherspoon and Aniston will also executive produce and co-own the show. Sources note the two stars are earning more than $1.25 million per episode for their starring and exec producing roles on the series and will also receive a cut of the show's back-end. The project marks Aniston's return to scripted television more than a decade after Friends.\n\nFor Ehrin, the move comes after she served as co-showrunner alongside Carlton Cuse on A&E's Psycho prequel TV series Bates Motel. Sources say Ehrin landed at Apple in a competitive situation with other studios vying to sign the veteran writer, producer and showrunner, whose credits include Friday Night Lights and Parenthood.\n\nThe morning show drama becomes Apple's second scripted original to change showrunners. Bryan Fuller (and Hart Hanson) exited Apple's Amazing Stories anthology in February. A replacement has yet to be named.\n\nEhrin's deal comes as streaming giant Netflix has been making an aggressive push to sign top producers to overall deals after forging nine-figure pacts with Shonda Rhimes (Scandal, Grey's Anatomy) and Ryan Murphy (Glee, American Crime Story). Rhimes and Murphy had both been in the broadcast studio system for more than a decade, at ABC Studios and 20th Century Fox Television, respectively. Netflix's aggressive payday has only intensified the war for talent among broadcast, cable and streaming outlets.\n\nEhrin is repped by Rothman Brecher.\n\nSince hiring Van Amburg and Erlicht from Sony Pictures Television Studios, Apple has been on an aggressive buying spree, landing series from M. Night Shyamalan, Outlander's Ron Moore, La La Land's Damien Chazelle and a couple more from Witherspoon, among others."}

{"label": false, "txt": "The place is known as the Miraval Ch\u00e2teau, a castle and vineyard in the tiny town of Correns, near Aix-en-Provence in the south of France. Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt bought it in 2008 for \u20ac45 million (about $67 million at the time), and it hosted their wedding six years later.\n\nAfter three years of legal battle, the decision was originally delivered in April but wasn't revealed until French media broke the story last week. Meanwhile, the aggrieved designer, Odile Soudant, has filed another suit demanding to be legally recognized as the creator of the project.\n\nThe artist, who specializes in light installations, accused the Jolie-Pitt company of driving her business, Lumi\u00e8res Studio, into bankruptcy. She's also fighting Pitt for the intellectual property rights to the lighting she designed for the 17th century chateau and its outbuildings. Of the payout, \u20ac60,000 ($70,800) covers damage to her reputation, which she says has been severely affected by the failed project.\n\nPitt's lawyers had argued that the project was late and over budget\u2014and that the design was Pitt's brainchild.\n\n\u201cWhen, in 2010, Brad Pitt came to ask her to bring to light four buildings of his domain at Miraval, the plastic artist Odile Soudant did not suspect that this Pharaonic building site was going to cause her ruin,\u201d writes Le Point.\n\nThe Hollywood couple, according to the newspaper Liberation, which broke the story, launched a large remodeling plan intended to transform the property to their liking. Pitt hired Soudart in 2010 to run a \u20ac25 million project that would bring natural light into four of the buildings of the 40-bedroom domain where, in the late 1970s, the band Pink Floyd had recorded an album.\n\nAccording to the newspaper, he wanted the visual artist to create \"an exceptional place with light at the center of everything.\"\n\nThe collaboration went smoothly for three years until Pitt discovered that the company acting as the general contractor managing the network of businesses involved in the remodeling was inflating the costs. He then blocked all additional payments.\n\nUntil then, the artist and her 17 assistants and subcontractors had been working for the project in a Paris studio and partially completed the redesign at the property. Despite the fact that Pitt was no longer paying, according to her declaration, he asked her to continue working.\n\n\u201cOdile, I need you. Come here please. I need you to finish,\u201d Brad Pitt wrote in an email to Soudart, according the court documents published by Liberation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how things happen in France but in the United States, friends don\u2019t attack friends,\" he wrote her in another email. \"I\u2019ve been nothing but a fan of your work. Do not attack. Let\u2019s finish the project and be proud of it. The work is too good to end on a bad note. Life is too short, my friend,\u201d he wrote to her in another.\n\nIn a third message, he wrote: \u201cDon\u2019t waste time with legal action. Follow your artistic journey and don\u2019t worry about the rest.\u201d\n\nHer answers were desperate: \"My company and my bank accounts are well beyond the maximum. I can no longer use my credit card. I'm sinking. I do not ask you to pay everything, but at least a part...I do not know how to make you understand the urgency in which we are now. Without a quick solution, the consequences will be catastrophic.\u201d\n\nBut the legal struggle has not yet ended. Soudart is now accusing Pitt of appropriating the creation of her work. The actor\u2019s lawyers replied that the castle is \"purely private\" and not subject to copyright.\n\nBut Le Point concludes that \u201cthe estate is not as private as its owners claim: Recently it served as a backdrop for the latest Guerlain ad campaign by Terrence Malick. In one of the scenes, we see clearly\u2014no pun intended\u2014a luminous installation conceived by the plastic artist.\u201d\n\nThe one minute clip called \"Notes of a Woman\" shows Angelina Jolie strolling through different spaces at Chateau Miraval, practicing her lines and wandering through the vineyard as a man creates a perfum."}

{"label": false, "txt": "45th President of the United States\n\nDonald John Trump (born June 14, 1946) is the 45th and current President of the United States. Before entering politics, he was a businessman and television personality.\n\nTrump was born and raised in the New York City borough of Queens, and received an economics degree from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He took charge of his family's real estate business in 1971, renamed it to The Trump Organization, and expanded it into Manhattan. The company built or renovated skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. Trump later started various side ventures, including licensing his name for real estate and consumer products. He managed the company until his 2017 inauguration. He co-authored several books, including The Art of the Deal. He owned the Miss Universe and Miss USA beauty pageants from 1996 to 2015, and he produced and hosted the reality television show The Apprentice from 2003 to 2015. Forbes estimates his net worth to be $3.1 billion.\n\nTrump entered the 2016 presidential race as a Republican and defeated sixteen opponents in the primaries. Commentators described his political positions as populist, protectionist, and nationalist. His campaign received extensive free media coverage; many of his public statements were controversial or false. Trump was elected president in a surprise victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. He became the oldest and wealthiest person ever to assume the presidency, the first without prior military or government service, and the fifth to have won the election while losing the popular vote. His election and policies have sparked numerous protests. Many of his comments and actions have been perceived as racially charged.\n\nDuring his presidency, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, citing security concerns; after several legal challenges, the Supreme Court upheld the policy's third revision. He signed tax cut legislation which also rescinded the individual insurance mandate provision of the Affordable Care Act and opened the Arctic Refuge for oil drilling. He enacted a partial repeal of the Dodd-Frank Act that had imposed stricter constraints on banks in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. He pursued his America First agenda in foreign policy, withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade negotiations, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal. He recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and imposed import tariffs on various goods, triggering a trade war with China.\n\nAfter Trump dismissed FBI Director James Comey, the Justice Department appointed Robert Mueller as Special Counsel to investigate \"any links and/or coordination\" between the Trump campaign and the Russian government in its election interference. Trump has repeatedly denied accusations of collusion and obstruction of justice, calling the investigation a politically motivated \"witch hunt\".\n\nFamily and personal life\n\nAncestry and parents\n\nTrump's ancestors originated from the German village of Kallstadt in the Palatinate on his father's side, and from the Outer Hebrides in Scotland on his mother's side. All of his grandparents and his mother were born in Europe.\n\nTrump's paternal grandfather, Frederick Trump, first immigrated to the United States in 1885 at the age of 16 and became a citizen in 1892.[2] He amassed a fortune operating boomtown restaurants and boarding houses in the Seattle area and the Klondike region of Canada during its gold rush.[2] On a visit to Kallstadt, he met Elisabeth Christ and married her in 1902. The couple permanently settled in New York in 1905. Frederick died from influenza during the 1918 pandemic.\n\nTrump as a child\n\nTrump's father Fred was born in 1905 in the Bronx. Fred started working with his mother in real estate when he was 15, shortly after his father's death. Their company, \"E. Trump & Son\",[nb 2] founded in 1923,[9] was primarily active in the New York boroughs of Queens and Brooklyn. Fred eventually built and sold thousands of houses, barracks, and apartments.[10] In 1971, Donald Trump was made president of the company, which was later renamed the Trump Organization.\n\nIn spite of his German ancestry, \"Fred Trump sought to pass himself off as Swedish amid anti-German sentiment sparked by World War II.\"[12] Donald propagated this myth in The Art of the Deal.[12][13][14]\n\nTrump's mother Mary Anne MacLeod was born in Tong, Lewis, Scotland. At age 18 in 1930, she immigrated to New York, where she worked as a maid.[15] Fred and Mary were married in 1936 and raised their family in Queens.[15][16]\n\nEarly life and education\n\nDonald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at the Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, Queens, New York City, the fourth of five children.[19] Trump grew up in Jamaica, Queens, and attended the Kew-Forest School from kindergarten through seventh grade. At age 13, he was enrolled in the New York Military Academy, a private boarding school, after his parents discovered that he had made frequent trips into Manhattan without their permission.[21]\n\nIn 1964, Trump enrolled at Fordham University.[22] After two years, he transferred to the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.[22] While at Wharton, he worked at the family business, Elizabeth Trump & Son.[24] He graduated in May 1968 with a Bachelor of Science degree in economics.[22][25][26]\n\nWhile in college from 1964 to 1968, Trump obtained four student deferments from serving in the military.[27][28] In 1966, he was deemed fit for service based upon a medical examination and in July 1968, after graduating from college, was briefly classified as eligible to serve by a local draft board. In October 1968, he was given a medical deferment which he later attributed to spurs in both heels, and classified as 1-Y, \"unqualified for duty except in the case of a national emergency.\"[29] In the December 1969 draft lottery, Trump's birthday, June 14, received a high number which would have given him a low probability to be called to military service even without the 1-Y.[29][30][31] In 1972, he was reclassified as 4-F, disqualifying him for service.[30][32]\n\nFamily\n\nTrump grew up with three elder siblings\u2014Maryanne, Fred Jr., and Elizabeth\u2014as well as a younger brother named Robert. Maryanne is an inactive Federal Appeals Court judge on the Third Circuit.[33]\n\nTrump has five children by three marriages, as well as nine grandchildren.[34][35] His first two marriages ended in widely publicized divorces.[36]\n\nIn 1977, Trump married Czech model Ivana Zeln\u00ed\u010dkov\u00e1 at the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan, in a ceremony performed by the Reverend Norman Vincent Peale.[37][38] They had three children: Donald Jr. (born 1977), Ivanka (born 1981), and Eric (born 1984). Ivana became a naturalized United States citizen in 1988.[39] The couple divorced in 1992, following Trump's affair with actress Marla Maples.[40]\n\nIn October 1993, Maples gave birth to Trump's daughter, who was named Tiffany in honor of high-end retailer Tiffany & Company.[41] Maples and Trump were married two months later in December 1993.[42] They divorced in 1999,[43] and Tiffany was raised by Marla in California.[44]\n\nIn 2005, Trump married his third wife, Slovenian model Melania Knauss, at Bethesda-by-the-Sea Episcopal Church in Palm Beach, Florida.[45] In 2006, Melania became a United States citizen[46] and gave birth to a son, Barron.[47][48] Melania became First Lady when Trump became president in January 2017.[49]\n\nUpon his inauguration as president, Trump delegated the management of his real estate business to his two adult sons, Eric and Don Jr.[50] His daughter Ivanka resigned from the Trump Organization and moved to Washington, D.C., with her husband Jared Kushner. She serves as an assistant to the president,[51] and he is a Senior Advisor in the White House.[52]\n\nReligion\n\nTrump is Presbyterian.[53][54][55] His ancestors were Lutheran on his paternal grandfather's side in Germany and Presbyterian on his mother's side in Scotland.[57] His parents married in a Manhattan Presbyterian church in 1936. As a child, he attended the First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica, Queens, where he had his confirmation.[38] In the 1970s, his family joined the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan.[59] The pastor, Norman Vincent Peale, ministered to Trump's family and mentored him until Peale's death in 1993.[59] Trump has cited Peale and his works during interviews when asked about the role of religion in his personal life.[59]\n\nTrump says while he's \"not sure\" if he's asked God for forgiveness, he takes Holy Communion as often as possible, believing it to be a form of 'cleansing'.[53] While campaigning, Trump referred to The Art of the Deal as his second favorite book after the Bible, saying, \"Nothing beats the Bible.\"[61] The New York Times reported that evangelical Christians nationwide thought \"that his heart was in the right place, that his intentions for the country were pure\".[62]\n\nTrump has associations with a number of Christian spiritual leaders, including Florida pastor Paula White, who has been called his \"closest spiritual confidant\".[63] In 2015, he released a list of religious advisers, including James Dobson, Jerry Falwell Jr., Ralph Reed, Michele Bachmann, Robert Jeffress, and others.[64][65]\n\nHealth\n\nTrump does not drink alcohol except occasional wine, such as at communion.[66][53] This decision arose in part from watching his older brother Fred Jr. suffer from alcoholism that contributed to his early death in 1981.[67][68] He also said that he has never smoked cigarettes or consumed drugs, including marijuana.[69]\n\nIn December 2015, Trump's personal physician, Harold Bornstein, released a superlative-laden letter of health praising Trump for \"extraordinary physical strength and stamina\".[70] Bornstein later said that Trump himself had dictated the contents.[71] A followup medical report showed Trump's blood pressure, liver and thyroid functions to be in normal ranges, and that he takes a statin.[72][73] In January 2018, Trump was examined by White House physician Ronny Jackson, who stated that he was in excellent health, although his weight and cholesterol level were higher than recommended,[66] and that his cardiac assessment revealed no medical issues.[74] Several outside cardiologists commented that Trump's weight, lifestyle and LDL cholesterol ought to have raised serious concerns about his cardiac health.[75]\n\nWealth\n\nTrump is the beneficiary of several trust funds set up by his father and paternal grandmother beginning in 1949.[77] In 1976, Fred Trump set up trust funds of $1 million (equivalent to $4.3 million in 2017) for each of his five children and three grandchildren; Donald Trump received annual payments from his trust fund, for example, $90,000 in 1980 and $214,605 in 1981.[77] By 1993, when Trump took two loans totaling $30 million from his siblings, their anticipated shares of Fred's fortune were $35 million each.[78][77] Upon Fred Trump's death in 1999, his will divided $20 million after taxes (equivalent to $29.38 million in 2017) among his surviving children.[77][79][80]\n\nTrump said that he began his career with \"a small loan of one million dollars\" from his father.[81] He appeared on the initial Forbes 400 list of richest Americans in 1982 with an estimated $200 million fortune shared with his father.[82] Former Forbes reporter Jonathan Greenberg stated in 2018 that during the 1980s Trump had deceived him about his actual net worth and his share of the family assets in order to appear on the list.[83][84] Trump made the Forbes World's Billionaires list for the first time in 1989,[85] but he was dropped from the Forbes 400 from 1990 to 1995 following business losses.[82] In 2005, Deutsche Bank loan documents pegged Trump's net worth at $788 million, while Forbes quoted $2.6 billion and journalist Tim O'Brien gave a range of $150 million to $250 million.[85] In its 2018 billionaires ranking, Forbes estimated Trump's net worth at $3.1 billion[nb 1] (766th in the world, 248th in the U.S.)[88] making him one of the richest politicians in American history.\n\nWhen he filed mandatory financial disclosure forms with the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) in July 2015, Trump claimed a net worth of about $10 billion;[89] however FEC figures cannot corroborate this estimate because they only show each of his largest buildings as being worth \"over $50 million\", yielding total assets worth more than $1.4 billion and debt over $265 million.[90] Trump reported a yearly income of $362 million for 2014[89] and $611 million from January 2015 to May 2016.[91]\n\nA 2016 analysis of Trump's business career by The Economist concluded that his performance since 1985 had been \"mediocre compared with the stock market and property in New York\".[92] A subsequent analysis by The Washington Post concluded that \"Trump is a mix of braggadocio, business failures, and real success\".[93]\n\nBusiness career\n\nReal estate\n\nIn 1968, Trump began his career at his father Fred's real estate development company, E. Trump & Son, which, among other interests, owned middle-class rental housing in New York City's outer boroughs.[95] Trump worked for his father to revitalize the Swifton Village apartment complex in Cincinnati, Ohio, which the elder Trump had bought in 1964.[96][97] The management of the property was sued for racial discrimination in 1969; the suit \"was quietly settled at Fred Trump's direction.\"[97] The Trumps sold the property in 1972, with vacancy on the rise.[97]\n\nWhen his father became chairman of the board in 1971, Trump was promoted to president of the company and renamed it The Trump Organization.[98] In 1973, he and his father drew wider attention when the Justice Department contended in a lawsuit that their company systematically discriminated against African Americans who wished to rent apartments. The Department alleged that the Trump Organization had screened out people based on race and not low income as the Trumps had stated. Under an agreement reached in 1975, the Trumps made no admission of wrongdoing and made the Urban League an intermediary for qualified minority applicants.[99][100] Trump's attorney at the time was Roy Cohn, who valued both positive and negative publicity, and responded to attacks with forceful counterattacks; Trump later emulated Cohn's style.\n\nManhattan developments\n\nIn 1978, Trump launched his Manhattan real estate business by purchasing a 50 percent stake in the derelict Commodore Hotel, located next to Grand Central Terminal. The purchase was funded largely by a $70 million construction loan that was guaranteed jointly by Fred Trump and the Hyatt hotel chain.[77] When the remodeling was finished, the hotel reopened in 1980 as the Grand Hyatt Hotel.\n\nThe same year, Trump obtained the rights to develop Trump Tower, a 58-story, 664-foot-high (202 m) skyscraper in Midtown Manhattan.[104][105] To make way for the new building, a crew of undocumented Polish workers demolished the historic Bonwit Teller store, including art deco features that had initially been marked for preservation. The building was completed in 1983 and houses both the primary penthouse condominium residence of Trump and the headquarters of The Trump Organization.[107][108] Architectural critic Paul Goldberger said in 1983 that he was surprised to find the tower's atrium was \"the most pleasant interior public space to be completed in New York in some years\".[110]\n\nIn 1980, repairs began on Central Park's Wollman Rink, with an anticipated two-and-a-half year construction time frame. Because of flaws in the design and numerous problems during construction, the project remained unfinished by May 1986 and was estimated to require another 18 months and $2 million to $3 million to complete.[111][112] Trump was awarded a contract as the general contractor in June 1986 to finish the repairs by December 15 with a cost ceiling of $3 million, with the actual costs to be reimbursed by the city.[112] Trump hired an architect, a construction company, and a Canadian ice-rink manufacturer and completed the work in four months, $775,000 under budget.[112] He operated the rink for a year and gave some of the profits to charity and public works projects[113] in exchange for the rink's concession rights.[114][112] Trump managed the rink from 1987 to 1995. He received another contract in 2001 which was extended until 2021.[115][116] According to journalist Joyce Purnick, Trump's \"Wollman success was also the stuff of a carefully crafted, self-promotional legend.\"[115] While the work was in progress, Trump called numerous press conferences, for example for the completion of the laying of the pipes and the pouring of the cement.[117] In 1987, he also unsuccessfully tried to get the city to rename the landmark after him; the Trump logo is prominently displayed on the railing encircling the rink, on the Zamboni,[115] on the rental skates,[116] and on the rink's website.[116][118]\n\nIn 1988 Trump acquired the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan for $407 million and appointed his wife Ivana to manage its operation. Trump invested $50 million to restore the building, which he called \"the Mona Lisa\". According to hotel expert Thomas McConnell, the Trumps boosted it from a three-star to a four-star ranking. They sold it in 1995, by which time Ivana was no longer involved in the hotel's day-to-day operations.[121]\n\nIn 1994, Trump's company refurbished the Gulf and Western Building on Columbus Circle with design and structural enhancements turning it into a 44-story luxury residential and hotel property[122][123] known as Trump International Hotel and Tower.\n\nIn 1996, Trump acquired the Bank of Manhattan Trust Building, which was a vacant seventy-one story skyscraper on Wall Street. After an extensive renovation, the high-rise was renamed the Trump Building at 40 Wall Street. In 1997, he began construction on Riverside South, which he dubbed Trump Place, a multi-building development along the Hudson River. He and the other investors in the project ultimately sold their interest for $1.8 billion in 2005 in what was then the biggest residential sale in the history of New York City.[126] From 1994 to 2002, Trump owned a 50 percent share of the Empire State Building. He intended to rename it \"Trump Empire State Building Tower Apartments\" if he had been able to boost his share.[127] In 2001, Trump completed Trump World Tower.[129] In 2002, Trump acquired the former Hotel Delmonico, which was renovated and reopened in 2004 as the Trump Park Avenue; the building consisted of 35 stories of luxury condominiums.\n\nPalm Beach estate\n\nMar-a-Lago in 2009\n\nIn 1985, Trump acquired the Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, for $10 million, $7 million for the real estate and $3 million for the furnishings.[131][132] His initial offer of $28 million had been rejected, and he was able to obtain the property for the lower price after a real-estate market \"slump\".[133] The home was built in the 1920s by heiress and socialite Marjorie Merriweather Post.[134] After her death, her heirs unsuccessfully tried to donate the property to the government before putting it up for sale.[134][135] In addition to using a wing of the estate as a home, Trump turned Mar-a-Lago into a private club. In order to join, prospective members had to pay an initiation fee[136] and annual dues. The initiation fee was $100,000 until 2016; it was doubled to $200,000 in January 2017.[138][139]\n\nAtlantic City casinos\n\nAfter New Jersey legalized casino gambling in 1977, Trump went to Atlantic City to explore new business opportunities. Seven years later, he opened Harrah's at Trump Plaza hotel and casino; the project was built by Trump with financing from the Holiday Corporation who also managed its operation. It was renamed \"Trump Plaza\" soon after it opened. The casino's poor financial results exacerbated disagreements between Trump and Holiday Corp., which led to Trump's paying $70 million in May 1986 to buy out their interest in the property.[142][143] Trump also acquired a partially completed building in Atlantic City from the Hilton Corporation for $320 million; when completed in 1985, that hotel and casino became Trump Castle, and Trump's wife Ivana managed that property until 1988.\n\nTrump acquired his third casino in Atlantic City, the Taj Mahal, in 1988 while it was under construction, through a complex transaction with Merv Griffin and Resorts International.[146] It was completed at a cost of $1.1 billion and opened in April 1990.[147][148] The project was financed with $675 million in junk bonds[149] and was a major gamble by Trump. The project underwent debt restructuring the following year,[151] leaving Trump with 50 percent ownership.[152] Facing \"enormous debt\", he sold his airline, Trump Shuttle, and his 282-foot (86 m) megayacht, the Trump Princess, which had been indefinitely docked in Atlantic City while leased to his casinos for use by wealthy gamblers.[153][154]\n\nIn 1995, Trump founded Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts (THCR), which assumed ownership of Trump Plaza, Trump Castle, and the Trump Casino in Gary, Indiana.[156] THCR purchased Taj Mahal in 1996 and underwent bankruptcy restructuring in 2004 and 2009, leaving Trump with 10 percent ownership in the Trump Taj Mahal and other Trump casino properties.[157] Trump remained chairman of THCR until 2009.[158]\n\nGolf courses\n\nAs of December 2016 , the Trump Organization owns or operates 18 golf course and golf resorts in the United States and abroad.[159] According to his FEC personal financial disclosure, his 2015 golf and resort revenue amounted to $382 million,[160][91] while his three European golf courses did not show a profit.[161]\n\nTrump began acquiring and constructing golf courses in 1999; his first property was the Trump International Golf Club, West Palm Beach in Florida.[162] By 2007, Trump owned 4 courses around the US.[162] Following the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008, Trump began purchasing existing golf courses and re-designing them.[163] Trump's use of these courses during his presidency was controversial. Despite frequently criticizing his predecessor Barack Obama for his numerous golf outings, Trump golfed 11 times during his first eight weeks in office.[164] According to CNN, Trump visited Trump-owned golf courses 91 times in 2017, although the White House does not disclose whether or not the president actually played on each of those visits.[165]\n\nBranding and licensing\n\nThe Trump Organization expanded its business into branding and management by licensing the Trump name for a large number of building projects that are owned and operated by other people and companies. In the late 2000s and early 2010s, The Trump Organization expanded its footprint beyond New York with the branding and management of various developers' hotel towers around the world. These included projects in Chicago, Las Vegas, Washington D.C., Panama City, Toronto, and Vancouver. There are also Trump-branded buildings in Dubai, Honolulu, Istanbul, Manila, Mumbai, and Indonesia.[166]\n\nThe Trump name has also been licensed for various consumer products and services, including foodstuffs, apparel, adult learning courses, and home furnishings. These ventures met with mixed success for Trump, his partners, and investors in the projects.[citation needed] In 2011, Forbes' financial experts estimated the value of the Trump brand at $200 million. Trump disputed this valuation, saying his brand was worth about $3 billion.[167] According to an analysis by The Washington Post, there are more than 50 licensing or management deals involving Trump's name, which have generated at least $59 million in yearly revenue for his companies.[168]\n\nLawsuits and bankruptcies\n\nAs of April 2018 , Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions, according to a running tally by USA Today.[169] As of 2016 , he or one of his companies had been the plaintiff in 1,900 cases and the defendant in 1,450. With Trump or his company as plaintiff, more than half the cases have been against gamblers at his casinos who had failed to pay off their debts. With Trump or his company as a defendant, the most common type of case involved personal injury cases at his hotels. In cases where there was a clear resolution, Trump's side won 451 times and lost 38.[170][171]\n\nTrump has never filed for personal bankruptcy, but his hotel and casino businesses have been declared bankrupt six times between 1991 and 2009 in order to re-negotiate debt with banks and owners of stock and bonds.[172][173] Because the businesses used Chapter 11 bankruptcy, they were allowed to operate while negotiations proceeded. Trump was quoted by Newsweek in 2011 saying, \"I do play with the bankruptcy laws \u2013 they're very good for me\" as a tool for trimming debt.[174][175] The six bankruptcies were the result of over-leveraged hotel and casino businesses in Atlantic City and New York: Trump Taj Mahal (1991), Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino (1992), Plaza Hotel (1992), Trump Castle Hotel and Casino (1992), Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts (2004), and Trump Entertainment Resorts (2009).[176][177]\n\nSide ventures\n\nAfter Trump took over the family real estate firm in 1971 and renamed it The Trump Organization, he expanded its real estate operations and ventured into other business activities. The company eventually became the umbrella organization for several hundred individual business ventures and partnerships.[178]\n\nSports\n\nIn September 1983, Trump purchased the New Jersey Generals\u2014an American football team that played in the United States Football League (USFL). After the 1985 season, the league folded largely due to Trump's strategy of moving games to a fall schedule where they competed with the NFL for audience, and trying to force a merger with the NFL by bringing an antitrust lawsuit against the organization.[179][180]\n\nTrump operated golf courses in several countries.[179] He hosted several boxing matches at the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, including Mike Tyson's 1988 heavyweight championship fight against Michael Spinks.[181] He also acted as a financial advisor to Mike Tyson.[182] In 1989 and 1990, Trump lent his name to the Tour de Trump cycling stage race, which was an attempt to create an American equivalent of European races such as the Tour de France or the Giro d'Italia.[183]\n\nMiss Universe\n\nFrom 1996 to 2015, Trump owned part or all of the Miss Universe pageants.[184][185] The pageants include Miss USA and Miss Teen USA. His management of this business involved his family members\u2014daughter Ivanka once hosted Miss Teen USA. He became dissatisfied with how CBS scheduled the pageants, and took both Miss Universe and Miss USA to NBC in 2002.[187][188] In 2007, Trump received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work as producer of Miss Universe.[189]\n\nFollowing Trump's controversial statements about illegal Mexican immigrants during his 2015 presidential campaign kickoff speech, NBC ended its business relationship with him, stating that it would no longer air the Miss Universe or Miss USA pageants on its networks.[190] In September 2015, Trump bought NBC's share of the Miss Universe Organization and then sold the entire company to the WME/IMG talent agency.[191]\n\nTrump University\n\nTrump University was a for-profit education company that was founded by Trump and his associates, Michael Sexton and Jonathan Spitalny. The company ran a real estate training program and charged between $1,500 and $35,000 per course.[192][193][194] In 2005, New York State authorities notified the operation that its use of the word \"university\" was misleading and violated state law. After a second such notification in 2010, the name of the company was changed to the \"Trump Entrepreneurial Institute\".[195] Trump was also found personally liable for failing to obtain a business license for the operation.[196]\n\nRonald Schneckenberg, a sales manager for Trump University, said in a testimony that he was reprimanded for not trying harder to sell a $35,000 real estate class to a couple who could not afford it.[197] Schneckenberg said that he believed \"Trump University was a fraudulent scheme\" which \"preyed upon the elderly and uneducated to separate them from their money.\"[197]\n\nIn 2013, New York State filed a $40 million civil suit against Trump University; the suit alleged that the company made false statements and defrauded consumers.[195][198] In addition, two class-action civil lawsuits were filed in federal court relating to Trump University; they named Trump personally as well as his companies.[199] During the presidential campaign, Trump criticized presiding Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel, alleging bias in his rulings because of his Mexican heritage.[200][201] Shortly after Trump won the presidency, the parties agreed to a settlement of all three pending cases, whereby Trump paid a total of $25 million and denied any wrongdoing.[202][203]\n\nFoundation\n\nThe Donald J. Trump Foundation is a U.S.-based private foundation[204] that was established in 1988 for the initial purpose of giving away proceeds from the book Trump: The Art of the Deal.[205][206] The foundation's funds have mostly come from donors other than Trump,[207] who has not given personally to the charity since 2008.[207]\n\nThe foundation's tax returns show that it has given to health care and sports-related charities, as well as conservative groups.[208] In 2009, for example, the foundation gave $926,750 to about 40 groups, with the biggest donations going to the Arnold Palmer Medical Center Foundation ($100,000), the New York\u2013Presbyterian Hospital ($125,000), the Police Athletic League ($156,000), and the Clinton Foundation ($100,000).[209][210] From 2004 to 2014, the top donors to the foundation were Vince and Linda McMahon of WWE, who donated $5 million to the foundation after Trump appeared at WrestleMania in 2007.[207] Trump later named Linda McMahon as Administrator of the Small Business Administration.[211]\n\nIn 2016, The Washington Post reported that the charity had committed several potential legal and ethical violations, including alleged self-dealing and possible tax evasion.[212] Also in 2016, the New York State Attorney General's office notified the Trump Foundation that the foundation appeared to be in violation of New York laws regarding charities, ordering it to immediately cease its fundraising activities in New York.[213][214][215] A Trump spokesman called the Attorney General's investigation a \"partisan hit job\".[213] In response to mounting complaints, Trump's team announced in late December 2016 that the Trump Foundation would be dissolved to remove \"even the appearance of any conflict with [his] role as President.\"[216] According to an IRS filing in November 2017, the foundation intended to shut down and distribute its assets (about $970,000) to other charities. However, the New York Attorney General's office had to complete their ongoing investigation before the foundation could legally shut down,[217] and in June 2018 they filed a civil suit against the foundation for $2.8 million in restitution and additional penalties.[218] The suit names Trump himself as well as his adult children Donald Jr., Eric, and Ivanka.[219]\n\nConflicts of interest\n\nBefore being inaugurated as president, Trump moved his businesses into a revocable trust run by his eldest sons and a business associate.[220][221] According to ethics experts, as long as Trump continues to profit from his businesses, the measures taken by Trump do not help to avoid conflicts of interest.[222] Because Trump would have knowledge of how his administration's policies would affect his businesses, ethics experts recommend that Trump sell off his businesses.[221] Multiple lawsuits have been filed alleging that Trump is violating the emoluments clause of the United States Constitution due to his business interests; they argue that these interests allow foreign governments to influence him.[222][223] Previous presidents in the modern era have either divested their holdings or put them in blind trusts,[220] and he is the first president to be sued over the emoluments clause.[223]\n\nMedia career\n\nBooks\n\nTrump has published numerous books. His first published book in 1987 was Trump: The Art of the Deal, in which Trump is credited as co-author with Tony Schwartz, who has stated that he did all the writing for the book.[224][225][226] It reached number 1 on The New York Times Best Seller list, stayed there for 13 weeks, and altogether held a position on the list for 48 weeks.[225] According to The New Yorker, \"The book expanded Trump's renown far beyond New York City, promoting an image of himself as a successful dealmaker and tycoon.\"[225] Trump's published writings shifted post-2000 from stylized memoirs to financial tips and political opinion.[227]\n\nFilm and television\n\nWrestling\n\nIn 1988 and 1989, Trump hosted WrestleMania IV and V at Boardwalk Hall, and he has been an active participant in several World Wrestling shows.[228] In 2013, he was inducted into the celebrity wing of the WWE Hall of Fame at Madison Square Garden for his contributions to the promotion.[229]\n\nThe Apprentice\n\nIn 2003, Trump became the executive producer and host of the NBC reality show The Apprentice, in which contestants competed for a one-year management job with the Trump Organization; applicants were successively eliminated from the game with the catchphrase \"You're fired\".[230][224][231] He went on to be co-host of The Celebrity Apprentice, in which celebrities compete to win money for their charities.[230][231][232]\n\nIn February 2015, Trump stated that he was \"not ready\" to sign on for another season of the show because of the possibility of a presidential run.[233] Despite this, NBC announced they were going ahead with production of a 15th season.[234] In June, after widespread negative reaction stemming from Trump's campaign announcement speech, NBC released a statement saying, \"Due to the recent derogatory statements by Donald Trump regarding immigrants, NBCUniversal is ending its business relationship with Mr. Trump.\"[235]\n\nIn 2011, Trump was given a weekly unpaid guest commentator spot on Fox & Friends that continued for years.[236][237][238]\n\nActing\n\nTrump has made cameo appearances in 12 films and 14 television series,[239] including a cameo as one of the characters' father in The Little Rascals.[240][241] He performed a song with Megan Mullally at the 57th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2005.[242][243]\n\nTrump receives a pension as a member of the Screen Actors Guild.[244] His financial disclosure forms mentioned an annual pension of $110,000 in 2016 and $85,000 in 2017.[244][245][246]\n\nPublic profile\n\nApproval ratings\n\nPresidential approval polls taken during the first ten months of Trump's term have shown him to be the least popular U.S. president in the history of modern opinion polls.[247][248][249] A Pew Research Center global poll conducted in July 2017, found \"a median of just 22 percent has confidence in Trump to do the right thing when it comes to international affairs\". This compares to a median of 64 percent rate of confidence for his predecessor Barack Obama. Trump received a higher rating in only two countries: Russia and Israel.[250] An August 2017 POLITICO/Morning consult poll found on some measures \"that majorities of voters have low opinions of his character and competence\".[251] Trump is the only elected president who did not place first on Gallup's poll of men Americans most admired in his first year in office, coming in second behind Barack Obama.[252][253]\n\nFalse statements\n\nAs president, Trump has frequently made false statements in public speeches and remarks.[254][255][256][257]\n\nTrump uttered \"at least one false or misleading claim per day on 91 of his first 99 days\" in office according to The New York Times,[254] and 1,318 total in his first 263 days in office according to the \"Fact Checker\" political analysis column of The Washington Post,[258] which also wrote, \"President Trump is the most fact-challenged politician that The Fact Checker has ever encountered ... the pace and volume of the president's misstatements means that we cannot possibly keep up.\"[255] After 558 days in office, the tally was at 4,229 false or misleading claims, and it had risen to an average of 7.6 per day from 4.9 during Trump's first 100 days in office.[259] According to one study, the rate of false statements has increased, with the percentage of his words that are part of a false claim rising over the course of his presidency.[257] In general, news organizations have been hesitant to label these statements as \"lies\".[260][261][257]\n\nRacial views\n\nTrump has a history of making racially controversial remarks and taking actions that are perceived as racially motivated.[262] In 1975, he settled a 1973 Department of Justice lawsuit that alleged housing discrimination against black renters.[95][263][264] He was accused of racism for insisting that a group of black and Latino teenagers were guilty of raping a white woman in the 1989 Central Park jogger attack, even after they were exonerated by DNA evidence in 2002. He continued to maintain this position as late as 2016.[265]\n\nStarting in 2011, Trump was a major proponent of \"birther\" conspiracy theories alleging that Barack Obama was born in Kenya, and questioned his eligibility to serve as president.[266][267] Trump later took credit for pushing the White House to release the \"long-form\" birth certificate from Hawaii,[268][269][270] and he stated during his presidential campaign that his stance had made him \"very popular\".[271] In September 2016, he publicly acknowledged that Obama was born in the United States,[272] and falsely claimed that the rumors had been started by Hillary Clinton during her 2008 campaign.[273]\n\nTrump makes a statement (begins at 07:20 into the video) on the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville published by the White House\n\nTrump launched his 2016 presidential campaign with a speech in which he stated: \"When Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. ... They're bringing drugs, they're bringing crime, they're rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.\"[274][275][276][277] Later, his attacks on a Mexican-American judge were criticized as racist.[278] His comments following a 2017 far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, were seen as implying a moral equivalence between white supremacist marchers and those who protested them.[279] In a January 2018 Oval Office meeting to discuss immigration legislation with Congressional leaders, Trump reportedly referred to El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, and African countries as \"shitholes\".[280] His remarks were condemned as racist worldwide, as well as by many members of Congress.[281][282][283] Trump has denied accusations of racism multiple times, saying he is the \"least racist person\".[284][285]\n\nTrump's racially insensitive statements[263] have been condemned by many observers in the U.S. and around the world,[286][287] but accepted by his supporters either as a rejection of political correctness[288][289] or because they harbor similar racial sentiments.[290][291] Several studies and surveys have stated that racist attitudes and racial resentment have fueled Trump's political ascendance, and have become more significant than economic factors in determining party allegiance of voters.[291][292] According to an October 2017 Politico/Morning Consult poll, 45 percent of American voters viewed Trump as racist and 40 percent did not.[293] In a June 2018 Quinnipiac University poll, 49 percent of respondents believed that Trump is racist while 47 percent believed he is not. Additionally, 55 percent said he \"has emboldened people who hold racist beliefs to express those beliefs publicly.\"[294][295]\n\nRelationship with the press\n\nPresident Trump talking to the press, March 2017\n\nThroughout his career, Trump has sought media attention. His interactions with the press turned into what some sources called a \"love-hate\" relationship.[296][297][298] According to biographer Michael D'Antonio, Trump began promoting himself in the press in the 1970s.[299]\n\nDuring his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump accused the press of intentionally misinterpreting his words and of being biased, although he[300][301] benefited from a record amount of free media coverage, elevating his standing in the Republican primaries.[302] According to journalist Lesley Stahl, after Trump won the 2016 presidential election, he had told her that he kept attacking the media to \"demean\" and \"discredit\", \"so when you write negative stories about me no one will believe you\".[303] Into his presidency, much of the press coverage of Trump and his administration was negative.[304][305]\n\nTrump has often referred to the press as \"fake news media\" and \"the enemy of the people\".[306] He has privately and publicly mused about taking away critical reporters' White House press credentials (despite, during his campaign, promising not to do so once he became president).[307] On his first day in office, Trump falsely accused journalists of understating the size of the crowd at his inauguration, and called the media \"among the most dishonest human beings on earth\".\n\nThe relationship between Trump, the media, and fake news has been studied. One study found that between October 7 and November 14, 2016, while one in four Americans visited a fake news website, \"Trump supporters visited the most fake news websites, which were overwhelmingly pro-Trump\" and \"almost 6 in 10 visits to fake news websites came from the 10 percent of people with the most conservative online information diets\".[308][309] Brendan Nyhan, one of the authors of the study by researchers from Princeton University, Dartmouth College, and the University of Exeter, stated in an interview on NBC News: \"People got vastly more misinformation from Donald Trump than they did from fake news websites\".[310]\n\nPopular culture\n\nTrump has been the subject of comedians, flash cartoon artists, and online caricature artists. He has been parodied regularly on Saturday Night Live by Phil Hartman, Darrell Hammond, and Alec Baldwin, and in South Park as Mr. Garrison. The Simpsons episode \"Bart to the Future\", written during his 2000 campaign for the Reform party, anticipated a future Trump presidency. A dedicated parody series called The President Show debuted in April 2017 on Comedy Central, while another one called Our Cartoon President debuted on Showtime in February 2018.[311]\n\nStarting in the 1990s, Trump was a guest about 24 times on the nationally syndicated Howard Stern Show on talk radio. Trump also had his own daily talk radio program called Trumped!, from 2004 to 2008.[314][315] Trump's wealth and lifestyle had been a fixture of hip hop lyrics since the 1980s, as he was named in hundreds of songs, most often in a positive tone.[316][317] Mentions of Trump turned negative and pejorative after he ran for office in 2015.[316][318][319]\n\nSocial media\n\nTrump's presence on social media has attracted attention worldwide since he joined Twitter in March 2009. He communicated heavily on Twitter during the 2016 election campaign, and has continued to use this channel during his presidency. The attention on Trump's Twitter activity has significantly increased since he was sworn in as president. He uses Twitter as a direct means of communication with the public, sidelining the press.[320] Many of the assertions he tweeted have been proven false.[321][322][323]\n\nRecognitions\n\nIn December 2016, Time named Trump as its \"Person of the Year\".[324] In an interview on The Today Show, he said he was honored by the award, but he took issue with the magazine for referring to him as the \"President of the Divided States of America.\"[325][326] In the same month, he was named Financial Times Person of the Year.[327] In December 2016, Forbes ranked Trump the second most powerful person in the world, after Vladimir Putin and before Angela Merkel.[328] In 2015, Robert Gordon University revoked the honorary Doctor of Business Administration (DBA) it had granted Trump in 2010, stating that \"Mr. Trump has made a number of statements that are wholly incompatible with the ethos and values of the university.\"[329]\n\nPolitical career\n\nPolitical activities up to 2015\n\nTrump's political party affiliation has changed numerous times over the years. He was a Democrat prior to 1987, when he registered as a Republican in Manhattan.[330] He switched to Independent in 1999, Democrat in 2001, and back to Republican in 2009.[330]\n\nIn 1987 Trump spent almost $100,000 (equivalent to $215,407 in 2017) to place full-page advertisements in three major newspapers, proclaiming that \"America should stop paying to defend countries that can afford to defend themselves\".[331] The advertisements also advocated for \"reducing the budget deficit, working for peace in Central America, and speeding up nuclear disarmament negotiations with the Soviet Union.\"[332] After rumors of a presidential run, Trump was invited by Democratic senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, and Arkansas congressman Beryl Anthony Jr., to host a fundraising dinner for Democratic Congressional candidates and to switch parties. Anthony told The New York Times that \"the message Trump has been preaching is a Democratic message\". Asked whether the rumors were true, Trump denied being a candidate, but said, \"I believe that if I did run for President, I'd win.\"[332] According to a Gallup poll in December 1988, Trump was the tenth most admired man in America, behind Ted Kennedy and Bill Cosby.\n\n2000 presidential campaign\n\nIn 1999, Trump filed an exploratory committee to seek the nomination of the Reform Party for the 2000 presidential election.[335][336] A July 1999 poll matching him against likely Republican nominee George W. Bush and likely Democratic nominee Al Gore showed Trump with seven percent support.[337] Trump eventually dropped out of the race, but still went on to win the Reform Party primaries in California and Michigan.[338][339] After his run, Trump left the party due to the involvement of David Duke, Pat Buchanan, and Lenora Fulani.[335] Trump also considered running for president in 2004.[340] In 2005, Trump said that he voted for George W. Bush.[341] In 2008, he endorsed Republican John McCain for president.[342]\n\n2012 presidential speculation\n\nTrump publicly speculated about running for president in the 2012 election, and made his first speaking appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February 2011. The speech is credited for helping kick-start his political career within the Republican Party.[343] On May 16, 2011, Trump announced he would not run for president in the 2012 election.[344] In February 2012, Trump endorsed Mitt Romney for president.[345]\n\nTrump's presidential ambitions were generally not taken seriously at the time.[346] Trump's moves were interpreted by some media as possible promotional tools for his reality show The Apprentice.[344][347][348] Before the 2016 election, The New York Times speculated that Trump \"accelerated his ferocious efforts to gain stature within the political world\" after Obama lampooned him at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner in April 2011.[349]\n\n2013\u20132015\n\nIn 2013, Trump was a featured CPAC speaker.[350] In a sparsely-attended speech, he railed against illegal immigration while seeming to encourage immigration from Europe, bemoaned Obama's \"unprecedented media protection\", advised against harming Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, and suggested that the government \"take\" Iraq's oil and use the proceeds to pay a million dollars each to families of dead soldiers.[351][352] He spent over $1 million that year to research a possible 2016 candidacy.[353]\n\nIn October 2013, New York Republicans circulated a memo suggesting Trump should run for governor of the state in 2014 against Andrew Cuomo. Trump responded that while New York had problems and its taxes were too high, he was not interested in the governorship.[354] A February 2014 Quinnipiac poll had shown Trump losing to the more popular Cuomo by 37 points in a hypothetical election.[355] In February 2015, Trump told NBC that he was not prepared to sign on for another season of The Apprentice, as he mulled his political future.[356]\n\n2016 Republican presidential primaries\n\nOn June 16, 2015, Trump announced his candidacy for President of the United States at Trump Tower in Manhattan. In the speech, Trump discussed illegal immigration, offshoring of American jobs, the U.S. national debt, and Islamic terrorism, which all remained large priorities during the campaign. He also announced his campaign slogan: \"Make America Great Again\".[275][274] Trump said his wealth would make him immune to pressure from campaign donors.[357] He declared that he was funding his own campaign,[358] but according to The Atlantic, \"Trump's claims of self-funding have always been dubious at best and actively misleading at worst.\"[359]\n\nIn the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries, Trump entered a field of 17 major candidates who were vying for the 2016 Republican nomination; this was the largest presidential field in American history.[360] Trump's campaign was initially not taken seriously by political analysts, but he quickly rose to the top of opinion polls.[361]\n\nOn Super Tuesday, Trump won the plurality of the vote, and he remained the front-runner throughout the remainder of the primaries. By March 2016, Trump became poised to win the Republican nomination.[362] After a landslide win in Indiana on May 3, 2016\u2014which prompted the remaining candidates Cruz and John Kasich to suspend their presidential campaigns\u2014RNC Chairman Reince Priebus declared Trump the presumptive Republican nominee.[363]\n\n2016 general election campaign\n\nAfter becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, Trump shifted his focus to the general election. Trump began campaigning against Hillary Clinton, who became the presumptive Democratic nominee on June 6, 2016.\n\nClinton had established a significant lead over Trump in national polls throughout most of 2016. In early July, Clinton's lead narrowed in national polling averages following the FBI's re-opening of its investigation into her ongoing email controversy.[364][365][366]\n\nOn July 15, 2016, Trump announced his selection of Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate.[367] Four days later on July 19, Trump and Pence were officially nominated by the Republican Party at the Republican National Convention.[368] The list of convention speakers and attendees included former presidential nominee Bob Dole, but the other prior nominees did not attend.[369][370]\n\nTwo days later, Trump officially accepted the nomination in a 76-minute speech. The historically long speech received mixed reviews, with net negative viewer reactions according to CNN and Gallup polls.[371][372][373]\n\nOn September 26, 2016, Trump and Clinton faced off in their first presidential debate, which was held at Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, and moderated by NBC News anchor Lester Holt.[374] The TV broadcast was the most watched presidential debate in United States history.[375] The second presidential debate was held at Washington University in Saint Louis, Missouri. The beginning of that debate was dominated by references to a recently leaked tape of Trump making sexually explicit comments, which Trump countered by referring to alleged sexual misconduct on the part of Bill Clinton. Prior to the debate, Trump had invited four women who had accused Clinton of impropriety to a press conference. The final presidential debate was held on October 19 at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Trump's refusal to say whether he would accept the result of the election, regardless of the outcome, drew particular attention, with some saying it undermined democracy.[376][377]\n\nPolitical positions\n\nTrump's campaign platform emphasized renegotiating U.S.\u2013China relations and free trade agreements such as NAFTA and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, strongly enforcing immigration laws, and building a new wall along the U.S.\u2013Mexico border. His other campaign positions included pursuing energy independence while opposing climate change regulations such as the Clean Power Plan and the Paris Agreement, modernizing and expediting services for veterans, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, abolishing Common Core education standards, investing in infrastructure, simplifying the tax code while reducing taxes for all economic classes, and imposing tariffs on imports by companies that offshore jobs. During the campaign, he also advocated a largely non-interventionist approach to foreign policy while increasing military spending, extreme vetting or banning immigrants from Muslim-majority countries[378] to pre-empt domestic Islamic terrorism, and aggressive military action against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.\n\nHis political positions have been described as populist,[379][380][381] and some of his views cross party lines. For example, his economic campaign plan calls for large reductions in income taxes and deregulation,[382] consistent with Republican Party policies, along with significant infrastructure investment,[383] usually considered a Democratic Party policy.[384][385] According to political writer Jack Shafer, Trump may be a \"fairly conventional American populist when it comes to his policy views\", but he attracts free media attention, sometimes by making outrageous comments.[386]\n\nTrump has supported or leaned toward varying political positions over time.[388][389][390] Politico has described his positions as \"eclectic, improvisational and often contradictory\",[390] while NBC News counted \"141 distinct shifts on 23 major issues\" during his campaign.[391]\n\nCampaign rhetoric\n\nIn his campaign, Trump said that he disdained political correctness; he also stated that the media had intentionally misinterpreted his words, and he made other claims of adverse media bias.[300][392][301] In part due to his fame, and due to his willingness to say things other candidates would not, and because a candidate who is gaining ground automatically provides a compelling news story, Trump received an unprecedented amount of free media coverage during his run for the presidency, which elevated his standing in the Republican primaries.[302]\n\nFact-checking organizations have denounced Trump for making a record number of false statements compared to other candidates.[393][394][395] At least four major publications\u2014Politico, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and the Los Angeles Times\u2014have pointed out lies or falsehoods in his campaign statements, with the Los Angeles Times saying that \"Never in modern presidential politics has a major candidate made false statements as routinely as Trump has\".[396] NPR said that Trump's campaign statements were often opaque or suggestive.[397]\n\nTrump's penchant for hyperbole is believed to have roots in the New York real estate scene, where Trump established his wealth and where puffery abounds.[398] Trump has called his public speaking style \"truthful hyperbole\", an effective political tactic that may, however, backfire for overpromising.[398]\n\nWhite supremacist support\n\nActs of populism that proved successful for Trump included recognition of some Americans who felt \"anger\" towards cultural changes, sexual liberty and the potential of white Americans\u2013especially white Protestants\u2013becoming a minority group in the United States.[379] According to Michael Barkun, the Trump campaign was remarkable for bringing fringe ideas, beliefs, and organizations into the mainstream.[399]\n\nDuring his presidential campaign, Trump was accused of pandering to white supremacists.[400][401][402] He retweeted open racists,[403][404] and repeatedly refused to condemn David Duke, the Ku Klux Klan or white supremacists, in an interview on CNN's State of the Union, saying that he would first need to \"do research\" because he knew nothing about Duke or white supremacists.[405][406] Trump has said that he disavowed David Duke and the KKK on multiple occasions.[407][408][409] Duke himself was an enthusiastic supporter of Trump throughout the 2016 primary and election, and has stated that he and like-minded people voted for Trump because of his promises to \"take our country back\".[410] In a tweet he reminded Trump that \"it was White Americans who put you in the presidency\".[411]\n\nThe alt-right movement coalesced around Trump's candidacy,[412] due in part to its opposition to multiculturalism and immigration.[413][414][415] Members of the alt-right enthusiastically supported Trump's campaign.[416] In August 2016, he appointed Steve Bannon\u2014the executive chairman of Breitbart News\u2014as his campaign CEO; Bannon described Breitbart News as \"the platform for the alt-right.\"[417] Trump personally condemned the alt-right in an interview after the election.[418]\n\nFinancial disclosures\n\nAs a presidential candidate, Trump disclosed details of his companies, assets, and revenue sources to the extent required by the FEC. His 2015 report listed assets above $1.4 billion and outstanding debts of at least $265 million.[90][419] The 2016 form showed little change.[91]\n\nTrump did not release his tax returns during his presidential campaign or afterward,[420][421] contrary to usual practice by every candidate since Gerald Ford in 1976 and to his promise in 2014 to do so if he ran for office.[422][423][424] Trump's refusal led to speculation that he was hiding something.[425] He said that his tax returns were being audited, and his lawyers had advised him against releasing them.[426][427] Trump has told the press that his tax rate was none of their business, and that he tries to pay \"as little tax as possible\".[428][429][430]\n\nIn October 2016, portions of Trump's state filings for 1995 were leaked to a reporter from The New York Times. They show that Trump declared a loss of $916 million that year, which could have let him avoid taxes for up to 18 years. During the second presidential debate, Trump acknowledged using the deduction, but declined to provide details such as the specific years it was applied.[431] He said that he did use the tax code to avoid paying taxes.[432][433][434]\n\nOn March 14, 2017, the first two pages of Trump's 2005 federal income tax returns were leaked to Rachel Maddow and shown on MSNBC. The document states that Trump had a gross adjusted income of $150 million and paid $38 million in federal taxes. The White House confirmed the authenticity of these documents and stated: \"Despite this substantial income figure and tax paid, it is totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns.\"[435][436]\n\nSexual misconduct allegations\n\nA total of 19 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct as of December 2017 .[437] Trump and his campaign have denied as of October 2016 all of the sexual misconduct accusations, which Trump has called \"false smears\", and alleged a conspiracy against him.[438][439][440]\n\nTwo days before the second presidential debate, a 2005 recording surfaced in which Trump was heard bragging about forcibly kissing and groping women.[441][442][443] The hot mic recording was captured on a studio bus in which Trump and Billy Bush were preparing to film an episode of Access Hollywood. In the tape, Trump said: \"I just start kissing them ... I don't even wait. And when you're a star, they let you do it, you can do anything ... grab 'em by the pussy.\"[444] During the recording, Trump also spoke of his efforts to seduce a married woman, saying he \"moved on her very heavily\".[444]\n\nTrump's language on the tape was described by the media as \"vulgar\", \"sexist\", and descriptive of sexual assault. The incident prompted him to make his first public apology during the campaign,[445][446] and caused outrage across the political spectrum,[447][448] with many Republicans withdrawing their endorsements of his candidacy and some urging him to quit the race.[449] Subsequently, at least 15 women[450] came forward with new accusations of sexual misconduct, including unwanted kissing and groping, resulting in widespread media coverage.[451][452] In his two public statements in response to the controversy, Trump alleged that former president Bill Clinton had \"abused women\" and that Hillary had bullied her husband's victims.[453]\n\nElection to the presidency\n\n2016 electoral vote results\n\nOn November 8, 2016, Trump received 306 pledged electoral votes versus 232 for Clinton. The official counts were 304 and 227 respectively, after defections on both sides.[454] Trump received a smaller share of the popular vote than Clinton, which made him the fifth person to be elected president while losing the popular vote.[455][nb 3] Clinton was ahead nationwide by 2.1 percentage points, with 65,853,514 votes (7001481800000000000\u266048.18%) to 62,984,828 votes (7001460900000000000\u266046.09%); neither candidate reached a majority.[458]\n\nTrump's victory was considered a stunning political upset by most observers, as polls had consistently showed Hillary Clinton with a nationwide\u2014though diminishing\u2014lead, as well as a favorable advantage in most of the competitive states. Trump's support had been modestly underestimated throughout his campaign,[459] and many observers blamed errors in polls, partially attributed to pollsters overestimating Clinton's support among well-educated and nonwhite voters, while underestimating Trump's support among white working-class voters.[460] Actually, the polls were relatively accurate,[461] but media outlets and pundits alike showed overconfidence in a Clinton victory despite a large number of undecided voters and a favorable concentration of Trump's core constituencies in competitive states.[462]\n\nTrump won 30 states, including Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, which had been called a blue wall of Democratic strongholds since the 1990s. Clinton won 20 states and the District of Columbia. Trump's victory marked the return of a Republican White House combined with control of both chambers of Congress.\n\nTrump is the wealthiest president in U.S. history, even after adjusting for inflation.[463] He is also the first president without prior government or military service.[464][465][466] Of the 43[nb 4] previous presidents, 38 had held prior elective office, two had not held elective office but had served in the Cabinet, and three had never held public office but had been commanding generals.[466]\n\nProtests\n\nWomen's March in Washington on January 21, 2017, a day after the inauguration\n\nSome rallies during the primary season were accompanied by protests or violence, including attacks on Trump supporters and vice versa both inside and outside the venues.[468][469][470] Trump's election victory sparked protests across the United States, in opposition to his policies and his inflammatory statements. Trump initially said on Twitter that these were \"professional protesters, incited by the media\", and were \"unfair\", but he later tweeted, \"Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country.\"[471][472]\n\nIn the weeks following Trump's inauguration, massive anti-Trump demonstrations took place, such as the Women Marches, which gathered 2,600,000 people worldwide,[473] including 500,000 in Washington alone.[474] Moreover, marches against his travel ban began across the country on January 29, 2017, just 9 days after his inauguration.[475]\n\nOther legal affairs\n\nAdult film actress Stormy Daniels has alleged that she and Trump had an affair in 2006,[476] which Trump denied.[477] Just before the 2016 presidential election Daniels was paid $130,000 by Trump's attorney Michael Cohen as part of a non-disclosure agreement (NDA); Cohen said he paid her with his own money.[478] In February 2018, Daniels sued Cohen's company asking to be released from the NDA and be allowed to tell her story. Cohen obtained a restraining order to keep her from discussing the case.[479][480] In March, Daniels claimed in court that the NDA never came into effect because Trump did not sign it personally.[481] In April, Trump said that he did not know about Cohen paying Daniels, why Cohen had made the payment or where Cohen got the money from.[482] In May, Trump's annual financial disclosure revealed that he reimbursed Cohen in 2017 for payments related to Daniels.[483] In August 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to breaking campaign finance laws, admitting to paying hush money of $130,000 to Daniels and $150,000 indirectly to Playboy model Karen McDougal, and said that he did it at the direction of Trump,[484][485] with the aim of influencing the presidential election.[486] In response, Trump said that he only knew about the payments \"later on\", and that he paid back Cohen personally, not out of campaign funds.[487] Cohen also said he would cooperate fully with the Special Counsel investigation into collusion with Russia.[488]\n\nPresidency\n\nEarly actions\n\nTrump was inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States on January 20, 2017. During his first week in office, he signed six executive orders: interim procedures in anticipation of repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, re-instatement of the Mexico City Policy, unlocking the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Pipeline construction projects, reinforcing border security, and beginning the planning and design process to construct a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico.[489]\n\nOn January 31, Trump nominated U.S. Appeals Court judge Neil Gorsuch to fill the seat on the Supreme Court previous held by Justice Antonin Scalia until his death in 2016.[490]\n\nDomestic policy\n\nTrade tariffs\n\nTrump has been described as a protectionist[491][492][493] because he criticized NAFTA,[494][495] cancelled negotiations towards the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP),[496] imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum,[497][498] and proposed to significantly raise tariffs on Chinese and Mexican exports to the United States.[499][500] He has also been critical of the World Trade Organization, threatening to leave unless his proposed tariffs are accepted.[501][502]\n\nIn March 2018, Trump signed an order imposing import tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum, with exemptions for Canada, Mexico, and possibly other countries.[503] In response, the EU imposed retaliatory tariffs targeting $3.4 billion in U.S. exports.[504][505] In July, China retaliated with a $34 billion in tariffs on U.S. goods.[506][507] Trump had signaled that he might impose an additional $200 billion in tariffs if China imposed their own tariffs, with the potential for a further $200 billion, in an escalating trade war[508] that analysts say could impact $2 trillion in global trade.[509][510]\n\nEconomy\n\nTrump speaking to automobile workers in Michigan, March 2017\n\nIn December 2017, Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which cut the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, lowered personal tax brackets, increased child tax credit, doubled the estate tax threshold to $11.2 million, and limited the state and local tax deduction to $10,000.[511] The reduction in individual tax rates ends in 2025. While people would generally get a tax cut, those with higher incomes would see the most benefit.[512][513] Households in the lower or middle class would also see a small tax increase after the tax cuts expire. The bill is estimated to increase deficits by $1.5 trillion over 10 years.[514][515]\n\nEnergy and climate\n\nWhile campaigning Trump's energy policy advocated domestic support for both fossil and renewable energy sources in order to curb reliance on Middle-Eastern oil and possibly turn the U.S. into a net energy exporter.[516] However following his election his \"America First Energy Plan\" did not mention renewable energy and instead focused on fossil fuels.[517] Environmentalists have expressed concerns because he has announced plans to make large budget cuts in programs that research renewable energy and to roll back Obama-era policies directed at curbing climate change and limiting environmental pollution.[518]\n\nTrump rejects the scientific consensus on climate change[519][520] and his former Environmental Protection Agency chief, Scott Pruitt, does not believe that carbon emissions are the main cause of global warming. While admitting that the climate is warming, Pruitt believes that warming is not necessarily harmful and could be beneficial.[521] Based on numerous studies, climate experts disagree with his position.[522] On June 1, 2017, Trump announced the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement, making the U.S. the only nation in the world to not ratify the agreement.[523][524][525]\n\nGovernment size and deregulation\n\nTrump's early policies have favored rollback and dismantling of government regulations. He signed a Congressional Review Act disapproval resolution, the first in 16 years and second overall.[526] During his first six weeks in office, he abolished ninety federal regulations.[527][528]\n\nOn January 23, 2017, Trump ordered a temporary government-wide hiring freeze, except for those working in certain areas.[529][530] The Comptroller General of the Government Accountability Office told a House committee that hiring freezes have not proven to be effective in reducing costs.[531] Unlike some past freezes, the current freeze bars agencies from adding contractors to make up for employees leaving.[531] A week later Trump signed Executive Order 13771, which directed administrative agencies to repeal two existing regulations for every new regulation they issue.[532][533] Agency defenders expressed opposition to Trump's criticisms, saying that the bureaucracy exists to protect people against well-organized, well-funded interest groups.[534]\n\nHealth care\n\nIn 1999, Trump told Larry King Live: \"I believe in universal healthcare.\"[535] Trump's 2000 book, The America We Deserve, argued strongly for a single-payer healthcare system based on the Canadian model,[536] and he has voiced admiration for the Scottish National Health Service.[535][537][538]\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump repeatedly vowed to repeal and replace Obamacare.[539][540] Shortly after taking office, he urged Congress to repeal and replace it. In May of that year, the United States House of Representatives voted to repeal the ACA.[541] Over the course of several months' effort, however, the Senate was unable to pass any version of a repeal bill.[542] Trump has expressed a desire to \"let Obamacare fail\", and the Trump administration has cut the ACA enrollment period in half and drastically reduced funding for advertising and other ways to encourage enrollment.[543][544][545] The tax reform Trump signed into law at the end of his first year in office effectively repealed the individual health insurance mandate that was a major element of the Obamacare health insurance system; this repeal is scheduled to be implemented in 2019.[546][547][548]\n\nSocial issues\n\nTrump favored changing the 2016 Republican platform to affirm women's right to abortion in the three exceptional cases of rape, incest, and circumstances endangering the health of the mother.[549] He has said that he is committed to appointing pro-life justices.[550] He personally supports \"traditional marriage\"[551] but considers the nationwide legality of same-sex marriage a \"settled\" issue.[550]\n\nTrump supports a broad interpretation of the Second Amendment and says he is opposed to gun control in general,[552][553] although his views have shifted over time.[554] Trump opposes legalizing recreational marijuana but supports legalizing medical marijuana.[555] He favors capital punishment,[556][557] as well as the use of waterboarding and \"a hell of a lot worse\" methods.[558][559]\n\nImmigration\n\nTrump conferring with Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly , January 25, 2017\n\nTrump's proposed immigration policies were a topic of bitter and contentious debate during the campaign. He promised to build a more substantial wall on the Mexico\u2013United States border to keep out illegal immigrants and vowed that Mexico would pay for it.[560] He pledged to massively deport illegal immigrants residing in the United States,[561] and criticized birthright citizenship for creating \"anchor babies\".[562] He said that deportation would focus on criminals, visa overstays, and security threats.[563]\n\nTravel ban\n\nFollowing the November 2015 Paris attacks, Trump made a controversial proposal to ban Muslim foreigners from entering the United States until stronger vetting systems could be implemented.[564][565][566] He later reframed the proposed ban to apply to countries with a \"proven history of terrorism\".[567][568][569]\n\nOn January 27, 2017, Trump signed Executive Order 13769, which suspended admission of refugees for 120 days and denied entry to citizens of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for 90 days, citing security concerns. The order was imposed without warning and took effect immediately.[570] Confusion and protests caused chaos at airports.[571][572] The administration then clarified that visitors with a green card were exempt from the ban.[573][574]\n\nOn January 30, Sally Yates, the acting Attorney General, directed Justice Department lawyers not to defend the executive order, which she deemed unenforceable and unconstitutional;[575] Trump immediately dismissed her.[576][577] Multiple legal challenges were filed against the order, and on February 5 a federal judge in Seattle blocked its implementation.[578][579] On March 6, Trump issued a revised order, which excluded Iraq, gave specific exemptions for permanent residents, and removed priorities for Christian minorities.[580][570] Again federal judges in three states blocked its implementation.[581] On June 26, 2017, the Supreme Court ruled that the ban could be enforced on visitors who lack a \"credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\"[582]\n\nThe temporary order was replaced by Presidential Proclamation 9645 on September 24, 2017, which permanently restricts travel from the originally targeted countries except Iraq and Sudan, and further bans travelers from North Korea and Chad, and certain Venezuelan officials.[583] After lower courts partially blocked the new restrictions with injunctions, the Supreme Court allowed the September version to go into full effect on December 4.[584] In January 2018, the Supreme Court announced that it would hear a challenge to the travel ban.[585] The Court heard oral arguments on April 25,[586][585] and ultimately upheld the travel ban in a June ruling.[587]\n\nDACA\n\nWhile running for president, Trump said that he intended to repeal the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) on \"day one\" of his presidency. The program, introduced in 2012, allowed people who had either entered or remained in the United States illegally as minors to receive a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation and be eligible for a work permit.[588]\n\nIn September 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the DACA program would be repealed after six months.[589] Trump argued that \"top legal experts\" believed that DACA was unconstitutional, and called on Congress to use the six-month delay to pass legislation solving the \"Dreamers\" issue permanently.[590] As of March 2018 , when the delay expired, no legislation had been agreed on DACA.[591] Several states immediately challenged the DACA rescission in court.[592] Two injunctions in January and February 2018 allowed renewals of applications and stopped the rolling back of DACA, and in April 2018 a federal judge ordered the acceptance of new applications; this would go into effect in 90 days.[593]\n\nFamily separation at border\n\nIn April 2018, Trump enacted a \"zero tolerance\" immigration policy that took adults irregularly entering the U.S. into custody for criminal prosecution and forcibly separated children from parents, eliminating the policy of previous administrations that made exceptions for families with children.[594][595] By mid-June, more than 2,300 children had been placed in shelters, including \"tender age\" shelters for babies and toddlers,[596] culminating in demands from Democrats, Republicans, Trump allies, and religious groups that the policy be rescinded.[597] Trump falsely asserted that his administration was merely following the law.[598][599][600] On June 20, Trump signed an executive order to end family separations at the U.S. border.[601] On June 26 a federal judge in San Diego issued a preliminary injunction requiring the Trump administration to stop detaining immigrants parents separately from their minor children, and to reunite family groups that had been separated at the border.[602]\n\nForeign policy\n\nPresident Trump together with other leaders at the 43rd G7 summit in Italy\n\nTrump has been described as a non-interventionist[603][604] and as an American Nationalist.[605] He has repeatedly stated that he supports his foreign policy \"America First\".[606] He supports increasing United States military defense spending,[605] but favors decreasing United States spending on NATO and in the Pacific region.[607] He says America should look inward, stop \"nation building\", and re-orient its resources toward domestic needs.[604]\n\nIn order to confront the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), Trump in 2015 called for seizing the oil in ISIS-occupied areas, using U.S. air power and ground troops.[608] In 2016, Trump advocated sending 20,000 to 30,000 U.S. troops to the region,[609] a position he later retracted.[610]\n\nTrump has praised China's President Xi Jinping,[611] Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte,[612] Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi,[613] Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan,[614] King Salman of Saudi Arabia[615] and Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.[616] On April 7, 2017, Trump ordered a missile strike against a Syrian airfield in retaliation for the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack.[617] On April 13, 2018, he announced missile strikes against the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, following a suspected chemical attack near Damascus.[618]\n\nTrump actively supported the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen against the Iran-backed Houthis and signed a $110 billion agreement to sell arms to Saudi Arabia.[619][620][621]\n\nIn November 2017, the Trump administration tightened the rules on trade with Cuba and individual visits to the county, undoing the Obama administration's loosening of restrictions. According to an administration official, the new rules were intended to hinder trade with businesses with ties to the Cuban military, intelligence and security services.[622]\n\nU.S. troop numbers in Afghanistan increased from 8,500 to 14,000, as of January 2017 .[623] reversing Trump's pre-election position critical of further involvement in Afghanistan.[624] U.S. officials said then that they aimed to \"force the Taliban to negotiate a political settlement\"; in January 2018, however, Trump spoke against talks with the Taliban.[625]\n\nIran\n\nDuring the campaign Trump maintained that \"Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East and on the road to nuclear weapons.\"[626] He opposed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA or \"Iran nuclear deal\") that was negotiated with the United States, Iran, and five other world powers in 2015, calling it \"terrible\" and saying that the Obama administration negotiated the agreement \"from desperation.\"[627] At one point he said that despite opposing the content of the deal, he would attempt to enforce it rather than abrogate it.[628] However, in a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) in March 2016, Trump said that his \"number-one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with Iran.\"[629]\n\nShortly after taking office, Trump put Iran 'on notice' following their ballistic missile tests on January 29, 2017.[630] In February 2018, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on Iran's 25 individuals and entities, which it said were but \"initial steps\", with Trump's National Security Advisor Michael T. Flynn adding that \"the days of turning a blind eye to Iran's hostile and belligerent actions toward the United States and the world community are over.\"[631][632][633]\n\nTrump reportedly lobbied \"dozens\" of European officials against doing business with Iran during the May 2017 Brussels summit; this likely violated the terms of the JCPOA, under which the U.S. may not pursue \"any policy specifically intended to directly and adversely affect the normalization of trade and economic relations with Iran.\" The Trump administration certified in July 2017 that Iran had upheld its end of the agreement.[634] On May 18, 2018, Trump announced the United States' unilateral departure from the JCPOA.[635]\n\nIsrael\n\nRegarding the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, Trump has stated the importance of being a neutral party during potential negotiations, while also having stated that he is \"a big fan of Israel\".[636] During the campaign he said he would relocate the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from its current location, Tel Aviv.[637] On May 22, 2017, Trump was the first U.S. president to visit the Western Wall in Jerusalem, during his first foreign trip, which included Israel, Italy, the Vatican, and Belgium.[638][639] Trump officially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on December 6, 2017, despite criticism and warnings from world leaders. Trump added that he would initiate the process of establishing a new U.S. embassy in Jerusalem,[640] which was later opened on May 14, 2018.[641] The United Nations General Assembly condemned the move, adopting a resolution that \"calls upon all States to refrain from the establishment of diplomatic missions in the Holy City of Jerusalem\" in an emergency session on December 21, 2017.[642][643]\n\nNATO\n\nAs a candidate Trump questioned whether he, as president, would automatically extend security guarantees to NATO members,[644] and suggested that he might leave NATO unless changes are made to the alliance.[645] As president, he reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to NATO in March 2017.[646] However, he has repeatedly accused fellow NATO members of paying less than their fair share of the expenses of the alliance.[647]\n\nNorth Korea\n\nDuring the campaign and the early months of his presidency, Trump said he hoped that China would help to rein in North Korea's nuclear ambitions and missile tests.[648] However, North Korea accelerated their missile and nuclear tests leading to increased tension.[648] In July, the country tested two long-range missiles identified by Western observers as intercontinental ballistic missiles, potentially capable of reaching Alaska, Hawaii, and the U.S. mainland.[649][650] In August, Trump dramatically escalated his rhetoric against North Korea, warning that further provocation against the U.S. would be met with \"fire and fury like the world has never seen.\"[651] North Korean leader Kim Jong-un then threatened to direct the country's next missile test toward Guam.[652]\n\nOn June 12, 2018, after several rounds of preliminary staff-level meetings, Trump and Kim held a bilateral summit in Singapore.[653] In a joint declaration, both countries vowed to \"join their efforts to build a lasting and stable peace regime on the Korean Peninsula\", while North Korea repeated its April 2018 promise to \"work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\"[654][655]\n\nRussia\n\nDuring his campaign and as president, Trump repeatedly said that he wants better relations with Russia,[656][657] and he has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a strong leader.[658][659] Trump had pledged to hold a summit meeting with Putin,[660] stating that Russia could help the U.S. in fighting ISIS.[661] According to Putin and some political experts and diplomats, the U.S.\u2013Russian relations, which were already at the lowest level since the end of the Cold War, have further deteriorated since Trump took office in January 2017.[662][663][664]\n\nTrump and Putin met in a 2018 Russia\u2013United States summit in Helsinki on July 16, 2018. Trump drew harsh bipartisan criticism in the United States for appearing to side with Putin's denial of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, rather than accepting the findings of the United States intelligence community.[665][666] His comments were strongly criticized by many congressional Republicans and most media commentators, even those who normally support him.[667][668]\n\nPersonnel\n\nThe Trump administration has been characterized by high turnover, particularly among White House staff. By the end of Trump's first year in office, 34 percent of his original staff had resigned, been fired, or been reassigned.[669] As of early July 2018 , 61 percent of Trump's senior aides had left[670] and 141 staffers had left in the past year.[671] Both figures set a record for recent presidents\u2014more change in the first 13 months than his four immediate predecessors saw in their first two years.[672] Notable early departures included National Security Advisor Mike Flynn (after just 25 days in office), Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, replaced by retired Marine General John F. Kelly on July 28, 2017,[673] and Press Secretary Sean Spicer.[672] Close personal aides to Trump such as Steve Bannon, Hope Hicks, John McEntee and Keith Schiller, have quit or been forced out.[674]\n\nTrump has been slow to appoint second-tier officials in the executive branch, saying that many of the positions are unnecessary. As of October 2017 , there were hundreds of sub-cabinet positions vacant.[675] At the end of his first year in office, CBS News reported that \"of the roughly 600 key executive branch positions, just 241 have been filled, 135 nominated candidates await confirmation while 244 slots have no nominee at all.\"[676][needs update]\n\nCabinet\n\nCabinet meeting, March 2017\n\nTrump's cabinet nominations included U.S. Senator from Alabama Jeff Sessions as Attorney General,[677] financier Steve Mnuchin as Secretary of the Treasury,[678] retired Marine Corps General James Mattis as Secretary of Defense,[679] and ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State.[680] Trump also brought on board politicians who had opposed him during the presidential campaign, such as neurosurgeon Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development,[681] and South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley as Ambassador to the United Nations.[682]\n\nWhile most of Trump's nominees were approved by the GOP majority in the Senate, the confirmation of education reform activist Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education[683] required Vice President Pence to cast a rare tie-breaking vote, the first in a Cabinet nominee's Senate confirmation.[684]\n\nTwo of Trump's 15 original cabinet members were gone within 15 months: Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price was forced to resign in September 2017 due to excessive use of private charter jets and military aircraft, and Trump replaced Secretary of State Rex Tillerson with Mike Pompeo in March 2018 over disagreements on foreign policy.[685][674] EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned in July 2018 amidst multiple investigations into his conduct.[686]\n\nInvestigations\n\nRussian interference\n\nIn January 2017, American intelligence agencies\u2014the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA, represented by the Director of National Intelligence\u2014jointly stated with \"high confidence\" that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election to favor the election of Trump.[687][688] In March 2017, FBI Director James Comey told Congress that \"the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian government's efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. That includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia's efforts.\"[689] Later, in testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee on June 8, he affirmed he has \"no doubt\" that Russia interfered in the 2016 election, adding \"they did it with purpose and sophistication\".[690]\n\nTrump's connections to Russia have been widely reported by the press.[691][692] One of Trump's campaign managers, Paul Manafort, had worked for several years to help pro-Russian politician Viktor Yanukovich win the Ukrainian presidency.[693] Other Trump associates, including former National Security Advisor Michael T. Flynn and political consultant Roger Stone, have been connected to Russian officials.[694][695] Russian agents were overheard during the campaign saying they could use Manafort and Flynn to influence Trump.[696] Members of Trump's campaign and later his White House staff, particularly Flynn, were in contact with Russian officials both before and after the November election.[697] On December 29, 2016, Flynn talked with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak about sanctions that had been imposed the same day; Trump later fired Flynn for falsely claiming he had not discussed the sanctions.[698]\n\nDismissal of James Comey\n\nOn May 9, 2017, Trump dismissed FBI Director James Comey. He attributed the action to recommendations from Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein,[699] which criticized Comey's conduct in the investigation about Hillary Clinton's emails.[700] On May 11, Trump stated that he was concerned with the ongoing \"Russia thing\"[701] and that he had intended to fire Comey earlier.[702]\n\nAccording to a Comey memo of a private conversation on February 14, 2017, Trump said he \"hoped\" Comey would drop the investigation into Michael Flynn.[703] In March and April, Trump had told Comey that the ongoing suspicions formed a \"cloud\" impairing his presidency,[704] and asked him to publicly state that he was not personally under investigation.[705] He also asked intelligence chiefs Dan Coats and Michael Rogers to issue statements saying there was no evidence that his campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 election.[706] Both refused, considering this an inappropriate request, although not illegal.[707] Comey eventually testified on June 8 that while he was director, the FBI investigations did not target Trump himself.[704][708] In a statement on Twitter Trump implied that he had \"tapes\" of conversations with Comey, before later stating that he did not in fact have such tapes.[709]\n\nSpecial counsel\n\nOn May 17, 2017, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller, a former Director of the FBI, to serve as special counsel for the United States Department of Justice (DOJ). In this capacity, Mueller oversees the investigation into \"any links and/or coordination between Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump, and any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation\".[710] Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.[711] Mueller is also investigating the Trump campaign's possible ties to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Qatar, Israel, and China.[712][713]\n\nThe Washington Post reported that days after Comey's dismissal the special counsel started investigating whether Trump had obstructed justice.[714] Trump's lawyer Jay Sekulow stated that he had not been notified of any such investigation.[715][716] ABC News later reported that the special counsel was gathering preliminary information about possible obstruction of justice but had not launched a full-scale investigation.[717]\n\nIn January 2018, The New York Times reported that Trump had ordered Mueller to be fired in June, after learning that Mueller was investigating possible obstruction of justice, but backed down after White House Counsel Don McGahn said he would quit;[718] Trump called the report \"fake news\".[719][720] The New York Times reported in April 2018 that Trump had again wanted the investigation shut down in early December 2017, but stopped after learning the news reports he based his decision on were incorrect.[721] In April 2018, following an FBI raid on the office and home of Trump's private attorney Michael Cohen, Trump mused aloud about firing Mueller.[722]\n\nIn January 2018, The Washington Post reported that Mueller wants to interview Trump about the removal of Michael Flynn and James Comey.[723] Trump has expressed a willingness to do the interview; according to The New York Times, some of his lawyers have warned against doing so. Mueller can subpoena Trump to testify if Trump refuses.[724] As of March 2018 , Trump is reportedly a \"subject\" of the investigation, meaning his conduct is being looked at, but not a \"target\" which would indicate the likelihood of criminal charges.[725]\n\nIn August 2018, Trump wrote that Attorney General Jeff Sessions \"should stop\" the special counsel investigation \"right now\"; he also referred to it as a \"rigged witch hunt\".[726][727][728]\n\nImpeachment efforts\n\nCongressman Al Green delivers a speech calling for impeachment of President Trump, June 2017.\n\nFormal efforts to start the process of impeachment against Trump, who took office in January 2017, have been initiated by Representatives Al Green and Brad Sherman, both Democrats.[729][730] Other people and groups have asserted that Trump has engaged in impeachable activity during his presidency.[731][732] Talk of impeachment began before Trump took office.[733][734]\n\nSerious proposals to impeach Trump for obstruction of justice were made in May 2017, after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey[735][736][737] and allegations surfaced that Trump had asked Comey to drop the investigation against Michael Flynn.[738] A December 2017 resolution of impeachment failed in the House by a 58\u2013364 margin.[739] Since the Republicans control both the House and the Senate, the likelihood of impeachment during the 2017\u20132019 115th Congress is considered remote.[740][741]\n\nIndependently of impeachment, some commentators have speculated that Trump could be stripped of his powers and duties for incapacity under the 25th Amendment of the Constitution.[742][743][744]\n\n2020 presidential campaign\n\nTrump signaled his intention to run for a second term by filing with the FEC within hours of assuming the presidency.[745] This transformed his 2016 election committee into a 2020 reelection one.[746] Trump marked the official start of the campaign with a rally in Melbourne, Florida, on February 18, 2017, less than a month after taking office.[747] By January 2018, Trump's reelection committee had $22 million in hand[748] and it had raised a total amount exceeding $50 million towards the 2020 campaign as of July 2018 .[749]\n\nNotes\n\nReferences"}

{"label": false, "txt": "Cynthia Ann Crawford (born February 20, 1966) is an American model and actress. Her years of success at modeling made her an international celebrity that has led to roles in television and film, and work as a spokesperson.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nCynthia Ann Crawford was born in DeKalb, Illinois, on February 20, 1966,[2] the daughter of John Daniel Crawford and Jennifer Sue Crawford-Moluf (n\u00e9e Walker).[3][4] She has two sisters, Chris and Danielle,[5] as well as a brother, Jeffery, who died of childhood leukemia at age 3.[6] She has stated that her family has been in the United States for generations and that her ancestry is mostly German, English, and French.[7] By appearing in an episode of Who Do You Think You Are? in 2013, she discovered that her ancestors included English nobility and continental royal families of the Middle Ages and that she was descended from Charlemagne.[8]\n\nIn her sophomore year at high school, she received a call from a local clothing store regarding modelling work, only to discover that it was a practical joke set up by two of her classmates. However, the following year another store hired a number of high school girls, including Crawford, to work for them (including a fashion shoot). In her junior year, local photographer Roger Legel, whose duties included photographing a different college girl to be that week's coed in the DeKalb Nite Weekly, asked to take her picture for the publication; the result was Crawford's first cover.[9] The photo and positive feedback she received were enough to convince her to take up modeling. She entered the Elite Model Management's Look of the Year contest at 17 and was the runner-up. Elite Model Management in Chicago then started representing her.\n\nCrawford graduated from DeKalb High School in 1984 as valedictorian.[10] She earned an academic scholarship to study chemical engineering at Northwestern University, which she attended for only one semester. She dropped out in order to pursue a full-time modeling career. After working for photographer Victor Skrebneski in Chicago, Crawford moved to New York City in 1986 and signed with the Elite New York modeling agency.[11]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, Crawford was among the most popular supermodels and a ubiquitous presence on magazine covers, runways, and in fashion campaigns. She was repeatedly and frequently featured on the cover of many magazines, including Vogue, W, People, Harper's Bazaar, Elle, Cosmopolitan, and Allure. A partial count in 1998 totalled over 500 appearances.[12] Crawford has walked the runways for Chanel, Versace, Dolce & Gabbana, Christian Dior, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors, Todd Oldham, DKNY, and Valentino. Crawford also appeared in many fashion campaigns during her career, including those for Versace, Calvin Klein, Escada, David Yurman, Oscar De La Renta, Balmain, Hermes, Ellen Tracy, Valentino, Bally, Liz Claiborne, Herv\u00e9 Leger, Halston, Anne Klein, Isaac Mizrahi, Blumarine, Guess, Ink, Gap, and Revlon. She has also worked for Omega, Maybelline, Clairol, Pepsi, and Chilean retail stores Ripley (partner of Macy's).\n\nIn 1987, Crawford appeared during the opening credits of the Michael J. Fox film The Secret of My Success. Three years later, she appeared alongside top models Christy Turlington, Linda Evangelista, Tatjana Patitz and Naomi Campbell on the cover of the January 1990 edition of British Vogue magazine. Crawford and the other four models subsequently appeared in the video for George Michael's hit \"Freedom '90\" later that year. Subsequently, Crawford played the lost love of Jon Bon Jovi in the 1994 video for his version of \"Please Come Home For Christmas\", \"John Taylor\" in the 2011 video for Duran Duran's \"Girl Panic\" (featuring supermodels as the band, including Naomi Campbell as Simon Le Bon), and Headmistress in the 2015 video for Taylor Swift's \"Bad Blood\" as part of a cast including Jessica Alba (Domino), Selena Gomez (Arsyn), and fellow models Lily Aldridge, Cara Delevingne, Gigi Hadid, Martha Hunt and Karlie Kloss (as Frostbyte, Mother Chucker, Slay-Z, Homeslice and Knockout respectively).\n\nThe red Versace dress which she wore to the 63rd Academy Awards in 1991 had a major influence on fashion, and many copies and fakes of the dress were produced.[13][14][15] In 1992, Crawford\u2014through GoodTimes Home Video and her company Crawdaddy Productions\u2014made an exercise video with Radu Teodorescu named Cindy Crawford: Shape Your Body; although criticised by some[who?] for being unsafe,[citation needed] it was hugely successful and led to two equally lucrative followups, Cindy Crawford: The Next Challenge in 1993 (again with Radu) and Cindy Crawford: A New Dimension in 2000; the latter, made with fitness expert Kathy Kaehler and produced not long after Crawford gave birth to her first child, was aimed at new mothers getting back into shape. In 2001, Crawford also made a shorter fitness video aimed at children, Mini-Muscles with Cindy Crawford and the Fit-wits, an animated production featuring the voices of Crawford (who also appears at the beginning in live action), Radu and Kobe Bryant.\n\nThe inaugural issue of George, a short lived political magazine in the 1990s, featured Crawford dressed like George Washington on the cover. In 2005, the American Society of Magazine Editors listed it as the 22nd best magazine cover of the last 40 years.[16]\n\nCrawford is 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm) tall[1] with brown hair and eyes. Her measurements are 34\u201325.5\u201336\".[17] Crawford's trademark is a mole (or \"beauty mark\") above her upper lip. She is so closely associated with this physical feature that she appeared in an Australian advertising campaign for flavoured milk featuring a TV commercial wherein she \"licked off\" her own mole.[18] During the beginning of her career, the mole was removed from her modeling pictures, including her first Vogue cover.[citation needed] Her resemblance to model Gia Carangi led her to being known as \"Baby Gia\".[19][20]\n\nCrawford has also been on TV and in films. From 1989 to 1995, Crawford was host of MTV's House of Style. In the early 1990s, Crawford starred in the Pepsi and Pepsi Stuff advertising.[21][22] In 1992, she appeared in Pepsi's Super Bowl commercial,[23] aired during Super Bowl XXVI. In 2016, Pepsi released a remake of the commercial, also featuring Crawford.[23] In 1995, Crawford broke into movies as the female lead in the movie Fair Game. Her performance was panned by critics\u2014Leonard Maltin commented \"In her acting debut, supermodel Crawford makes a good jogger.\"[24] The film was also a financial failure, with expenses of $50 million and $11 million takings at the box office. In 2001, she costarred as part of an ensemble cast in The Simian Line. Again the film was not successful or critically acclaimed, but Crawford's acting was not criticized. She has had many lesser roles guest starring on TV and as supporting roles, often playing herself. For example, in 2000, she was one of the celebrities (along with Victoria Silvstedt, Anna Falchi and Megan Gale) playing themselves in the Italian comedy Body Guards - Guardie del corpo. In the 1990s, Carol Shaw, her make-up artist, named a lipstick color after Crawford as a part of the Lorac Cosmetics lip-wear line.[25]\n\nIn July 1988, she posed nude for Playboy magazine in a shoot by photographer Herb Ritts.[26] In October 1998, Crawford returned to the pages of Playboy for a second nude pictorial, again taken by Ritts.[27]\n\nCrawford has consistently ranked highly on lists of the world's sexiest people. She was ranked number 5 on Playboy's list of the 100 sexiest stars of the 20th century. A 1997 Shape magazine survey of 4,000 picked her as the second (after Demi Moore) most beautiful woman in the world. In 2002, Crawford was named one of the 50 most beautiful people by People magazine. In her forties, she claimed No. 26 in the 2006 Hot 100 issue of Maxim magazine.[28] She was named No. 3 on VH1's 40 Hottest Hotties of the 90s and was named one of the \"100 Hottest Women of All-Time\" by Men's Health.[29]\n\nFashion designer Michael Kors summed up her impact:\n\n\u201c Cindy changed the perception of the \"sexy American girl\" from classic blue eyed blonde to a more sultry brunette with brains, charm, and professionalism to spare.[30] \u201d\n\nAfter modeling [ edit ]\n\nCrawford in October 2009\n\nCrawford quit full-time modeling in 2000 and now appears only occasionally in fashion magazines. She continues to provide celebrity endorsement for a variety of projects. In 2005, Crawford created a line of beauty products with Jean-Louis Sebagh called Meaningful Beauty for Guthy-Renker.[31] Crawford has stated that she regularly receives certain cosmetic procedures, including Botox and vitamin injections. She first saw a plastic surgeon at the age of 28.[32]\n\nIn 2005, Crawford launched a new line of furniture under the \"Cindy Crawford Home Collection\" name. The collection is manufactured by HM Richards Inc. She assisted in the creation of the line by consulting on the features, colors, or styles that fit the needs of families or reflected her own tastes.[33] She also has a furniture line with Raymour & Flanigan and launched a home goods line with J. C. Penney in late 2009.[34]\n\nIn 2009, Crawford was one of many celebrities to be photographed by Deborah Anderson for the coffee table book Room 23, produced by philanthropist Diana Jenkins. In addition to appearing in the book, Crawford was the cover model and wrote the dedication.[35]\n\nCrawford returned to modeling in May 2011, appearing on the cover of the May 2011 issue of Vogue Mexico.[36]\n\nBecoming, a book about Crawford's life and career co-written by Crawford and Katherine O'Leary, was published in September 2015.[37]\n\nCrawford and her daughter Kaia appeared together on the cover of the April 2016 issue of Vogue Paris.[38] In 2016, she became a spokesperson for Acqua Minerale San Benedetto in Italy.[39]\n\nIn September 2017, Crawford, along with models Claudia Schiffer, Naomi Campbell, Helena Christensen and Carla Bruni, closed the Versace spring/summer 2018 fashion show, which was an homage to the late Gianni Versace.[40]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nCrawford was married to actor Richard Gere from 1991 to 1995.

I just gained weight & that's it. Why is it so much harder to lose after baby though!!\u2026 ughhhh my hips & butt are huge now! They were big to begin with!\"\n\nAw!

Gay Pride Parade in West Hollywood.\n\nPHOTOS: Demi Lovato through the years\n\nLovato, on her end, expressed to Cosmo on Campus back in February 2013 that she was looking for a romance. \"I'm in a place where I can finally trust and love and be a better person for the man I am in a relationship with, instead of being a clingy girlfriend or getting jealous,\" she said. \"It is very unhealthy when girls devote all of their time to a guy and forget their friends and family.

MTV's official handle promptly retweeted the news on Wednesday, Aug. 20. The singer's smash hit, \"Wrecking Ball,\" is up for Video of the Year.\n\nPHOTOS: What the stars wore to the 2013 VMAs\n\nUnlike last year, Cyrus, 21, will not be performing at the star-studded awards show. Fans, critics, and stars alike were shocked, to say the least, after the singer gyrated onstage with a giant foam finger and twerked up on Robin Thicke during their memorable medley duet last August.\n\nPHOTOS: The wildest VMAs moments ever\n\nAs previously reported by Us Weekly in January, Thicke was upset with Cyrus for \"going too far\" during the show. \"He thinks she hijacked the performance,\" an insider told Us.\n\nThe Bangerz singer, from her end, resented Thicke for not defending her after the show. \"Miley thinks Robin threw her under the bus,\" another source told Us.\n\nPHOTOS: Miley's wild life\n\nThis year's performers will include Beyonce (who is nominated in eight categories), Taylor Swift (who released her new single, \"Shake It Off,\" this past week), Iggy Azalea, and more.

Michelle Dockery's Stylist Spills Her Style Rules\n\nWith the 2014 Emmys just days away, celeb stylist Micaela Erlanger (who helped catapult Lupita Nyong'o to the top of the year's best dressed lists) tells Us Weekly just how she's preparing for the red carpet on Aug. 25.\n\nPHOTOS: Lupita's best red carpet moments so far\n\n\"The Emmys red carpet is one where you can have a lot of fun and take some risks when it comes to gowns and outfit choices,\" Erlanger, who will be dressing her longtime client and Emmy nominee Michelle Dockery, tells Us.\n\nPHOTOS: Michelle and more stars at the 2013 Emmys\n\nThe celeb stylist, who partnered with Dove for the Emmys, says red carpet prep begins in the shower. \"Exfoliate, and moisturize, moisturize, moisturize!\" she says. \"I have a real appreciation for products that yield gorgeous results, and I personally love to use new Dove Body Wash. I get softer smoother skin after one shower!\"\n\nPHOTOS: Emmys best dressed stars of all time\n\nErlanger may spill the beans on the products she suggests for radiant skin, but she's tight-lipped on the exact look for the Downton Abbey leading lady nominee. Whichever gown she chooses, Dockery will be following Erlanger's three red carpet rules: \"Stand up straight, smile with confidence and wear heels you can walk in.\"\n\nThat last rule doesn't stop at her clients' feet either. \"I always lean towards a comfortable red carpet dress, because no one wants to be worrying about wardrobe malfunctions,\" she tells Us. \"They should be enjoying the evening and have a wonderful time feeling confident in what they have on.\"\n\nKate Upton Crashes List of Top 10 Highest-Paid Models for First Time\n\nWhen Kate Upton signed with her modeling agency, people thought the agent was \"crazy.\"\n\n\"She wasn't 'fashion' enough,\" the famed Ivan Bart told the New York Times in February 2012.\n\nThe 22-year-old blond bombshell is cashing in on that commercial quality now. For the first time, Upton has landed on Forbes magazine's ranking of the highest-paid models. Believe it or not, it's the first time Upton crashed the top 10.\n\nSee Photos of the World's Highest-Paid Models of 2014\n\nUpton tied for third place and took home a paycheck of $7 million before taxes between June 2013 and June 2014, thanks to clients such as Express clothing line and Bobbi Brown cosmetics. Upton also had a role alongside Cameron Diaz in the movie The Other Woman. One of the people who casts the famed Victoria's Secret fashion shows, Sophia Neophitou, told The Times in that same article that the company \"would never use\" Upton. Think she'd care to take back that statement now?\n\nStill, Upton and the other women in the top five have room for improvement. None of them came close to bringing in the whopping $49 million salary earned by Gisele Bundchen. Mrs. Tom Brady's work with Chanel, Carolina Herrera, and H&M, as well as deals with beauty brands in her native Brazil and her own lines of lingerie and jelly sandals there, helped her bring in enough money to land at the top of the list for the eighth consecutive year. (In case you were wondering, the 34-year-old Gisele even out-earned her NFL star husband by $16 million!)\n\n[Related: See Kate Upton's Teen Modeling Pics]\n\nTwo women who were hired by Victoria's Secret, Doutzen Kroes, 29, and Adriana Lima, 33, tied for the second spot on the list with an income of $8 million each. Kroes \u2014 who didn't make the cut last year but ranked fifth in 2012 \u2014 has contracts with L'Or\u00e9al, Emilio Pucci, and H&M. Meanwhile, Lima (last year's No. 3) also worked with Maybelline and clothiers Desigual.\n\nFamed British beauty Kate Moss (No. 4 in 2013) earned an estimated $7 million in the past year, enough to tie with Upton in 2014. Moss's many campaigns, such as the one for Rimmel cosmetics and jeweler David Yurman, and the 40-year-old's contributions to a clothing line for Topshop, added up big.\n\nFind out where Miranda Kerr, Karlie Kloss, Cara Delevingne, and more ranked on the list at Forbes.com.\n\nFollow Raechal Leone Shewfelt on Twitter\n\nElizabeth Vargas Leaves Vacation to Enter Rehab for Alcohol Addiction\n\nElizabeth Vargas has suffered a setback in her struggle with sobriety.\n\nThe 51-year-old newswoman left a vacation in California over the weekend to return to rehab to treat her alcoholism.\n\n\"As so many other recovering alcoholics know, overcoming the disease can be a long and incredibly difficult process,\" the 20/20 co-anchor said in a statement released by ABC. \"I feel I have let myself, my co-workers and most importantly my family down and for that I am ashamed and sorry. I am committed to battling and addressing this debilitating disease and want to thank everyone who has offered their unwavering support during this trying time.\"\n\nABC is standing behind Vargas, saying in a statement, \"Nothing is more important than Elizabeth's health and well-being and we stand squarely behind her. Our thoughts are with Elizabeth and her family and we look forward to having her back at ABC News when she feels ready to return.\"\n\nVargas first entered rehab last November at the urging of her husband, singer/songwriter Marc Cohn, with whom she has two young sons. While she is an alcoholic, she sought treatment in a facility specializing in trauma because she suffered from anxiety and panic attacks since childhood and later started drinking to ease it. Her first attempt at rehab wasn't without its difficulties. After staying for 28 days, she left against doctors' advice and returned home. Five days later she returned and stayed until doctors gave her a green light.\n\nIn January, she appeared on Good Morning America and opened up about her struggle, saying, \"I am an alcoholic. It took me a long time to admit that to myself. It took me a long time to admit it to my family, but I am.\" She confessed that hiding her problem through the years has become \"exhausting\" and she felt like a \"failure\" when she would cover stories on alcoholism when she was privately struggling with it herself.\n\nVargas's last tweet before entering rehab this time was about the late Robin Williams, who was also a recovering alcoholic and cocaine addict and suffered from depression.\n\nI am so sad for robin \u2013 and his fight with addiction. My heart goes out to his wife and kids. \u2014 Elizabeth Vargas (@EVargasABC) August 12, 2014\n\nSomeone tweeted back to her, \"Glad ur still with us, Elizabeth. Never give up the fight!\" to which she replied:\n\n@VincentSaia1 thanks! It really is one day at a time \u2014 Elizabeth Vargas (@EVargasABC) August 12, 2014\n\nChristina Aguilera Welcomes a Baby Girl\n\nChristina Aguilera has a \"Beautiful\" new addition.\n\nThe 33-year-old singer and her fiance, Matthew Rutler, welcomed their first child together \u2014 a girl! \u2014 on Saturday, The Insider With Yahoo confirmed.\n\n\"So proud to welcome our beautiful daughter Summer Rain Rutler into the world,\" Aguilera tweeted early Monday morning.\n\n[Related: Peek Inside Christina Aguilera's Baby Shower]\n\n\n\nThis is the second child for Aguilera, who is also mom to 6-year-old Max from her first marriage.\n\nAguilera sat out the last two seasons of The Voice as she prepped for her new addition.\n\nThe \"Your Body\" crooner wasn't shy about showing off her growing belly either.

{"label": false, "txt": "Super Bowl XXXVIII \u2013 which was broadcast live on February 1, 2004 from Houston, Texas on the CBS television network in the United States \u2013 was noted for a controversial halftime show in which Janet Jackson's breast, adorned with a nipple shield, was exposed by Justin Timberlake for about half a second, in what was later referred to as a \"wardrobe malfunction\".[1] The incident, sometimes referred to as Nipplegate,[2][3] was widely discussed. Along with the rest of the halftime show, it led to an immediate crackdown and widespread debate on perceived indecency in broadcasting.[1] The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fined CBS a record US$550,000 which was fought in the Supreme Court,[4] but that fine was appealed and ultimately voided by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2011 ruling, and a case to reinstate the fine was refused in 2012.[5][6]\n\nThe incident was ridiculed both within the United States and abroad, with a number of commentators considering the incident a planned publicity stunt,[7] and American commentators in particular viewing it as a sign of decreasing morality in American culture, while others considered the incident harmless and argued that it received an undue amount of attention and backlash.[8][9][10][11][12] The increased regulation of broadcasting raised concerns regarding censorship and free speech in the United States,[13] and the FCC increased the fine per indecency violation from US$27,500 to US$325,000 shortly after the event.[14] The halftime show that year was produced by MTV and was themed around the network's Choose or Lose campaign due to the event occurring during a presidential election year. Following the wardrobe incident, the National Football League (NFL) announced that MTV, which also produced the halftime show for Super Bowl XXXV, would not be involved in any halftime shows in the future.[15] The MTV Chief Executive stated in an interview with Reuters that Jackson engineered the stunt, while Timberlake was informed of it just moments before he took the stage.[16][17] The exposure was broadcast to a total audience of 143.6 million viewers.[18]\n\nYouTube co-founder Jawed Karim claims that this incident was what led to the creation of the video sharing website.[19][20] The incident also made \"Janet Jackson\" the most searched term, event and image in internet history, as well as the most searched person and term of 2004 and 2005.[21][22][23][24] The incident also broke the record for \"most searched event over one day\".[25] Jackson was later listed in the 2007 edition of Guinness World Records as \"Most Searched in Internet History\" and the \"Most Searched for News Item\".[26] It became the most watched, recorded and replayed television moment in TiVo history and \"enticed an estimated 35,000 new [TiVo] subscribers to sign up\".[27][28][29] The incident also coined the phrase \"wardrobe malfunction\", which was later added to the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary.[30]\n\nFollowing the incident, CBS parent company Viacom, and their co-owned subsidiaries MTV and Infinity Broadcasting, enforced a blacklist of Jackson's singles and music videos on many radio formats and music channels worldwide.[31] As of 2018, neither Jackson nor Timberlake are banned from the halftime show.[32] Timberlake later performed at Super Bowl LII on February 4, 2018.\n\nBackground and development [ edit ]\n\nIn 2002, Entertainment Weekly reported that Jackson was the original choice to perform at the halftime show for Super Bowl XXXVI, however the NFL ultimately decided to select U2 to headline it after a group of NFL owners and officials attended the band's concert in New York City shortly after the September 11 attacks.[33] In September 2003, the NFL announced that Jackson would be the headline performer of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show.[34] Because the event was occurring during an election year, MTV decided that the show's theme would heavily focus on the network's \"Choose or Lose\" campaign, which encouraged younger viewers to be politically active and register to vote.[35]\n\nPrior to the incident, Timberlake had attended Jackson's Rhythm Nation Tour as an adolescent, and Jackson's energetic dance routines and daring performing style made a deep impression on him.[36] While Timberlake was a member of pop group 'N Sync, Jackson selected the boy band as the opening act for many dates of her blockbuster Velvet Rope World Tour, which helped promote and introduce the then-relatively unknown group and Timberlake to the public worldwide.[37] Timberlake said he was \"psyched\" and later described the experience as \"fulfilling\".[38][39] While on the tour, Jackson further promoted the group by performing with 'N Sync on several dates, including joining the group for a live a cappella duet of Stevie Wonder's \"Overjoyed\", which a biography stated was a \"highlight\" moment for Timberlake which \"gave Justin a chance to show his family and friends how far he had come\".[40] Following the tour, Timberlake and Jackson became \"good friends\", with Jackson also praising Timberlake.[41] Timberlake recreated Jackson's \"That's the Way Love Goes\" video with 'N Sync and was inspired by Jackson's performing style.[42]\n\nTimberlake had frequently mentioned admiring Jackson in many interviews during this time and throughout the following few years preceding the incident.[38][39][43] When asked who he thought was \"the sexiest woman on the planet\", Timberlake had said \"I've thought Janet Jackson has nothing but sex appeal, so I'd probably say her.\"[44]\n\nTimberlake later asked Jackson to sing backing vocals on \"(And She Said) Take Me Now\", a song from his debut solo album Justified which was initially planned to be released as a single, commenting \"I wrote the chorus from a girl's perspective, and I just thought we should get a female on the part. Her name was the first that popped up in my head just because I love her voice. It sounds like feathers. I mean, she sounds like an angel.\"[45]\n\nIncident [ edit ]\n\nDuring the halftime show, Jackson performed a medley of hits, beginning with \"All for You\", \"Rhythm Nation\" and a brief excerpt of \"The Knowledge\" before surprise guest Timberlake appeared to perform a duet version of his song \"Rock Your Body\".[46][47] The performance featured several suggestive dance moves by both singers, and as Timberlake reached his final line of \"Rock Your Body\", \"I'm gonna have you naked by the end of this song\", Timberlake pulled off a part of Jackson's costume, revealing her right breast, partially covered by a piece of nipple jewelry, for less than a second. In the immediate aftermath of the incident, the CBS broadcast cut to an aerial view of Reliant Stadium (now known as NRG Stadium), the host venue for Super Bowl XXXVIII, but was unable to do so before the picture was sent to the television sets of an estimated 143 million viewers. The incident has been referred to as \"Nipplegate\" and \"the boob seen 'round the world\" in the media.[48]\n\nThe incident led to a five-second broadcast delay being implemented for all future performances on live television to ensure that any potentially indecent material is not broadcast in full, and a protracted legal battle over FCC censorship which lasted until 2012 and nearly went to the Supreme Court.[49] Jackson's publicist stated the performance ending was only supposed to reveal Jackson's red lace bra, though the lace undergarment was accidentally removed along with the outer layer.[8][50]\n\nOn June 29, 2012, the Supreme Court declined an FCC appeal. The FCC was attempting to reinstate the government's fine of US$550,000 which was overturned by the lower court based on FCC rules that were in place at the time of the broadcast, which were later changed. Chief Justice John Roberts said \"It is now clear that the brevity of an indecent broadcast \u2013 be it word or image \u2013 cannot immunize it from FCC censure...Any future 'wardrobe malfunctions' will not be protected on the ground relied on by the court below.\"[6]\n\nResponses [ edit ]\n\n\"It's truly embarrassing for me to know that 90 million [140 million] people saw my breast, and then to see it blown up on the Internet the size of a computer screen ...\" \"But there are much worse things in the world, and for this to be such a focus, I don't understand\". \u2013 Jackson on Super Bowl incident.[51]\n\nMTV stated, \"The tearing of Janet Jackson's costume was unrehearsed, unplanned, completely unintentional and was inconsistent with assurances we had about the content of the performance. MTV regrets this incident occurred and we apologize to anyone who was offended by it.\"[52] The network also said, \"Our goal with the Super Bowl Halftime show was to produce an entertaining stage experience with a positive message about empowerment and voting. We are disappointed that this message has been overshadowed by the unfortunate incident\".[53] A statement from CBS read, \"We attended all rehearsals throughout the week and there was no indication that any such thing would happen. The moment did not conform to CBS broadcast standards and we would like to apologize to anyone who was offended.\"[52] Viacom President Mel Karmazin said that while the company can be proud of 99% of what people saw on the broadcast, it understands \"what a difference one percent can make\". NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the show produced by MTV, which like CBS, was owned by Viacom at the time (before the two networks were respectively separated into Viacom and CBS Corporation, both controlled by National Amusements, in December 2005), fell far short of the \"tasteful, first-class entertainment\" the league expected. FCC Chairman Michael Powell, appearing before a Senate panel, called the Super Bowl incident \"a new low for prime time television\".[54][55] Joe Browne, Executive Vice President of the NFL, said, \"We were extremely disappointed by elements of the MTV-produced Halftime show. They were totally inconsistent with assurances our office was given about the show. It's unlikely that MTV will produce another Super Bowl halftime.\"[52] An hour-long MTV documentary titled \"Making the Super Bowl Halftime Show\" was scheduled to premiere the following week but was canceled before it ever aired and has never been broadcast subsequently.[56][57]\n\nSalli Frattini, the executive producer for MTV who had planned the entire performance, recalled a phone call from the officiating booth that was her first indication something had gone wrong. Frattini was in a truck outside of Reliant Stadium celebrating the end of the 12-minute halftime performance, which they initially thought was a success. \"We were like, 'Uh, we\u2019re playing that back right now'\", Frattini said. \"There was lots of chaos in the truck, and we played it back and we were like, 'Oh, s[hit]. What just happened?'\" Alex Coletti, another MTV producer, said he could not find Jackson after the performance. \"I tried to get in touch to make sure she was okay\", he said. \"Her entire camp stopped answering the phones. I finally got to her tour manager, and they were already at the airport.\" Coletti assumed the singer was so mortified that she fled immediately, though later assumed the incident was a possible \"set up\", adding it was the last time he had spoken to her. Coletti's assumption is potentially another reason for Jackson's blacklisting on MTV in addition to other music channels and radio formats.[58] An MTV representative confirmed the costume tear was conceptualized by the MTV staff, in which the show's producers mockingly ripped their clothing in response to Timberlake's closing lyric during rehearsals. This led to Jackson and Timberlake improvising the move, in which Timberlake tore off Jackson's kilt. Frattini stated, \"When we did the original rehearsal, there was conversation about a fake skirt she would wear, and that Justin would actually pull open the skirt and take off the skirt. In rehearsal, they actually tried to rip open the skirt, which kind of went with the lyrics of the song\".[8] The production team then discussed another option, which led to the costume tearing, although the outfit was intended to stay in place.[8]\n\nJackson's representative explained the incident, saying, \"Justin was supposed to pull away the rubber bustier to reveal a red lace bra. The garment collapsed and her breast was accidentally revealed.\"[59] CBS forced Jackson to release a video apology, and said \"My decision to change the Super Bowl performance was made after the final rehearsal. MTV, CBS, [and] the NFL had no knowledge of this whatsoever and unfortunately, the whole thing went wrong in the end. I am really sorry if I offended anyone, that was truly not my intention\". Jackson later commented, \"Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident\" when the statement was replayed in the media.[60] A written statement read, \"The decision to have a costume reveal at the end of my halftime show performance was made after final rehearsals. MTV was completely unaware of it. It was not my intention that it go as far as it did. I apologize to anyone offended \u2013 including the audience, MTV, CBS and the NFL.\"[53] Due to the event being accidental and unintentional, Jackson refused to release another apology statement to media outlets following this. Speaking to USA Today, Jackson said, \"It's truly embarrassing for me to know that 90 million [140 million] people saw my breast, and then to see it blown up on the Internet the size of a computer screen ... but there are much worse things in the world, and for this to be such a focus, I don't understand.\"[51] Regarding continued backlash, she responded, \"Who knows...Maybe they'll get mad at something that I do in my show, but at least it won't be new to me, since I've already gone through all of this. But I feel very positive that things are going to work out just fine. Everything happens for a reason.\"[51]\n\nPublicist Marvet Britto stated, \"Jackson embodies grace, style and integrity...She has never been known as a bad person.\" Britto describes Jackson\u2019s videotaped apology as \"impersonal\", saying, \"She has never been an impersonal artist, so it made it seem like she was guilty of something, and she wasn't. I would have had her and Timberlake apologizing side by side right from the beginning, since they performed side by side. Otherwise, it made the whole apology seem calculated and contrived.\" Jackson said of the apology, \"I probably should have done it live. But there was so much going on at the time that I needed to just get it done. It is what it is. And it will pass, and I'm fine with it.\"[61] At one point Jackson was scheduled to be interviewed about the incident by Diane Sawyer on the ABC newsmagazine Primetime, however, the interview never came to fruition.[62] Jackson later briefly discussed the incident on Good Morning America and the Late Show with David Letterman. Jackson's outfit was designed by famed designer Alexander McQueen, with Jackson later commenting \"I don't blame him; he didn't rip it. Alexander is so great at what he does \u2013 he's a genius.\"[63] In an interview with Australia's Herald Sun, Jackson commented on Timberlake (whom, as mentioned, Jackson had previously known personally and aided when she selected his former group 'N Sync to open for her Velvet Rope World Tour at the start of their career[36][38]) distancing himself from the incident and seemingly changing with fame. \"I really want to be honest about this, but I just feel that anything I say about him will be taken the wrong way\", said Jackson. \"I do think that Justin is very talented and that he has a very big career ahead of him. But he seems to have changed recently. He's gotten a bit cocky. You know, some people can handle success and some people can't. I'm starting to wonder if (the latter) is the case with Justin. And it hurts me to say that.\"[64] Producer Jimmy Jam revealed Jackson considered writing a song about the incident for her Damita Jo album, saying, \"I don't know whether it will or not. But I have a feeling it probably will, because kind of whatever's happening in her life tends to be what she writes about [...] It'd be kind of interesting to see what her feeling is about it.\"[65]\n\nfamine, homelessness, \"[The furor] is hypocritical, with everything you see on TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war AIDS . [...] They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. [...] People are going to think what they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast.\" \u2013 Jackson questioning media's focus on the event.[51]\n\nMichael Musto of The Village Voice commented on the media's reaction to the incident, saying, \"Janet became a symbolic Joan of Arc to burn at the stake. I actually do think her breast was used as a diversionary tactic \u2013 I'm not sure to distract from Iraq specifically \u2013 but it did distract from important issues, from things we actually should be appalled by. The story got an undue amount of attention when the fact is, nobody has proved how her breast harmed anyone.\"[66] Speaking to Robert Tannenbaum of Blender Magazine, Jackson had strong, if guarded, views on the reactions, saying the furor \"is hypocritical, with everything you see on TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war, famine, homelessness, AIDS\". The fact that it happened in an election year \"did have a great deal to do with it. They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. People are going to think what they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to have all those people see my breast. That's like having your penis hanging out in front of millions and millions of people.\"[31] Janet declared the reaction to the accidental exposure as \"contradictory\", noting it to occur in an era where commercials for beer and Viagra are both \"very sexual\" and \"practically omnipresent\".[66] Jackson also said the mishap was \"not intentional\" and a \"costume accident\", also commenting on some media outlets editing her taped apology, saying, \"Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident...That's what the media does, that's the way they are because they want it to be told a different way.\"[60] In Glamour Magazine, Janet exclaimed, \"It's hard to believe that there's a war and famine going on in the world and yet people made such a big deal about a breast. People said that it was done intentionally to sell records. Do you know what? I have never pulled a stunt. Why would you do that and have your album come out two months later? It doesn't make sense.\" In the ensuing months, Janet felt overwhelmed by the hostility towards her. \"People think I'm immune to being hurt by what's said. They ask me questions that shock me. Not everybody is as strong as the next person and words can kill. People push you and you start to think, 'Can I handle this?' But I know I can.\"[67]\n\nImmediately following the incident, Timberlake sounded unapologetic for his actions, telling Access Hollywood, \"Hey man, we love giving you all something to talk about.\"[50] Timberlake released a statement saying \"I am sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl. It was not intentional and is regrettable.\"[52] However, Timberlake was not required to film a video apology as Jackson was. Timberlake also addressed the incident at the Grammy Awards the following week, which Jackson was banned from attending after being scheduled as a presenter, saying \"I know it's been a rough week on everybody. What occurred was unintentional, completely regrettable and I apologize if you guys are offended.\"[68] Timberlake gave an additional interview at the Grammy event and stated, \"All I could say was, 'Oh, my God. Oh, my God,'\" Timberlake said. \"I looked at her. They brought a towel up on stage. They covered her up. I was completely embarrassed and just walked off the stage as quickly as I could. I'm frustrated at the whole situation. I'm frustrated that my character is being questioned. And the fact of the matter is, you know, I've had a good year, a really good year, especially with my music.\"[69] Timberlake later declared, \"It was something that went wrong. Then I felt like, I'm going to show everyone that this was something that didn't affect me, and I'm going to show up at the Grammys.\"[70] He later said he was unable to attend most of the halftime rehearsals due to being on tour in Spain, having only one day to rehearse.[71] While promoting his sophomore album FutureSex/LoveSounds over two years later, Timberlake expressed regret for his behavior, saying, \"In my honest opinion now ... I could've handled it better. ... I'm part of a community that consider themselves artists. And if there was something I could have done in her defense that was more than I realized then, I would have. But the other half of me was like, 'Wow. We still haven't found the weapons of mass destruction and everybody cares about this!'\" He added, \"I probably got 10 percent of the blame, and that says something about society ... I think that America's harsher on women. And I think that America is, you know, unfairly harsh on ethnic people.\"[72]\n\nMedia diversion [ edit ]\n\nJackson suspected ulterior motives in the media's reaction, expressing, \"It was just perfect timing to take people's focus off of other things. That's what happens, and it happened to me.\"[51] Accounts from several university leaders and management groups offered a similar premise. Michael Rich, director of Harvard's Center on Media and Child Health, exclaimed, \"Here we have Michael Powell upset about the happening in the Super Bowl, but the same Powell has been unwilling to do anything about the violence on television, where there has been much more research showing it has a harmful impact on kids.\" Robert Thompson, founding director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University, said, \"Michael Powell is representing the Super Bowl like everybody in the family sits around knitting booties, or like, it's the Macy's Day Parade. [...] Come on. There's gambling, there's a lot of drinking, partying, a carnival atmosphere\", he asserted. Jay Rosenthal, attorney for the Recording Artists' Coalition, says the FCC's involvement was a smoke-screen, or a \"sound bite attempt\" by the Republican-led commission to act as if it's doing something. \"When it comes to media consolidation issues affecting consumers and artists, they don't care about that. But when it comes to indecency, after ignoring it for years, all of a sudden they're snapping to attention\", he said. Simon Renshaw of management group The Firm stated it to be \"inappropriate\" that Powell is trying to distract people from the real issues of what's currently going on in the media. \"What I find offensive is CBS' refusal to carry MoveOn.org's ad during the Super Bowl\", which pictured children working in factories to pay off the Bush administration's budget deficit.[73] The Boston Legal episode \"Let Sales Ring\" likened the incident to being used as a distraction, portraying a news corporation which used the mishap to attract attention over other important events in the media.[74] Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone explained, \"For the FCC, Nipplegate provided an opportunity to restore order and flex whatever power they had left. Faced with lax broadcast standards for cable TV and satellite radio, as well as the absolute lawlessness of the Internet, the FCC becomes hell-bent on preserving common decency in the family-friendly realm of network television. Thus, screws are tightened everywhere under the body's jurisdiction: Tape delays are lengthened and more frequent and sexually suggestive performances are replaced by less provocative selections. While the aftermath of Nipplegate starts to fade, the FCC will continue to carry its torch for the next half-decade.\"[75] Cynthia Fuchs of Popmatters stated, \"It behooves TV producers and consumers to focus their attentions on significant \"news\", rather than the daily distractions offered up by politicians, performers, professional spinners, and journalists. Janet is not that person you watch on TV. And neither is anyone else.\"[76]\n\nPowell's response [ edit ]\n\nA decade after the incident, former FCC chairman Michael Powell gave his first interview regarding Jackson's performance, saying Jackson was treated unfairly and the controversy, including his own reaction, was completely overblown. Powell stated, \"I think we've been removed from this long enough for me to tell you that I had to put my best version of outrage on that I could put on. Part of it was surreal, right? Look, I think it was dumb to happen, and they knew the rules and were flirting with them, and my job is to enforce the rules, but, you know, really? This is what we're gonna do?\" Powell also said the treatment of Jackson, who was lambasted for causing \"an outrageous stunt\", was unfair, and commented on Timberlake not receiving the same backlash. \"I personally thought that was really unfair\", he said. \"It all turned into being about her. In reality, if you slow the thing down, it\u2019s Justin ripping off her breastplate.\"[58]\n\nPublic reaction [ edit ]\n\nUnited States [ edit ]\n\nIn the United States, the exposure of Jackson's breast by Timberlake led to much media attention and headlines, in which it was sometimes referred to as \"Nipplegate\".[2][3] The socially conservative media watchdog group Parents Television Council (PTC) issued a statement that same day condemning the halftime show, announcing that their members would file indecency complaints with the FCC and the council supported the Commission's decision to investigate the halftime show immediately.[77] In addition, the FCC received nearly 540,000 complaints from Americans,[15] with the PTC claiming responsibility for around 65,000 of them.[78] In its appeal to the Third Circuit Court, CBS disputed how many of the complaints were filed by individual, non-organized viewers.[79] Columnists L. Brent Bozell III[9] (who also founded the Parents Television Council) and Phyllis Schlafly[12] also expressed criticism of the halftime show in their weekly columns. Democratic senator Zell Miller of Georgia, both on the floor of the United States Senate[11] and in an editorial on Salon.com,[10] denounced the halftime show as what he perceived as declining morality in America. The day immediately following the Super Bowl, then-FCC chairman Michael Powell ordered an investigation into the halftime show.[1] Timberlake told CBS owned-and-operated station KCBS-TV in Los Angeles a few days following the Super Bowl that even his own family was offended by the mishap at the end of the halftime show.[80] However, an Associated Press poll taken nearly three weeks after the Super Bowl found that although 54% of American adults considered the exposure distasteful, only 18% supported the FCC's investigation.[81] Film director Spike Lee, speaking at Kent State University at Stark on February 3, called the incident a \"new low\" in entertainment.[2]\n\nThe Super Bowl controversy was also a subject of humor on all of the late-night talk shows. For example, CBS's own Late Show with David Letterman mocked the incident all week following the Super Bowl. Host David Letterman jokingly commented on the controversy the day after the Super Bowl that he \"was happy to see this thing happen ... because that meant for one night I wasn't the biggest boob on CBS\".[82] The next day, he also joked that President George W. Bush formed a \"Department of Wardrobe Security\" to prevent further wardrobe malfunctions.[83] On February 4, Letterman opened his monologue by joking about having a wardrobe malfunction.[84] Additionally, the Top Ten Lists featured on the program on that same night[85] briefly referenced the incident. Jackson's appearance on the Late Show the following month increased the show's ratings 20% from the program's usual weeknight opener.[86] Larry King also stated Jackson jokingly gave him a pair of suspenders with open holes around the nipples, commenting \"I wore them once, they were cute.\"[87] Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean called the FCC's investigation \"silly\", commenting \"In general, I think the FCC does have a role in promoting some reasonable standard of decency. However, considering what's on television these days, I think the FCC is being pretty silly about investigating this.\" Dean added \"I don't find it terribly shocking relative to some of the things you can find on standard cable television. I think the FCC probably has a lot of other things they should be pursuing.\"[88]\n\nSouth Park (aired on Comedy Central, a sister network to CBS at the time, and to MTV through Viacom) took aim at the hysteria in its eighth season premiere, \"Good Times with Weapons\", on March 17 of that year when Eric Cartman sneaks across a stage in the nude and later blames the incident on a \"wardrobe malfunction\". The townspeople are angered by Cartman's display, rather than feeling concern for a badly injured and disoriented character (Butters) who is also present on stage \u2013 a reference to the American culture's acceptance of violence while maintaining a taboo against nudity.[89] During the 2004 MTV Video Music Awards, comedian Dave Chappelle joked that his appearance on the VMAs was \"the biggest mistake [MTV made] since [they] put Janet Jackson on the Super Bowl.\"[90] Family Guy also did an episode based around the \"wardrobe malfunction\" and the FCC's crackdown on \"indecent\" content, with one scene parodying the incident directly.[91] The fourth season episode \"PTV\" involved actor David Hyde Pierce having a trouser malfunction at the Emmys. The FCC's sudden crackdown on indecent material on television leads an angered Peter Griffin to start his own network with looser content standards, PTV, on which later in the same episode, he presents a show called the \"Side Boob Hour\" which among other risque programs he puts on leads his objected wife Lois to call the FCC to crack down on PTV (leading to the implication of the FCC also regulating what his family says and does).\n\nThe halftime show continued to be a subject of discussion in 2005. At the beginning of 2005, the parody newspaper The Onion ran as its headline article for January 26, 2005, \"U.S. Children Still Traumatized One Year After Seeing Partially Exposed Breast On TV\". The article's satirical target was the nation's reaction to the incident, rather than the incident itself.[92] On February 1, 2005, exactly one year after the halftime show, the PTC released a report titled MTV Smut Peddlers: Targeting Kids with Sex, Drugs, and Alcohol, covering MTV programming during the network's \"Spring Break\" week from March 20 to 27, 2004, accusing MTV of irresponsibly promoting sex, drugs and alcohol to impressionable youth. In response to the report, MTV network executive Jeannie Kedas argued that the report \"underestimates young people's intellect and their level of sophistication.\"[93] On February 6, however, New York Times columnist Frank Rich argued that censorship on television was becoming more prevalent following the halftime show in his February 6, 2005 column \"The Year of Living Indecently\". Examples he cited included more than 60 ABC-affiliated stations (including those owned by the E. W. Scripps Company, Hearst-Argyle Television and Cox Broadcasting) refusing to broadcast Saving Private Ryan due to the profanity prevalent throughout the film, which was to be aired unedited in its entirety by the network, and PBS editing obscene language out of certain programs such as the British terrorist drama Dirty War.[94] The ESPN series Playmakers was also immediately forced to be canceled by the NFL following the incident.[95][96] A commercial from Budweiser, which depicted a man opening a beverage on the outfit's breastplate and tearing it before it was worn, was intended to be aired during Super Bowl XXXIX the following year, but was pulled before its broadcast.[97][98]\n\nCanada [ edit ]\n\nIn Canada, where the Super Bowl telecast was broadcast by the Global Television Network, the incident passed largely without controversy: only about 50 Canadians complained about the incident to the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC).[99] The CBSC received roughly twice as many complaints about other aspects of the Super Bowl broadcast, including music and advertising issues (though some were expected complaints about Canadian content/simsub issues preventing viewing of the popular American advertisements, which is a common issue among Canadian viewers of the Super Bowl to the present day).[100] Professor Robert Thompson, director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television at Syracuse University, stated: \"I know many people in other countries are scratching their heads and thinking 'What in the world is the big fuss over there?'\"[101]\n\nNew Zealand [ edit ]\n\nNew Zealand news outlets re-broadcast the \"nipplegate\" moment (some in slow motion) with commentary explaining that American ultra-conservatives had made the incident into a major controversy. The nation's largest newspaper, the New Zealand Herald, ran an op-ed from a New Zealander living in the US detailing his bafflement at his American friends, who had expressed outrage at the glimpse of nipple while supporting their country's invasion of Iraq and being fans of the television show Sex and the City.[102]\n\nLegal action [ edit ]\n\nOn February 4, Terri Carlin, a banker residing in Knoxville, Tennessee, filed a class action lawsuit against Jackson and Timberlake on behalf of \"all American citizens who watched the outrageous conduct\". The lawsuit alleged that the halftime show contained \"sexually explicit acts solely designed to garner publicity and, ultimately, to increase profits for themselves\". The lawsuit sought maximum punitive and compensatory damages from the performers. Carlin later dropped the lawsuit.[103] Three months later, Eric Stephenson, a lawyer from Farmington, Utah, filed a US$5,000 lawsuit in small-claims court against Viacom for false advertising of the Super Bowl halftime show, as he, the father of three young children, claimed that pre-game advertising led him to believe that the halftime show would consist of marching bands, balloons and a patriotic celebration.[104] The lawsuit was rejected because Stephenson should have filed a federal lawsuit or complaint to the FCC, which was already investigating the halftime show.[105]\n\nAmerica Online, the Internet service provider that sponsored the halftime show, demanded a refund of the approximately US$7.5 million that it paid to sponsor and advertise on the halftime show. However, no other advertisers of the Super Bowl had similar demands.[106]\n\nThe halftime show led to a great spike in FCC-issued fines and received complaints compared to those from previous years.\n\nThe incident triggered a rash of fines that the FCC levied soon after the Super Bowl, alleging that the context of the \"wardrobe malfunction\" was intended \"to pander, titillate and shock those watching\" because it happened within the lyrics within Timberlake's performance of Rock Your Body: \"Hurry up 'cause you're taking too long ... better have you naked by the end of this song.\"[107] In addition, the FCC cited a news article on MTV's website (MTV.com) claiming that the halftime show would promise \"shocking moments\"[108] and that \"officials of both CBS and MTV were well aware of the overall sexual nature of the Jackson/Timberlake segment, and fully sanctioned it \u2013 indeed, touted it as 'shocking' to attract potential viewers\".[107] CBS, however, argued that the exposure was unplanned,[109] although in later statements CBS asserted that while the exposure was unplanned by CBS, it was deliberately planned by Timberlake and Jackson \"independently and clandestinely\".[110] On September 22, 2004, the FCC fined Viacom the maximum penalty of US$27,500 for each of the 20 CBS-owned television stations (including satellites of WFRV in Green Bay, WCCO in Minneapolis and KUTV in Salt Lake City; current CBS owned-and-operated station KOVR in Sacramento at the time was owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group) for a fine totaling US$550,000, the largest ever placed against a television broadcaster at that time.[4][111] However, the Parents Television Council[112] and even some of the FCC commissioners[107] criticized the Commission for fining only 20 CBS stations, not all of them, for the halftime show. 66% of respondents to a March 2005 Time magazine poll believed that the FCC overreacted to the halftime show by fining CBS.[113]\n\nOn November 24, 2004, Viacom paid out US$3.5 million to settle outstanding indecency complaints and stated that it would challenge the US$550,000 penalty related to the incident, on the grounds that the broadcast was unintentional and thus exempt from indecency regulation.[114] In March 2006, the FCC affirmed that the Super Bowl halftime show was indecent,[115] so CBS paid the FCC's issued fine in July 2006 in order to take their appeal against their fine to federal court.[116] CBS appealed the fine on September 17 at the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals in Philadelphia.[117]\n\nOn July 21, 2008, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled[118] in favor of CBS, voiding the FCC's fine on the grounds that the enforcement involved a significant deviation from prior practice that was not announced as a clear policy change.[119][120][121] On May 4, 2009, however, the Supreme Court vacated and remanded the case back to the Third Circuit for reconsideration in light of the previously decided Federal Communications Commission v. Fox Television Stations (2009).[122][123]\n\nOn November 2, 2011, the Third Circuit Court ruled 2\u20131 that its earlier decision was correct, citing that the broadcast was legal under the FCC's then-current policy of allowing \"fleeting\" indecency on the airwaves, and that it was unfair of the FCC to change the policy retroactively.[5][124] On June 29, 2012, the Supreme Court declined an FCC appeal.[125]\n\nOther controversies [ edit ]\n\nCommercials [ edit ]\n\nPrior to the broadcast, CBS rejected the MoveOn.org Super Bowl ad Bush in 30 Seconds because it was deemed too controversial. CBS stated that it had a \"decades-old\" policy of rejecting advertisements regarding \"controversial issues of public importance\", although MoveOn charged that the networks had previously accepted similar advertisements from other groups.[126] The Super Bowl broadcast featured numerous commercials for erectile dysfunction medicines and advertisements for Anheuser-Busch's Bud Light brand featuring a flatulating horse and a dog attacking male genitalia; however, no politically charged advertisements appeared during the telecast.[127] CBS, which also held the rights to Super Bowl XLIV, later aired a commercial during that game featuring then-Florida Gators quarterback Tim Tebow and his mother that discreetly refer to their pro-life viewpoints. The ad, sponsored by Focus on the Family, received similar controversy.[128][129] In a league-mandated policy meant to clear the airwaves of such advertisements, the NFL announced that those types of commercials would not air again during Super Bowl broadcasts (the league ended an advertising relationship with Levitra in March 2007 as an official league sponsor).[130]\n\nIn January 2005, Fox, the network that carried Super Bowl XXXIX under the NFL's alternating network contract for the championship game, rejected an advertisement for the cold remedy Airborne that briefly featured the naked buttocks of veteran actor Mickey Rooney.[94]\n\nStreaking [ edit ]\n\nMoments after the Jackson-Timberlake tangle, streaker Mark Roberts added to the controversial halftime by running around the field naked except for some writing on his body which read \"SUPER BOWEL\" on the front, an advertisement for an online betting website, and a well-placed G-string attached to half of a miniature football covering Roberts' genitals.[131] Part of Roberts' stunt was broadcast in the United States; CBS chose to keep its cameras in a wide-shot view of the stadium and use quick cutaways to players and coaches as Roberts ran around the field until players from both competing teams, the New England Patriots and the Carolina Panthers, tackled him. Matt Chatham, the Patriots' special teams expert and reserve linebacker initially knocked Roberts down, thus allowing stadium security and police to arrest Roberts and take him into custody.[132]\n\nOther performers [ edit ]\n\nAside from Jackson's exposure, minor controversy around the show's other performances included rappers P. Diddy and Nelly gesturing towards their crotches[citation needed], stripping cheerleaders[citation needed], and musician Kid Rock appearing in a poncho made from a slit American flag, which he later threw towards the audience.[2][133] U.S. Senator Zell Miller complained that Kid Rock's outfit was a desecration of the American flag.[134]\n\nAftermath and effects [ edit ]\n\nCensorship and regulation of broadcasting [ edit ]\n\nWebsite Soap Opera Central speculated that the fallout from this incident may have had a subtle effect on daytime television. These television shows are known for \"love in the afternoon\" and regularly feature romantic couplings; shortly before the Super Bowl, the Procter & Gamble soap operas As the World Turns and Guiding Light had gone as far as featuring rear male nudity during sexual scenes. After the Super Bowl controversy, FCC commissioner Michael J. Copps stated that it was time for a crackdown on inappropriate sexual content in daytime television, and indicated that he was reviewing whether soap operas were violating the agency's indecency prohibitions.[135]\n\nTwo other major sporting events that followed the Super Bowl that year also were forced to censor their respective halftime shows following the incident. The Pro Bowl, which would be played on February 8 at Aloha Stadium in Hawaii, originally was to feature singer JC Chasez, who was a member of boy band 'N Sync as was Timberlake, sing the National Anthem before the game and perform his hit song \"Blowin' Me Up (with Her Love)\" at halftime. However, the NFL did not allow Chasez to perform during halftime due to the sexually suggestive content of his chosen song (even though the game was carried by ESPN, which is not under the content purview of the FCC as it is a cable network, and therefore only self-regulates content as an advertiser-supported service), replacing it with traditional Hawai\u02bbian dancers.[136][137] The 2004 NBA All-Star Game also censored its act, despite being broadcast on TNT (which in reiteration, is not bound by FCC content regulations as a cable network), having halftime performer Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles perform \"Crazy in Love\" rather than \"Naughty Girl\", which they feared would incite controversy given its sexual content. Jackson was in attendance at the game, and dressed conservatively.[138] The networks that were to broadcast the 46th Grammy Awards (CBS) and the 76th Academy Awards (ABC), live events scheduled for February 8 and February 29 respectively, enhanced their broadcast delays to accommodate editing of inappropriate video in addition to audio.[139][140]\n\nFollowing these announcements, Guiding Light edited out nudity from an episode that had already been taped. A week later, the show's executive producer John Conboy was fired and replaced by Ellen Wheeler. All nine American network soaps began to impose an unwritten rule of avoiding any sort of risqu\u00e9 adult scenes, and in the months following, editors of soap opera periodical Soap Opera Digest wrote about how daytime television was losing its steam.[135] NBC also re-edited a scene from an episode of its medical drama ER where paramedics were wheeling an elderly woman into the hospital, and her breast could be seen non-explicitly in the context of her injury and treatment.[141] Even as late as Veterans Day (November 11) of 2004, 65 ABC-affiliated stations pre-empted the uncut network presentation of the film Saving Private Ryan over concerns about the film's violent and profane content and FCC regulations. Benjamin Svetkey of Entertainment Weekly quoted L. Brent Bozell III and Peggy Noonan associating the mass pre-emption of Ryan with the halftime show incident.[142] The annual Victoria's Secret Fashion Show was cancelled for that year in reaction to the incident.[143]\n\nA petition was filed by a consortium of broadcasters (which included Viacom) and the RIAA over an FCC indecency ruling, regarding fleeting expletives uttered by Bono of U2 when accepting an award at the 60th Golden Globe Awards in 2003. It argued that the FCC had implemented a standard \"that would allow it to censor all kinds of things \u2014 anything considered blasphemous, coarse or vulgar\", and observed that many radio stations, especially rock-formatted stations, had been engaging in self-censorship by censoring or removing songs from their libraries, so that they would not run afoul of the stricter regulation.[144] Clear Channel Communications removed talk-radio host Howard Stern from several of its large-market radio stations within a month of the incident, citing the raunchy content of Stern's show. The FCC fined Clear Channel over allegedly indecent content on the Bubba the Love Sponge radio show.[145] As a result of the incident, some networks established regulations requiring time delays of as much as five minutes for live broadcasts such as awards shows and sporting events.[146] In late 2004, the United States House of Representatives passed a bill to raise the maximum FCC fine penalty from said US$27,500 to US$500,000 per violation; the United States Senate voted to decrease it to US$275,000 per incident, with a cap of US$3 million per day.[4] By June 2006, the two houses reconciled the differences in fine levels, settling for a fine of US$325,000 per violation in the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act of 2005.[14]\n\nThe incident also prompted tighter control over content by station owners and managers. Viacom, at the center of the controversy, also employed the controversial Howard Stern in its radio division (at the time called Infinity Broadcasting). The expanding control on content is said to be a contributing factor that drove Stern away from terrestrial radio and onto Sirius Satellite Radio, and is sometimes credited as the media figure most responsible for introducing a new era in radio.[8] It has also been reported that some teen-oriented awards shows in the summer of 2004 had also been purged of most sexual and profane content that had been perceived as staples in such awards telecasts in the past, including Fox's Teen Choice Awards and MTV's self-created Video Music Awards.[90] Author Frederick S. Lane stated in an interview with John Eggerton of Broadcasting & Cable magazine that the controversy surrounding the halftime show was the primary inspiration for his 2006 book The Decency Wars: The Campaign to Cleanse American Culture, which explains moral controversies in the American media over the years.[147]\n\nThe Super Bowl itself would not feature a modern act for its halftime show for the next six years, opting instead for classic rockers such as Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones, Prince, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, and The Who (McCartney, the Stones and The Who were all part of the British Invasion of the 1960s). In fact, no women performed at the Super Bowl halftime show at all until The Black Eyed Peas performed in 2011.\n\nIn 2012, during the halftime show for Super Bowl XLVI, rapper M.I.A. pointed up her middle finger during her performance. That incident drew comparisons with the exposure of Janet Jackson's breast in the Super Bowl halftime show eight years prior. The Associated Press asserted that people learned what M.I.A. did only when reports surfaced in the media and quoted TV critic James Poniewozik: \"I had no idea she even did it until NBC issued an apology for it.\"[148] NBC blurred the entire screen albeit a second too late to obscure M.I.A. giving the finger.[149] The NFL ultimately sued M.I.A. for US$1.5 million on breach of contract grounds.[8] The lawsuit was settled in August 2014 and the terms of the settlement remained private.[150] As an indication of the reduced level of complaints, only 222 complaints were filed over the incident.[151]\n\nSports broadcasting [ edit ]\n\nSports would be greatly affected by the controversy. Three weeks later, NASCAR announced at the driver and crew chief meeting at North Carolina Speedway that it would stiffen penalties on use of improper language or gestures including larger fines, loss of points (if it occurred in a post-race interview or after the driver fell out of a race), ejection of a team from the race, or lap penalties (if in-race) under the circuit's \"detrimental to NASCAR\" rule.[152] Johnny Sauter was fined US$10,000 and 25 points a week after the new rule took in effect for obscene language in an interview. Later in 2004, Dale Earnhardt, Jr. received a 25-point penalty and a US$50,000 fine when he used an obscenity after winning the 2004 EA Sports 500 at Talladega Superspeedway. He lost the championship lead after that incident and lost the championship by 100 points after the incident. In 2007, Tony Stewart received a similar penalty after using an obscenity in a post-race interview following his Brickyard 400 win. Kyle Busch, in November 2010, was fined US$25,000 for an obscene gesture caught on ESPN, along with an in-race two-lap penalty, as the gesture was aimed at a NASCAR official.\n\nThe NFL also came under some smaller controversies over its telecasts. The FCC received a complaint about Fox's telecast of a January 2005 playoff game between the Green Bay Packers and Minnesota Vikings; the complainant alleged that Minnesota player Randy Moss, who scored a touchdown, apparently made movements appearing to moon the spectators. However, the FCC denied the complaint because Moss was fully clothed at all times, and his gestures were shown for only a few seconds, thus warranting that the display was not indecent; game announcer Joe Buck also immediately condemned the act (and additionally, Moss was fined by the NFL).[153] On January 13, 2007, during Fox's coverage of an NFL playoff game between the New Orleans Saints and Philadelphia Eagles, the camera cut to the stands, showing for four seconds a shirt with the words \"Fuck DA EAGLES\" that was worn by a female spectator. That drew a backlash from the Parents Television Council, which filed complaints with the FCC.[154]\n\nDuring NBC's live broadcast of Super Bowl XLIII on February 1, 2009, the five-year anniversary of the original incident, affiliate KVOA-TV's analog broadcast feed (the high definition feed of the station was unaffected) over Comcast's Tucson, Arizona system was interrupted by an unknown party, when an excerpt of a film aired by adult cable channel Shorteez was broadcast for 30 seconds to local Comcast subscribers just after Larry Fitzgerald scored his fourth-quarter touchdown to take the Cardinals to a 23\u201320 lead. Afterwards, 10 seconds of an end credit segment from ClubJenna (which, like Shorteez, is owned by Playboy Enterprises) was shown.[155] Comcast offered a US$10 credit for customers who claimed to have seen the incident,[156] and the Federal Communications Commission announced that it would investigate the cause of the incident. E! Online columnist Josh Grossberg stated: \"This almost makes us nostalgic for the days of Nipplegate.\"[157]\n\n2004 presidential election [ edit ]\n\nFrederick S. Lane argued in his 2006 book The Decency Wars that the Super Bowl halftime show controversy influenced the primary focus on \"moral values\" and \"media decency\" in the 2004 Democratic Party primaries.[158] Jackson claimed the incident was used in the media as a diversion for President George W. Bush's poor approval ratings and the Iraq War, with Bush and First Lady Laura Bush giving public commentary on the incident rather than focusing on other issues.[31]\n\nImpact on Jackson [ edit ]\n\n\"[We are] absolutely bailing on the record [...] The pressure is so great, they can't align with anything related to Janet. The high-ups are still pissed at her, and this is a punitive measure.\" \"[...] radio wouldn't play it and MTV wouldn't play her videos for \"I Want You\" and \"All Nite\", two songs that would've been out-of-the-park hits at any other point in Jackson's career.\" \u2013 Viacom revealing Jackson's blacklist; commentary from The Charlotte Observer[31]\n\nViacom, which owned MTV, CBS and Infinity Broadcasting at the time, enforced a blacklist of Jackson's singles and music videos on their radio stations and television networks; this largely affected her chart performance throughout the course of her eighth studio album Damita Jo released the same year, as well as her following two albums 20 Y.O. and Discipline.[31][75][159][160]\n\nJackson was intended to appear at the 46th Grammy Awards, which was being held the following week and televised by CBS, but her invitation was withdrawn due to the incident. Jackson was originally scheduled to appear as a presenter for a tribute to Luther Vandross, performed by Celine Dion, Richard Marx and Alicia Keys, and was chosen due to previously collaborating with Vandross on the number-one hit \"The Best Things in Life Are Free\". According to People Magazine, Jackson \"had been slated to speak before the accolade but was being pressured to bow out gracefully \u2013 or face being uninvited\", before later being completely barred from attending. However, Timberlake was still allowed to attend and perform at the event.[161][162] The majority of the artists at the ceremony were also asked to comment on Jackson's incident.[163] Jackson had also been cast to play Lena Horne in a movie about the singer and activist's life, which was to be produced by ABC, but was forced to resign following the performance incident.[59] A statue of Mickey Mouse wearing Jackson's iconic \"Rhythm Nation\" outfit was mantled at Walt Disney World theme park the previous year to honor Jackson's legacy, but was removed following Jackson's controversial performance. A spokesman for Disney said, \"Considering all the controversy [the performance] drew, we talked it over for a couple of days and decided it would be best to replace hers with a new one.\"[164]\n\nIn her first interview since the incident, Jackson appeared on CBS's Late Show with David Letterman on March 29, 2004, which increased the show's ratings over 20%.[165] In April 2004, Jackson poked fun at herself in an appearance on Saturday Night Live, first while playing Condoleezza Rice in a skit, nervously answering a question by exposing her right breast (which was pixelated by NBC), and again by viewing a mock home video from her childhood in which her bathing suit top came off in a wading pool, calling it a \"swimsuit malfunction\".[159][166] An NBC spokesman said Jackson was wearing a bra beneath her blouse during the skit.[167] During a performance on ABC's Good Morning America, the network promoted Jackson's appearance as her \"first live performance since the Super Bowl\", hinting at the chance of shock value. Blender Magazine recalled \"Photographers and camera crews are packed in, in case Jackson decides to show us the left one. And if all eyes (and cameras) are on her chest, Jackson, 38, responds defiantly by refusing to cloak her breasts in a modest turtleneck. The cleavage is her way of saying 'fuck you.'\"[31] In 2006, during an interview on The Oprah Winfrey Show, Jackson upheld her claim that the Super Bowl scandal was an accident.[168]\n\nJanet Jackson's first album released following the Super Bowl incident was Damita Jo, her eighth studio album. A majority of the reviews for the album, including those by AllMusic, the BBC, Entertainment Weekly, The Guardian and The New York Times focused on the negative backlash suffered by Jackson as a result of the incident but gave favorable reviews to the album itself.[169][170][171] Blender Magazine considered the album's success to be \"a minor-chord \"F-you\" victory to the wolves nipping at Janet's tits.\"[31]\n\nDespite the blacklisting, Damita Jo was a success and certified Platinum, selling over three million copies worldwide and also receiving a Grammy nomination. Singles from the album like \"Just a Little While\" and \"All Nite (Don't Stop)\" reached #1 on the Hot Dance Club Songs chart. Although receiving positive reception, the incident also affected the performance of following albums 20 Y.O. and Discipline due to the blacklist. However, 20 Y.O. managed to sell over 1.5 million copies worldwide, was certified Platinum in the US and received a Grammy nomination.[46][172] Additionally, \"Feedback\" reached the top 20 pop hit on the Billboard Hot 100, selling one million copies worldwide. Subsequent releases \"Make Me\" peaked atop the Hot Dance Club Songs and top 20 internationally; \"Nothing\" reached #1 on the digital pop and music video charts, also considered for an Oscar nomination.[159]\n\nImpact on Timberlake [ edit ]\n\nImmediately following the incident Timberlake jokingly dismissed it, telling the inquisitive press: \"[Jackson and I] love giving you all something to talk about.\"[50] His attitude quickly changed as the scandal grew into a serious controversy. People Magazine stated Timberlake was referred to as \"the Teflon man\" at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards because the incident did not affect him as it did with Jackson.[59] In a 2006 interview with MTV, Timberlake said that compared to the huge backlash Jackson suffered, he himself received only about 10% of the blame; and he accused American society of being both \"harsher on women\" and \"unfairly harsh on ethnic people\".[72] Prior to plans for the Super Bowl performance, Jackson and Timberlake had discussed potentially recording a duet for Jackson's Damita Jo album, as well as a rumored collaboration for a Quincy Jones album, though neither came to fruition.[173][174] In November 2013, Timberlake performed a cover of Jackson's \"Let's Wait Awhile\" on The 20/20 Experience World Tour before transitioning into his song \"Until the End of Time\", which was regarded as a sign of affection or apology to Jackson.[175]\n\nMedia commentators stated Jackson was treated too harshly by the media and public, while Timberlake's career was not affected much by the incident. Shannon L. Holland in Women's Studies in Communication argued that the media reaction after the incident focused disproportionately on Jackson, \"represent[ing] her as a contemporary Jezebel in that her racial and gendered Otherness was often juxtaposed with the 'normalcy' of Timberlake's white masculinity. That is, she emerged in a public discourse as the primary (if not sole) instigator of the lewd act, a scheming seductress who manipulated Timberlake for her own economic gain.\"[176] In 2014, former FCC chairman Michael Powell, who had enforced fines on the conglomerates involved with the broadcast following the incident, stated: \"I personally thought that was really unfair. It all turned into being about her. In reality, if you slow the thing down, it's Justin ripping off her breastplate.\"[58] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone stated \"Justin isn't exactly Mr. Loyalty -- he totally left Janet Jackson to take the heat after the Super Bowl.'\"[177] E! Online also commented \"Timberlake wasted no time placing the bulk of the blame for the incident on Jackson. And, of course, the woman takes the blame even though the man stripped her. Pathetically typical.\"[69][178] A reporter for VH1 said \"JT still gets a side eye for leaving her out to dry.\"[179]\n\nOne observer claimed \"Despite her 'wardrobe malfunction' \u2013 for which we think Justin Timberlake wasn't punished nearly as severely for \u2013 Janet put on a pretty amazing show.\"[180] The New York Times noted \"[a]fter her right breast upstaged the Super Bowl, she was criticized by the first lady, vilified by media executives and abandoned by her co-conspirator, Justin Timberlake; less excitable commentators suggested she was merely a shrewd publicity-stunt woman with a new album to promote.\"[171] Jackson's parents, Joe and Katherine Jackson, also expressed concern that Timberlake did not stand by Janet following the incident, commenting, \"What I didn't like is there wasn't one person on that stage, there were two people. After a while, there was only Janet Jackson. That's all there was. Janet Jackson,\" adding \"Janet don't pull that thing open herself. He did it. We were surprised that they didn't say anything to Justin about it.\"[181]\n\nTimberlake would eventually be invited back to the Super Bowl halftime show when he was named headlining act for the Super Bowl LII halftime show in February 2018.[182] During his performance, Timberlake again sang a portion of \"Rock Your Body,\" but stopped right before reaching the \"I'm gonna have you naked by the end of this song\" lyric, saying \"hold up! Stop!\" and smiling.[183] Some commentators interpreted this as a subtle reference to the 2004 incident.[184][185]\n\nPopular culture [ edit ]\n\nPop singer Katy Perry parodied Jackson's Super Bowl incident in the music video for her single \"Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)\" during a scene where Perry's breast is accidentally exposed at a school event.[186][187] Jackson's incident is also recreated in Eminem's \"Ass Like That\" music video. The controversy and sexual nature surrounding Miley Cyrus' performance of \"We Can't Stop\" and \"Blurred Lines\"/\"Give It 2 U\" with guest artist Robin Thicke at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards was likened to Jackson's performance with Timberlake at the Super Bowl event.[188]\n\nThe term \"wardrobe malfunction\", which was developed to describe Jackson's incident in a public statement and was later added to the Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, has influenced media by frequently being used by various entertainers and publications when describing revealing outfits or, more so, accidental public exposures or nudity. The term's frequent usage following the incident has led to numerous entertainment outlets compiling various celebrity \"wardrobe malfunctions\", with Jackson included in the lists as the most infamous example and originator of the term.[189][190]\n\nSeveral songs have mentioned Jackson's performance, most notably Drake in Birdman's \"Money to Blow\" and Eminem's \"Ass Like That\", as well as Drake's \"Zone\", Tyga's \"Tyga Montana\", 50 Cent's \"Just a Touch\", Kanye West in Mase's \"Be Alright (Welcome Back Remix)\", Tech N9ne's \"Pornographic\" and \"Flash\", T-Pain's \"Therapy\", Chamillionaire's \"Talking That Talk\", and Common in Jadakiss's \"Why? (Remix) and in Lil Wayne's \"Grindin\"\".\n\nJustin Timberlake referenced the incident when ripping off part of Kristen Wiig's outfit during an appearance on Saturday Night Live in 2009.[191] The Family Guy episode \"PTV\" was written as a parody of the FCC's strict measures and regulations following Jackson's Super Bowl halftime show performance controversy.[192] A scene from the episode involving the fictional portrayal of an extreme reaction to actor David Hyde Pierce having a wardrobe malfunction at the Emmy Awards was also a recreation and reference to the incident.[193] Jackson's performance is again referenced in a brief scene where Peter Griffin is dressed in Jackson's Super Bowl outfit and has his breast exposed by Justin Timberlake during the musical number \"The Freaking FCC\".[194] The song itself was introduced when Lois called the FCC in response to a PTV show called \"The Side Boob Hour.\" The episode received Primetime Emmy Award and Annie Award nominations for its subject matter. Jackson's performance also inspired the South Park episode \"Good Times with Weapons\". In the episode, the show's creators draw attention to the media and public's unnecessary reaction to Jackson's brief exposure while disregarding or accepting extreme acts of violence during a scene where the public is outraged when Eric Cartman is seen naked and having a \"wardrobe malfunction\" on stage, while character Butters Stotch is ignored although he is bleeding and severely injured. Several game shows have also mentioned Jackson's performance.\n\nSeveral presenters at award shows have referenced the incident, including Anna Nicole Smith at the first annual MTV Australia Video Music Awards, Dave Chappelle at the MTV Video Music Awards, and singer Alanis Morissette at the Juno Awards, commenting, \"It's disturbing and curious to me to see what came of that. We're all sexual beings, and if we don't let it out organically, we repress ourselves. If we repress anger, it turns to depression. If we repress our sexuality, it turns to pornography and rape. To think that the country was in an uproar because of a nipple.\"[90][195] Comedian Russell Brand referenced the incident when hosting the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards, saying \"I can almost guarantee a Janet Jackson-style Super Bowl nip slip.\"[196]\n\nLegacy [ edit ]\n\nThe Super Bowl XXXVIII incident is considered to be the most controversial television and media event to occur within popular culture, and Jackson was regarded as the world's \"most controversial musician\" who was \"changing the cultural landscape\" due to the incident's massive effect on censorship and broadcasting in television and entertainment.[197] The performance incident made \"Janet Jackson\" the most searched term, event and image in Internet history.[21][22] Jackson was later listed in the 2007 edition of Guinness World Records as \"Most Searched in Internet History\" and the \"Most Searched for News Item\".[26] It also broke the record for \"most searched event over one day\".[25] 'Janet Jackson' also became the most searched term and person for 2004 and also of the following year.[23][24] It also set a record for being the most watched, recorded and replayed moment on TiVo.[198] A company representative stated \"The audience measurement guys have never seen anything like it. The audience reaction charts looked like an electrocardiogram.\"[28] Monte Burke of Forbes magazine reported, \"[t]he fleeting moment enticed an estimated 35,000 new [TiVo] subscribers to sign up.\"[29] Janet's Super Bowl halftime incident also coined the phrase \"wardrobe malfunction\", which was later officially added to the Webster's English Dictionary in 2008.[30] In the immediate aftermath of the incident, Entertainment Weekly stated \"Radio stations rushed to add Jackson's new single, \"Just a Little While\" to playlists on Monday following the incident [...] And USA Today reports that jewelry stores and piercing studios are seeing increased customer interest in silver sunburst-shaped nipple shields.\"[50]\n\nYouTube co-founder Jawed Karim revealed that his frustration at not being able to easily find a video clip of the incident provided the inspiration for the creation of YouTube, and later of Vevo.[19] The launch of Facebook commenced three days following the incident, in a potential attempt to capitalize on its publicity through social networking.[8]\n\nRolling Stone stated Jackson's Super Bowl performance \"is far and away the most famous moment in the history of the Super Bowl halftime show\".[199] PopCrush called the performance \"one of the most shocking moments in pop culture\" as well as a \"totally unexpected and unforgettable moment\".[200] Gawker ranked the performance among the most recent of the \"10 Shows that Advanced Sex on Television\", commenting the set \"had all the elements of a huge story\" and \"within seconds the world searched furtively for pictures\", concluding \"it remains so ubiquitous, it's impossible to look at a starburst nipple shield without thinking \"Janet Jackson\"\".[201] E! Online ranked it among the top ten most shocking celebrity moments of the prior two decades.[178] A study of television's most impactful moments of the last 50 years conducted by Sony Electronics and the Nielsen Television Research Company ranked Jackson's Super Bowl performance at #26. The incident was the only Super Bowl event on the list and the highest music and entertainment event aside from the death of Whitney Houston.[202] TV Guide Network ranked it at #2 in a 2010 special listing the \"25 Biggest TV Blunders\".[48] Complex stated \"It's the Citizen Kane of televised nip-slips \u2013 so unexpected, and on such a large stage, that nothing else will ever come close. If Beyonc\u00e9 were to whip out both breasts and put on a puppet show with them when she performs this year in New Orleans, it would rate as just the second most shocking Super Boob display. Janet's strangely ornamented right nipple is a living legend, and so is Justin Timberlake's terrified reaction.\"[203] Music channel Fuse listed it as the most controversial Super Bowl halftime show, saying the \"revealing performance remains (and will forever remain) the craziest thing to ever happen at a halftime show. Almost immediately after the incident, the FCC received a flood of complaints from parents who just wanted their children to enjoy a nice, wholesome three hours of grown men inflicting damaging and long-lasting pain on each other for sport. Halftime shows would never be the same.\"[204] Patrick Gipson of Bleacher Report ranked it as #1 in its list of the most \"Jaw Dropping Moments of the Last Decade\", stating Janet \"changed the landscape of live television forever\". Gipson explained \"It prompted a million mothers to cover their childrens' eyes, fathers and sons to jump out of their seats in shock and numerous sanctions by the Federal Communications Commission, including a US$550,000 fine against CBS. Talk about a halftime show that will be hard to top.\"[205] The incident was also declared \"the most memorable Super Bowl halftime show in history\", as well as \"the most controversial\", adding \"you can't talk about this halftime show, or any subsequent halftime show from here to eternity, without mentioning the wardrobe malfunction\".[206]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nGeneral"}
{"label": false, "txt": "Robert Pattinson has said that he would \u201cdefinitely\u201d return to the land of the big tentpole franchise but added that he believes independent cinema is going through a \u201csecond wave.\u201d\n\nThe Twilight star was in Berlin to promote Damsel, the western comedy from Kid-Thing directors David and Nathan Zellner, which is playing in competition at the festival. The film sees Pattinson play Samuel Alabaster, more greenhorn than pioneer, as he sets off on an adventure with the love of his life, Penelope, played by Mia Wasikowska.\n\nPattinson said he had a \u201cgreat time\u201d playing vampire Edward Cullen in the Twilight franchise and he wouldn\u2019t rule out more big-budget franchises. \u201cI\u2019ve not had a bad experience on any film I\u2019ve done, maybe one. The only reason I\u2019m a little cautious about big franchise films is that you can\u2019t make them R rated. If you have a big budget, there\u2019s more people on you to do it a [specific] way or you\u2019re fired. If you keep a budget contained, if people think they can get their money back, you can experiment more.\u201d\n\nHe added that he believed that there will be a \u201cresurgence\u201d of mid-budget movies that will allow actors to experiment more. \u201cPeople were scared when the streaming services came out, but, to me, it seems there\u2019s a second wave. There\u2019s a bunch of new studios, mid-budget filmmaking is coming back and it\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nPattison said he was attracted to Damsel as he was rarely offered roles in comedies. \u201cThere aren\u2019t that many western comedies. In terms of the comedies, it\u2019s tough to find one that has an interesting character, you\u2019re usually playing for laughs. There\u2019s such a stable of comedy actors and I\u2019m not seen as a comedy actor so it will always go to a bunch of people before me. I found it so strange and felt like abstract version of a comedy and it appealed to me in the same way as a drama. It was really fun to play, it has an odd tone, so it was fun to try and figure out how to fit into it.\u201d\n\nDamsel starts off as a classic western, a horseback odyssey with plenty of shootouts. However, on his way looking for love, there\u2019s a twist: Penelope, it seems, is not a damsel in distress. Wasikowska called it \u201cvery clever.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were led to believe one thing about this character and that gets flipped on its head,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Zellners, who also directed 2008\u2019s Goliath and 2014\u2019s Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter, said that they were big fans of the western genre but didn\u2019t want to make another sepia-toned film. \u201cWe\u2019ve been fans of westerns since we were kids [but we were] bored of the clich\u00e9s and tropes. The female characters are usually pretty boring or a prize to be obtained by the hero and those elements were tiresome and not interesting so we wanted to make Penelope a complex human\u2026 and then amp it up for comedic purposes,\u201d said Nathan Zellner. Damsel is being by Great Point Media and ICM in Berlin.\n\nWasikowska and Pattinson were asked about the #MeToo campaign, which has been a prominent feature of the festival. Wasikowska said she thought it was \u201camazing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spent much of the last year in Australia so I\u2019ve been watching from afar,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Respect Rally in Sundance was the first thing I was able to be a part of. I think it\u2019s going to [lead to] really significant change.\u201d Pattinson added that being \u201cbullied into silence\u201d was one of the most awful things and that it was \u201camazing when any kind of dam breaks.\u201d\n\nPattinson can next be seen in Claire Denis\u2019 English-language debut High Life, alongside Juliette Binoche and Mia Goth. The sci-fi film, which is being sold by Wild Bunch and CAA at Berlin, follows a father and daughter struggling to survive in deep space."}

{"label": false, "txt": "Wonder Wheel is a 2017 American period drama film written and directed by Woody Allen, and starring Jim Belushi, Kate Winslet, Juno Temple, and Justin Timberlake. The film is set in the early 1950s at an amusement park on Coney Island, and named for the park's Ferris wheel. The story follows the second wife and the estranged daughter of a carousel operator as they both pursue affairs with a life guard.[4]\n\nThe film served as the closing night selection at the 55th New York Film Festival, on October 14, 2017,[5] and was released on December 1, 2017, by Amazon Studios.[6]\n\nPlot [ edit ]\n\nMickey Rubin, a Coney Island life guard with aspirations to be a playwright like Eugene O'Neill, narrates through the fourth wall. Carolina, the daughter of Humpty Rannell, arrives at the boardwalk looking for Ginny Rannell, her father's second wife who works as a waitress at the clam shack. She begs Ginny to let her live with them, but Ginny leaves it up to Humpty, who angrily kicked her out when she married her mobster boyfriend Frank and threw away her college education and chance for a better life. Carolina tells him she is on the run from Frank, who she believes wants to kill her because she gave evidence of mob activity to the FBI. Humpty lets her stay, on the condition that she saves money to return to college and better her life. Ginny gets her a waitress job where she works.\n\nGinny used to be an actress and was happily married, but caused her husband to divorce her by being unfaithful. She and Humpty are raising her young son Ritchie, a troubled boy who habitually gets in trouble by setting fires. She is unhappy with Humpty and living on the boardwalk, and has been carrying on an affair with Mickey for a few months. Humpty is an angry and loud recovering alcoholic who runs the Carousel ride, and goes fishing with his friends to bring dinner home. But he starts to find more joy and patience for life with Carolina around, and he pays for her to go to night school.\n\nMickey is attracted to Ginny because of her age and experience, and because he views her as a damsel in need of saving. He and Carolina accidentally meet some time later, and he becomes attracted by Carolina's story. He thinks he is in love with her, but is conflicted with his feelings for Ginny. Ginny steals money from Humpty to buy Mickey an expensive watch as a birthday present, which he refuses to accept. By this time, Ginny has become suspicious of Mickey's feelings for Carolina and is jealous.\n\nMobsters Angelo and Nick come around, asking Humpty, and the owner of the clam shack, about Carolina's whereabouts. Carolina takes Mickey on a date to a Brooklyn pizza parlor, and her boss innocently tells this to Angelo and Nick. Ginny telephones the pizza parlor to warn Carolina but begins to stutter, realizing her opportunity to have Carolina away from Mickey, and hangs up. Mickey tells Carolina the whole truth about his feelings for her and his affair. Instantly feeling compassionate for everyone involved, Carolina decides to walk home alone to process the information and decide what she should do, not wanting to hurt Ginny or her father or Mickey. We see Angelo and Nick's car following her as she leaves the pizza parlor.\n\nWhen Carolina does not come home, Humpty asks Mickey the next day if he saw her after the date. Mickey investigates, and finds out Ginny called the pizza parlor but did not speak. Piecing it together, he confronts Ginny, who has started drinking and getting made up in one of her glamorous stage costumes. She pulls a knife out of the drawer and asks Mickey to kill her, but he leaves. Humpty comes back, sinking back into alcoholism after the police found no trace of Carolina, and tells Ginny he needs her help again to function in life. He tries to find a positive outlook and invites her to meet his friends' wives on a fishing trip, but she coldly refuses, keeping their rut in life status quo.\n\nCast [ edit ]\n\nProduction [ edit ]\n\nCasting [ edit ]\n\nKate Winslet was the first actor who came on board for the film, in July 2016,[7][8] followed by Juno Temple and Jim Belushi.[9] Allen, describing the casting process, said that, \"The first person I cast was Kate Winslet, then I cast a young girl named Juno Temple who I thought very much of,\" and \"I cast Jim Belushi who I thought was absolutely perfect for it.\"[10] Talking about the film, Winslet \u2013 who was previously attached to Allen's 2005 drama film Match Point but left the project to spend more time with her family \u2013 said, \"I play the lead. My character is called Ginny, and she's a waitress in a clam house... It was probably like the second most stressful part I've ever played, but the experience itself was just utterly incredible.\"[11]\n\nAllen later signed Justin Timberlake in the role of a lifeguard,[12][13] saying that \"I was doing this film and I thought, who could I get that would be an interesting guy to play a lifeguard in about 1950? I was sitting and talking with my brain trust. Someone said, 'What about Justin Timberlake?'\"[10] On August 19, 2016, Tony Sirico joined the cast.[14] In September 2016, Jack Gore, Steve Schirripa, and Max Casella rounded out the cast of the film.[15][16][17]\n\nFilming [ edit ]\n\nPrincipal photography began in Coney Island on September 15, 2016.[18] On the same day, filming took place at Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn around Hudson Avenue and Gold Street.[19] Timberlake and Temple were spotted filming at Brighton Beach on September 16, 2016,[20] and Winslet and Timberlake filmed scenes at Coney Island on September 19, 2016.[21]\n\nRelease [ edit ]\n\nThe film premiered as the closing film of the New York Film Festival on October 14, 2017. It was theatrically released on December 1, 2017, the same day as Allen's 82nd birthday.[6]\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nBox office [ edit ]\n\nWonder Wheel grossed $1.4 million in the United States and Canada, and $13.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $14.9 million.[3]\n\nIn the United States the film made $125,570 from five theaters in its opening weekend (an average of $25,114), marking a 61% drop from Caf\u00e9 Society's debut the previous year.[22]\n\nIn France, the film was released on January 31, 2018 and sold 20,147 tickets on its opening day, marking the lowest of any Allen film in over 15 years.[23]\n\nCritical response [ edit ]\n\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 30% based on 180 reviews, with an average rating of 5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Wonder Wheel gathers a charming cast in an inviting period setting, but they aren't enough to consistently breathe life into a Woody Allen project that never quite comes together.\"[24] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 45 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[25]\n\nGraham Fuller for Screen International wrote a positive review, praising Allen, \"It would be going too far to say Wonder Wheel is an instant Woody Allen classic, but it\u2019s a reminder that he\u2019s still a force to be reckoned with.\"[26]\n\nPeter Travers of Rolling Stone gave Wonder Wheel three out of four stars, and lauded Winslet's performance, writing \"there are valid criticisms of Wonder Wheel as a film that feels more like a stage play \u2013 its claustrophobic atmosphere can be stifling. But even covering familiar ground, Allen finds the blunt truth at its core. As Ginny is stripped of her fantasies and exposed to the harsh glare of reality, Winslet stands her ground, as if to say attention must be paid. It should be. Her performance is absolutely astounding.\"[27]\n\nWriting for Entertainment Weekly, Chris Nash found the film to be relatively weak, giving it a C- rating, and stating: \"The love triangle is stagy and unfolds with way too many complications and betrayals. It's undercooked even by the filmmaker's own late-career standards. Yes, Coney Island has never looked more gorgeously golden-hued (thanks to cinematographer Vittorio Storaro), but Allen has seldom been less sharp.\"[28]\n\nAccolades [ edit ]"}

Following her divorce from actor Tom Cruise, Kidman has been married to singer Keith Urban since 2006.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nKidman was born 20 June 1967 in Honolulu, Hawaii, while her Australian parents were temporarily in the United States on student visas. Her father was Antony Kidman (1938\u20132014), a biochemist, clinical psychologist and author, who died of a heart attack in Singapore aged 75.[10][11][12][13] Her mother, Janelle Ann (n\u00e9e Glenny), is a nursing instructor who edited her husband's books and was a member of the Women's Electoral Lobby. Kidman's ancestry includes Irish, Scottish and English heritage.[14]\n\nBeing born in Hawaii, she was given the Hawaiian name \"H\u014dk\u016blani\". The inspiration for the name came from a baby elephant born around the same time at the Honolulu Zoo,[15] but the name is also a commonly used Hawaiian name for girls, Hokulani meaning \"Heavenly Star\".[16]\n\nAt the time of Kidman's birth, her father was a graduate student at the University of Hawai\u02bbi at M\u0101noa. He became a visiting fellow at the National Institute of Mental Health of the United States. Opposed to the war in Vietnam, Kidman's parents participated in anti-war protests while living in Washington, D.C.[17] The family returned to Australia when Kidman was four and her mother now lives on Sydney's North Shore. Kidman has a younger sister, Antonia Kidman, a journalist and TV presenter.[18]\n\nKidman attended Lane Cove Public School and North Sydney Girls' High School. She was enrolled in ballet at three and showed her natural talent for acting in her primary and high school years.[19] She says that she was first inspired to become an actress upon seeing Margaret Hamilton's performance as the Wicked Witch of the West in The Wizard of Oz.[20] Kidman has revealed that she was timid as a child, saying, \"I am very shy \u2013 really shy \u2013 I even had a stutter as a kid, which I slowly got over, but I still regress into that shyness. So I don't like walking into a crowded restaurant by myself; I don't like going to a party by myself.\"[21]\n\nShe initially studied at the Phillip Street Theatre in Sydney. At Philip Street, Kidman studied alongside Naomi Watts who had attended the same high school.[19] She also attended the Australian Theatre for Young People.[19] Here she took up drama, mime and performing in her teens, finding acting to be a refuge. Owing to her fair skin and naturally red hair, the Australian sun forced the young Kidman to rehearse in halls of the theatre. A regular at the Phillip Street Theatre, she received both encouragement and praise to pursue acting full-time.[22]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\n1983\u20131994: Career beginnings [ edit ]\n\nIn 1983, aged 16, Kidman made her film debut in a remake of the Australian holiday season favourite Bush Christmas.[22] By the end of 1983, she had a supporting role in the television series Five Mile Creek. In 1984, her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, which caused Kidman to halt her acting work temporarily while she studied massage so she could help her mother with physical therapy.[23] She began gaining popularity in the mid-1980s after appearing in several film roles, including BMX Bandits (1983), Watch the Shadows Dance (1987 aka Nightmaster), and the romantic comedy Windrider (1986), which earned Kidman attention due to her racy scenes. Also during the decade, she appeared in several Australian productions, including the soap opera A Country Practice[24] and the 1987 miniseries Vietnam.[25] She also made guest appearances on Australian television programs and TV movies.\n\nIn 1988, Kidman appeared in Emerald City, based on the play of the same name. The Australian film earned her an Australian Film Institute award for Best Supporting Actress. Kidman next starred with Sam Neill in Dead Calm (1989) as Rae Ingram, playing the wife of a naval officer. The thriller brought Kidman to international recognition; Variety commented: \"Throughout the film, Kidman is excellent. She gives the character of Rae real tenacity and energy.\"[26] Meanwhile, critic Roger Ebert noted the excellent chemistry between the leads, stating, \"Kidman and Zane do generate real, palpable hatred in their scenes together.\"[27] She followed that up with the Australian miniseries Bangkok Hilton. She next moved on to star alongside her then-boyfriend and future husband, Tom Cruise, in the 1990 auto racing film Days of Thunder, as a young doctor who falls in love with a NASCAR driver. It is Kidman's American debut and was among the highest-grossing films of the year.[28]\n\nIn 1991, she co-starred with Thandie Newton and former classmate Naomi Watts in the Australian independent film Flirting.[29] They portrayed high school girls in this coming of age story, which won the Australian Film Institute Award for Best Film.[30] That same year, her work in the film Billy Bathgate earned Kidman her first Golden Globe Award nomination, for Best Supporting Actress. The New York Times, in its film review, called her \"a beauty with, it seems, a sense of humor\".[31] The following year, she and Cruise re-teamed for Ron Howard's Irish epic Far and Away (1992), which was a modest critical[32][33] and commercial[34] success. In 1993, she starred in the thriller Malice opposite Alec Baldwin[35] and the drama My Life opposite Michael Keaton.[36]\n\n1995\u20132003: Worldwide recognition [ edit ]\n\nIn 1995, Kidman appeared her highest-grossing live-action film (as of 2018),[37] playing Dr. Chase Meridian, the damsel in distress, in the superhero film Batman Forever, opposite Val Kilmer as the film's title character. The same year Kidman starred in Gus Van Sant's critically acclaimed dark comedy To Die For, in which she played the murderous newcaster Suzanne Stone. Of Kidman's Golden Globe award-winning performance, Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said \"[she] brings to the role layers of meaning, intention and impulse. Telling her story in close-up \u2013 as she does throughout the film \u2013 Kidman lets you see the calculation, the wheels turning, the transparent efforts to charm that succeed in charming all the same.\"[38] Kidman next appeared in The Portrait of a Lady (1996), based on the novel of the same name, alongside Barbara Hershey, John Malkovich, and Mary-Louise Parker. The following year, she starred in the action-thriller The Peacemaker (1997) as White House nuclear expert Dr. Julia Kelly, opposite George Clooney. The film grossed $110,000,000 worldwide.[39][40] In 1998, she co-starred with Sandra Bullock in the poorly received fantasy Practical Magic as a modern-day witch.[41] Kidman returned to her work on stage the same year in the David Hare play The Blue Room, which opened in London.[42]\n\nIn 1999, Kidman reunited with then husband, Tom Cruise, to portray a married couple in Eyes Wide Shut, the final film of director Stanley Kubrick. The film was subject to censorship controversies due to the explicit nature of its sex scenes.[43] The film received further attention following Kubrick's death shortly before its release. After brief hiatus and a highly publicized divorce from Cruise,[44] Kidman returned to the screen to play a mail-order bride in the British-American drama Birthday Girl.[45] In 2001, Kidman played the cabaret actress and courtesan Satine in Baz Luhrmann's musical Moulin Rouge!, opposite Ewan McGregor. Her performance and her singing received positive reviews; Paul Clinton of CNN.com called it her best work since To Die For, and wrote \"[she] is smoldering and stunning as Satine. She moves with total confidence throughout the film [...] Kidman seems to specialize in \"ice queen\" characters, but with Satine, she allows herself to thaw, just a bit.\"[46] Subsequently, Kidman received her second Golden Globe Award, for Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, as well as many other acting awards and nominations. She also received her first Academy Award nomination, for Best Actress.\n\nAlso in 2001, she had a starring role in Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar's horror film The Others as Grace Stewart, a mother living in the Channel Islands during World War II who suspects her house is haunted. Grossing over $210,947,037 worldwide, the film also earned several Goya Awards award nominations, including a Best Actress nomination for Kidman. She received her second BAFTA[47] and fifth Golden Globe[48] nominations. Roger Ebert commented that \"Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar has the patience to create a languorous, dreamy atmosphere, and Nicole Kidman succeeds in convincing us that she is a normal person in a disturbing situation, and not just a standard-issue horror movie hysteric.\"[49] Kidman was named the World's Most Beautiful Person by People magazine[50]\n\nIn 2002, Kidman won critical praise for her portrayal of Virginia Woolf in Stephen Daldry's The Hours, which stars Meryl Streep and Julianne Moore. Kidman famously wore prosthetics that were applied to her nose making her almost unrecognisable playing the author during her time in 1920s England, and her bouts with depression and mental illness while trying to write her novel, Mrs. Dalloway. The film earned positive notices and several nominations, including for an Academy Award for Best Picture. The New York Times wrote that, \"Ms. Kidman, in a performance of astounding bravery, evokes the savage inner war waged by a brilliant mind against a system of faulty wiring that transmits a searing, crazy static into her brain\".[51] Kidman won numerous critics' awards, including her first BAFTA, third Golden Globe, and the Academy Award for Best Actress. As the first Australian actress to win an Academy Award, Kidman made a teary acceptance speech about the importance of art, even during times of war, saying, \"Why do you come to the Academy Awards when the world is in such turmoil? Because art is important. And because you believe in what you do and you want to honour that, and it is a tradition that needs to be upheld.\"[52]\n\nFollowing her Oscar win, Kidman appeared in three very different films in 2003. The first, a leading role in Dogville, by Danish director Lars von Trier, was an experimental film set on a bare soundstage. Though the film divided critics in the United States, Kidman still earned praise for her performance. Peter Travers of Rolling Stones magazine stated: \"Kidman gives the most emotionally bruising performance of her career in Dogville, a movie that never met a cliche it didn't stomp on.\"[53] The second was an adaptation of Philip Roth's novel The Human Stain, opposite Anthony Hopkins. Her third film was Anthony Minghella's war drama Cold Mountain. Kidman appeared opposite Jude Law and Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, playing Southerner Ada Monroe, who is in love with Law's character and separated by the Civil War. TIME magazine wrote, \"Kidman takes strength from Ada's plight and grows steadily, literally luminous. Her sculptural pallor gives way to warm radiance in the firelight\".[54] The film garnered several award nominations and wins for its actors; Kidman received her sixth Golden Globe nomination at the 61st Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress.[55]\n\n2004\u20132009: Continued success [ edit ]\n\nKidman in 2004\n\nIn 2004 she appeared in the film Birth, which received controversy over a scene in which Kidman shares a bath with her co-star, 10-year-old Cameron Bright.

I wanted to make a film where you understand love\".[56] Kidman earned her seventh Golden Globe nomination, for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Drama. That same year she appeared in the black comedy-science-fiction film The Stepford Wives, a remake of the 1975 film of the same name.

Heidi begins to realize that there\u2019s a whole other story behind the story she\u2019s been telling herself.\n\nBased on the popular podcast of the same name, \u201cHomecoming\u201d is created by Eli Horowitz and Micah Bloomberg.

The photos then became the catapult to the tabloid fabricating a whole story that is totally untrue.\n\nAs for Garner\u2019s anger about the relationship Ben and Elizabeth have, these claims are also completely false. Both Jennifer and Ben have been longtime friends with Weaver and the nurse is a trusted confidant to both.\n\nAs it seems, based on new claims, Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck are actually doing better than ever since their split 18 months ago. There have been many ups and downs, yet the estranged couple, who have remained amicable all the while, are said to be on the upswing.\n\nRadar Online shares details about Jen and Ben\u2019s current status.\n\nA source close to the stars stated to the publication, \u201cJennifer confided in a friend that she and Ben Affleck are getting along better than ever.\u201d Garner reportedly also stated, \u201cWe weren\u2019t having sex before, so now I get the best of both worlds!\u201d\n\nIt was a very difficult time when Jen and Ben announced their separation back in June of 2015. Following the announcement, the infamous nanny scandal then broke involving the former couple\u2019s nanny Christine Ouzounian. The source reminded that it was not the nanny who led to the split between Jen and Ben, stating \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the nanny\u2019s fault they split because they weren\u2019t having sex before that.\u201d\n\nJennifer Garner And Ben Affleck Spotted Together At Church Amid Reconciliation Rumors https://t.co/BUDBM66Yan \u2014 Lindsay Cronin (@GirlWithGossip) December 13, 2016\n\nJen, herself, even corroborated the fact that Ouzounian was not at all the cause of she and Ben\u2019s split. Garner spoke openly to Vanity Fair on the subject during her first interview after the two separated. It was also during this same interview that Garner was candid about her love for Ben and the love their children have for him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not Ben\u2019s job to make me happy. The main thing is these kids\u2014and we\u2019re completely in line with what we hope for them. Sure, I lost the dream of dancing with my husband at my daughter\u2019s wedding. But you should see their faces when he walks through the door. And if you see your kids love someone so purely and wholly, then you\u2019re going to be friends with that person.\u201d\n\nThe two have continued on co-parenting their three children-Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 4, and are sure to take family trips to remind their kids that they are still a unit and that both are present in their lives.\n\nThe most recent getaway for Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck with the little ones was a trip to Big Sky over the holidays\n\n[Featured Image by Jason Merritt/Getty Images]"}

Kate has gone out of her way to be friendly to Meghan, and Meghan has been very grateful for that.\"\n\nNicholl reports that Kate has shown Meghan \"the royal ropes ,\" introduced her to several of her favorite designers , and told the newly titled Duchess of Sussex that she's \"always welcome\" in Apartment 1A of Kensington Palace, where Kate and Prince William live with their children . \"Kate has her hands full with the children and baby, but ensures she makes time to touch base with Meghan,\" the source said.\n\nSee more: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle May Be Moving Into This Insta-Worthy Windsor Cottage\n\nPrince Harry and Kate Middleton have long shared a special bond.

{"label": false, "txt": "Taylor Swift\u2019s sixth studio album Reputation finally dropped, after months of hype. With 15 tracks, produced with pop hitmakers Max Martin, Shellback and Jack Antonoff, Swift\u2019s latest addition to her catalogue appears to mine her past and her present for material, switching moods between unapologetic love letter and defiant clapback. It\u2019s all sung over a series of synth-heavy beats, and sprinkled with tinges of 80s pop, catchy dubstep drops and dance-ready hooks. Read on for our analysis of each song of the new Reputation era.\n\n1. \u201c\u2026Ready For It?\u201d: Starting things off with a thumping bass line and rallying cry, \u201c\u2026Ready For It?\u201d also offers one of Swift\u2019s prettiest melodies. \u201cIn the middle of the night, in my dreams, you should see the things we do,\u201d she sings sweetly before switching into her new-era rap-singing. \u201cHe can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor,\u201d she insists, name-checking a famous \u2014 and drama-filled \u2014 pairing, and setting the scene for the rest of the album\u2019s investigation of the perils of stardom.\n\n2. \u201cEnd Game\u201d (featuring Ed Sheeran and Future): Swift tapped her good friend Sheeran for this slow-jam-style track, a self-reflective \u2014 and self-aware \u2014 plea to both the listener and a lover. \u201cI wanna be your end game,\u201d Swift sings off the top, allowing in a little vulnerability \u2014 before jumping into a rap-sung chorus. \u201cBig reputation, you and me we got big reputations,\u201d she chants, recognizing the baggage that her stardom brings (and name-checking the album\u2019s title, of course). Of-the-moment rapper Future of \u201cMask Off\u201d success adds in a slick verse, sticking to the love-against-the-odds theme. Swift goes on to sing she doesn\u2019t want to be an \u201cex-love\u201d and that she isn\u2019t into the drama; it\u2019s just her burden to bear.\n\nThis is peak Swift: emotionally open, but ready and willing to have some fun with the hype around her own persona. Sheeran\u2019s contribution comes in the form of another rap-sung verse in the same vein, seeming to reference his own relationship and the pitfalls that fame has placed in his path to love. His advice? Ignore the rumors.\n\n3. \u201cI Did Something Bad\u201d: Swift knows that her critics have strong opinions about her; after all, the album is called Reputation. And in the bombastic \u201cI Did Something Bad,\u201d she appears to address some of the narratives that have surrounded her. \u201cI never trust a narcissist, but they love me / So I play them like a violin, and I make it look oh so easy,\u201d she opens this one over a sharp string pluck. \u201cIf a man talks s\u2013t then I owe him nothing.\u201d Here is new-era Swift: holding her head high, unapologetic and fiercely protective of her own success.\n\nThen, a funky dubstep drop brings shades of her mega-hit \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\u201d into the mix. Heavily electronically manipulated, and punctuated with a strong beat, it\u2019s a banger of a track \u2014 and her defiant response to her detractors. \u201cI never trust a playboy, but they love me,\u201d she insists, stating matter of-factly that it\u2019s best to \u201cleave before you get left,\u201d and hinting that maybe her splashy former relationships weren\u2019t all they might have seemed. And then there\u2019s the kicker: \u201cThey\u2019re burning all the witches, even if you aren\u2019t one,\u201d she croons on an auto-tuned bridge. \u201cGo ahead and light me up.\u201d Of all the quotable lines in Swift\u2019s oeuvre, this one is right up there at the top for its blazing imagery.\n\n4. \u201cDon\u2019t Blame Me\u201d: If you\u2019re a fan of Avicii or Kygo\u2019s brand of un-rushed atmospheric electro-pop, you might like the rich, vibey notes Swift brings together in \u201cDon\u2019t Blame Me,\u201d a moody, dark song that starts out swinging and pretty, and builds into a gospel-backed EDM anthem. \u201cDon\u2019t blame me, love made me crazy / if it doesn\u2019t you ain\u2019t doin\u2019 it right,\u201d she sings emphatically. \u201cLord save me, my drug is my baby, I be using for the rest of my life.\u201d Swift has endured criticism for her relationships: the fact that she\u2019s in them, the fact that she sings about them. \u201cDon\u2019t Blame Me\u201d could be a clapback to that criticism, reminding listeners that the heart simply wants what it wants, as her friend Selena Gomez once said.\n\n5. \u201cDelicate\u201d: Swift is, appropriately enough, at her most fragile on \u201cDelicate.\u201d Refreshingly honest, it\u2019s a melodic electro-ballad with a resonant refrain. \u201cMy reputation\u2019s never been worse so, you must like me for me,\u201d she muses, her voice a light wisp, in a wry nod to her year in the spotlight before breaking down her insecurities: \u201cIs it cool that I said all that? Is it too soon to do this yet?\u201d Like pretty much anyone dealing with a new crush, Swift sings of moments of doubt. Perhaps even superstars have their sore spots. She couches this sweetly uncertain song in snippets of dates \u2014 at a dive bar, in her apartment \u2014 but keeps it about her circular internal monologue, always questioning just how much her feelings are being reciprocated.\n\n6. \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d: Swift\u2019s lead single \u2014 and immediate chart-topper following its release \u2014 \u201cLWYMMD\u201d was a shocking reintroduction to the Swift of Reputation: hard, unapologetic, focused on retribution. Step aside, \u201cBad Blood,\u201d this song is much more cutting. \u201cI\u2019ve got a list of names, and yours is in red, underlined,\u201d she reminded her haters over a Right Said Fred sample. The propulsive beat and insistence that the old Taylor was \u201cdead\u201d only sharpened her point.\n\n7. \u201cSo It Goes\u2026\u201d: Here, she switches things back to romance, reflecting on just how a new love interest might help her out of her fixations: \u201cyou make everyone disappear,\u201d she explains in the moody, murky opening segment, which opens into a trap-lite chorus about getting caught up in the moment (and, of course, leaving some signature lipstick \u201con your face\u201d). But for life with Swift, that\u2019s just how it goes. \u201cI\u2019m yours to keep, and yours to lose. You know I\u2019m not a bad girl, but I\u2019ll do bad things with you,\u201d she adds with a wink; this version of Swift has made a marked departure from her squeaky-clean roots as America\u2019s Nashville sweetheart.\n\n8. \u201cGorgeous\u201d: Yes, that\u2019s Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds\u2019s baby daughter James opening up \u201cGorgeous\u201d with a gurgle. But the rest of the song deals with adult topics. Over a bubbling, chime-like beat, Swift sings about the irresistible power of attraction \u2014 even when it\u2019s not the best idea. \u201cYou\u2019re so gorgeous, it actually hurts,\u201d she sings with frustration. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I hate more than what I can\u2019t have.\u201d Despondent, she talks of heading home to hang out with her cats \u2014 and then, with a wink, invites her object of attention to join her.\n\n9. \u201cGetaway Car\u201d: Told as a dramatic story of a heist and an ill-fated love adventure over shimmering 80s-style production, \u201cGetaway Car\u201d is one of Swift\u2019s most metaphor-driven tracks on the album. \u201cWe never had a shotgun shot in the dark,\u201d she sings with a rebellious twang. \u201cNothing good starts in a getaway car.\u201d Swift\u2019s has often had its fair share of melodrama; remember \u201cInto the Woods\u201d? In \u201cGetaway Car,\u201d though, she calls herself a \u201ctraitor\u201d who turns in her erstwhile partner in crime. Looks like Swift might be willing to flirt with the dark side, but she\u2019s no good at following through with crimes \u2014 of the legal kind, or of the heart. Instead, she says, she takes the keys and leaves the guy stranded at a motel. It\u2019s no happy ending, but it\u2019s a reminder that Swift isn\u2019t afraid to assert her independence.\n\n10. \u201cKing of My Heart\u201d: Taylor Swift has always been good at love songs. In \u201cKing of My Heart\u201d she hits her sweet spot, over a synth-heavy track and strategic auto-tune assist. \u201cI\u2019m perfectly fine, I live on my own, I made up my mind I\u2019m better off bein\u2019 alone,\u201d she starts off. But it doesn\u2019t stay that way for long; after meeting a (evidently non-American) paramour who pursues her, the story (and the song) go straight into the romance. \u201cYou\u2019re the one I have been waiting for,\u201d she gushes, dissing some other guys with \u201ctheir fancy cars\u201d who didn\u2019t quite measure up to this new interest. And yes, the character in the title is indeed the king of her heart \u2014 and body, and soul.\n\n11. \u201cDancing With Our Hands Tied\u201d: Although it starts off as a down-tempo, melancholy kind of tune, \u201cDancing With Our Hands Tied\u201d adds in Swift\u2019s now-rote trap-lite drop to amp up the drama on this will-we-won\u2019t-we tale of star-crossed lovers separated by an unkind fate. \u201cI had a bad feeling,\u201d she suggests about the romantic interest, but she goes on to dance with him anyway; some chemistry just can\u2019t be denied.\n\n12. \u201cDress\u201d: \u201cI only bought this dress so you could take it off,\u201d Swift sings slyly on \u201cDress,\u201d her most overtly sexual work yet. She wants her lover to carve his name into her bedpost; her hands shake in anticipation. A breathy, synth-y track with lots of whispery vocals, Swift is unequivocal about her interest in this person as much more than a friend. \u201cMade your mark on me; a golden tattoo,\u201d she sings cryptically. It\u2019s a departure from her usually PG approach to love songs, emblematic of a Swift who\u2019s claiming her maturity more than ever.\n\n13. \u201cThis Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things\u201d: Kicking things off with a siren sound, Swift strips it back to a stomping call-out of the haters, a giddy sister of sorts to dark lead single \u201cLook What You Made Me Do.\u201d \u201cWhy\u2019d you have to rain on my parade?\u201d she asks, her voice petulant, sneering with humor and attitude. \u201cThis is why we can\u2019t have nice things, darling: because you break them, I have to take them away.\u201d When she tries to go diplomatic \u2014 \u201cforgiveness is a nice thing to do\u201d goes one line, sung in an angelic lilt \u2014 she breaks the fourth wall with a burst of sharp laughter. Swift is no longer willing to \u201cShake It Off,\u201d as she once tried to do.\n\n14. \u201cCall It What You Want\u201d: Maybe the most by-the-book Swift song on Reputation, \u201cCall It What You Want\u201d is a slow-burning meditation on the transformative power of relationships, filled with lyrical puns: \u201cAll the liars are calling me one,\u201d she sighs at one point. \u201cAll my flowers grew back as thorns.\u201d But this is still a love letter, and a reminder that Swift has moved on from the fray around her so-called \u201creputation.\u201d \u201cMy baby\u2019s fly like a jetstream, high above the whole scene,\u201d she sings proudly, making it clear that the baby in question has taken her along for the ride.\n\n15. \u201cNew Year\u2019s Day\u201d: Her one acoustic piano ballad on the album, \u201cNew Year\u2019s Day\u201d is a tender and intimate love song. The snapshots are sweet and evocative: glitter on the floor after a party, candle wax and polaroids on the hardwood floor, holding hands in the backseat of a taxi. \u201cHold on to the memories,\u201d she repeats in the chorus, \u201cand I will hold on to you.\u201d Nostalgic for the moment even as it\u2019s happening, it\u2019s a lovely, effecting closer, letting Swift\u2019s voice and earnest message shine without the complications of over-production. She may get her kicks with big pop anthems, but vulnerable ballads like this one are just as much a part of her musical DNA."}

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2012\n\nThanks to the magic of social media and his own obsession with press coverage, the American people have access to a rich archive of our president\u2019s unseemly fixations. Trump\u2019s brief obsession with Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart ranks alongside his diatribe about his predecessor\u2019s gum-chewing habit as the strangest of these. What drove him to tweet seven times about the breakup of America\u2019s sweethearts? Why did he seem so desperate for Pattinson\u2019s friendship? And what did the subjects of his sweaty speculation think of all this?\n\nUntil now, like the great philosophical inquiries, all of these questions were virtually unanswerable. Today, those of us who care about these things got some long-awaited insight into one of them, at least. That\u2019s because a noble reporter at Entertainment Weekly had the good sense to ask Pattinson about it. Unfortunately, Pattinson\u2019s answer wasn\u2019t particularly revealing:\n\nDoes it seem somewhat surreal that the current president of the United States once wrote a bunch of tweets about you?\n\n[Laughs] I think there\u2019s so many different levels of it.

But I guess now I\u2019m sort of thinking, like, \u201cWell, I guess that is related to me.\u201d But how does that fit in with all the other things going on in my life? And sometimes you think, \u201cCan I use this in my acting? Or should I be putting it away.\u201d It\u2019s kind of interesting, I guess. I don\u2019t know \u2014 this could be why people get annoyed with me.\n\nNow all we need to do is pick the brain of MEAT BALL\u2019S GHOST, the guy who used the RPatz/KStew tweets to predict Trump\u2019s presidency."}

{"label": false, "txt": "After Angelina Jolie claimed in court documents that her estranged husband, Brad Pitt, hadn't paid \"meaningful\" formal child support since their split about two years ago, the actor's attorneys fired back in a new filing of their own Wednesday, asserting that Pitt has contributed more than $1.3 million in bills for Jolie and their six children and loaned the actress $8 million to help her buy her current home.\n\nIn the court documents, obtained by \"Good Morning America,\" Pitt's lawyers also contend that at a hearing last week, Jolie's attorney did not mention any child support issues and claim that asking to schedule a new hearing on the subject is \"calculated to increase conflict.\"\n\nPitt's lawyers also slammed Jolie's filing as a \"thinly-veiled effort to manipulate media coverage.\"\n\nJolie's spokeswoman, Mindy Nyby, addressed those claims on Tuesday.\n\n\"The aim of Angelina\u2019s routine court filing is to provide closure to the marriage in a way that clears a path toward the next stage of their lives and allows her and Brad to recommit as devoted co-parents to their children,\" Nyby said.\n\nJolie's attorneys also released a statement explaining her filing.\n\n\"Angelina\u2019s filing of yesterday was both legally appropriate and factually accurate in all respects. What has been filed by Brad\u2019s side today is a blatant attempt to obfuscate the truth and distract from the fact that he has not fully met his legal obligations to support the children. Following the incident of September 2016, Angelina and the children needed to move from the family home, which Brad chose to keep, including all of its contents. Brad was asked to assist in the expense of a new home for Angelina and the children, but instead he loaned Angelina money, for which he is charging her interest on a payment plan. Angelina will of course honor that loan. A loan is not, however, child support and to represent it as such is misleading and inaccurate.\n\n\"Angelina is asking Brad to pay 50% of the children\u2019s expenses. He has not. Angelina has had to shoulder the majority of those without his contribution for the past two years. Child support is not optional in California. Typically a father of means would pay these expenses voluntarily without the need for a request or court order. We are hopeful that this can be resolved without further delay or posturing,\" the statement read.\n\n\u201c \u201d It\u2019s deplorable that someone for their own selfish reasons leaked selective portions of the confidential and sealed court record...\n\nJolie, 43, filed for divorce from Pitt, 53, in 2016, after two years of marriage and more than a decade as a couple. The actress has primary custody of the their six children: Maddox, 17; Pax, 14; Zahara, 13; Shiloh, 12, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 10.\n\nYet in June, a judge in the divorce case made several stipulations to ensure that Pitt maintains a close relationship with them. Those demands include a new visitation schedule for the summer and for Jolie to arrange a phone call between their kids and the children's doctors in which it would be explained that \"the court has determined each of them are safe with their father.\"\n\nThe actress and her team were furious about the release of those documents, which were obtained by The Blast and reviewed by ABC News, calling them \"misleading\" and \"not in the best interest of the children.\"\n\nIn a statement released at the time, Jolie's team insisted that the family court negotiations remain private.\n\n\"From the start, Angelina has been focused on their health and needs, which is why it was so important that this last court hearing be conducted privately.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s deplorable that someone for their own selfish reasons leaked selective portions of the confidential and sealed court record to create an inaccurate and unfair picture of what is really happening.\""}

Time does not comment on our choice until publication.\"\n\nSecuring the magazine's title \u2014 which was launched in 1927 \u2014 has long been a preoccupation of Mr Trump's.\n\nIn June the magazine asked Mr Trump to take down framed copies of a fake March 2009 Time cover featuring Mr Trump that had been prominently displayed in at least five of the President's golf clubs.\n\nThe photoshopped image featured Mr Trump alongside a headline claiming his Apprentice reality TV series was a \"television smash\".\n\nThe cover also said: \"Trump is hitting on all fronts \u2026 even TV.\"\n\nThe counterfeit cover also had several other \"telling mistakes\", including a skinnier red border, no white border and an issue with the placement of the secondary headlines.\n\nAs his campaign for the presidency picked up steam in late 2015, the then New York businessman was hopeful of being featured on the cover as Person of the Year.\n\nHe even sat for a photo shoot with a bald eagle.\n\nIt wasn't to be, though, with the billionaire missing out to German Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nMr Trump was less than impressed.\n\nIn the following months the magazine was critical of his presidential campaign, featuring caricatures of him on the front describing his bid as being in \"meltdown\".\n\nDespite their criticism, he was finally named Person of the Year in 2016, a month after securing the presidency.\n\nHe said it was a \"great honour\" which \"meant a lot\". But that didn't stop him again going on the attack a few days later.\n\n\"I was lucky enough to receive the Time Person of the Year,\" Mr Trump told a crowd in Des Moines, Iowa, on his Thank You victory tour.\n\n\"They used to call it 'Man of the Year,' but they can't do that anymore, so they call it 'person'. They want to be politically correct. That's OK.\"\n\nThere were also suggestions on social media that the cover featuring Mr Trump was designed in a way that made it seem he had \"devil horns\" with the placement of the letter \"M\" in the magazine's name directly behind his head.\n\nTime magazine denied this and posted a gallery on their website of past covers that also appeared to give their subjects horns.\n\nAfter a year of headlines, the naming of Mr Trump as Person of the Year for a second time, as he has claimed, may not come as a surprise to many.\n\nBut former Time editor Richard Stengel was sceptical and tweeted that the photo and interview request does not mean Mr Trump was likely to take out the title for the second year in a row.\n\nEither way, Mr Trump's claim that he was \"PROBABLY\" going to take out the title when it's announced on December 6 has predictably been a source of mirth on social media.\n\nTopics: donald-trump, print-media, social-media, offbeat, human-interest, information-and-communication, united-states\n\nFirst posted"}

In 2017, Time magazine named her as one of the 100 most influential people in the world and Forbes featured her in their 30 Under 30 list.[4][5]\n\nBorn and raised on a farm in Dalby, Queensland, Robbie studied drama at Somerset College. She began her career in Australian independent films in the late 2000s, before working in the soap opera Neighbours (2008\u20132011), which earned her two Logie Award nominations. After moving to the United States, she starred in the short-lived ABC drama series Pan Am (2011\u20132012). In 2013, she had a supporting role in the romantic comedy About Time, and made her breakthrough later that year by co-starring in Martin Scorsese's biographical black comedy The Wolf of Wall Street.\n\nRobbie launched a production company named LuckyChap Entertainment in 2014. Her profile continued to grow with leading roles in the romantic drama Focus (2015), as Jane Porter Clayton in the action-adventure film The Legend of Tarzan (2016), and as Harleen Quinzel / Harley Quinn in the superhero film Suicide Squad (2016). Robbie received critical acclaim in 2017 for her portrayal of the disgraced figure skater Tonya Harding in the biographical film I, Tonya, which she also produced, receiving a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress.\n\nEarly life\n\nMargot Elise Robbie was born in Dalby, Queensland, and grew up in the Gold Coast hinterland.[6] Her parents are Sarie Kessler, a physiotherapist, and Doug Robbie, a former farm owner.[7][2][8] She has three siblings: an elder brother, Lachlan or \"Lachie\"; a younger brother, Cameron; and a sister, Anya.[8][9][10] Robbie grew up on a farm,[11] where she and her siblings were raised by their single mother; she has minimal contact with her father.[7][12] To make ends meet, Robbie worked three jobs simultaneously at the age of 16.[7] She studied drama at school,[7] graduating at Somerset College.[13] At the age of 17, Robbie moved to Melbourne to begin acting professionally.[14][15]\n\nCareer\n\n2007\u20132011: Career beginnings and Neighbours\n\nRobbie has been acting professionally since 2007, when she starred in two feature films, I.C.U. and Vigilante.

Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote \"Robbie is a wow and then some. The Aussie actress who made us sit up and take notice as Leonardo DiCaprio's wife in The Wolf of Wall Street shows a comic flair backed up with beauty and steel. Even when Focus fumbles, Robbie deals a winning hand.\"[41] Focus grossed over $150 million worldwide.[42][43] In 2015, Robbie received a nomination for the BAFTA Rising Star Award.[44] Also in 2015, Robbie played the leading role of Ann Burden in the film adaptation of Z for Zachariah with Chris Pine and Chiwetel Ejiofor, which was shot in New Zealand.[45][46] The film premiered on 24 January 2015 at the Sundance Film Festival [47] and had its theatrical release on 28 August 2015, receiving positive reviews.[48][49] Robbie's performance was praised by critics.

Lest some of you have forgotten, Pippa famously stole the thunder at Kate Middleton\u2018s wedding by wearing *that* dress, the one that all the tabloids and publications were talking about for weeks on end after the wedding was over. In fact, major publications spent more time covering Pippa\u2019s dress than Kate\u2019s actual wedding, a fact that did not go unnoticed by the royals or Kate.\n\nSince then, Pippa\u2019s been taking a much more low-key role in her relationship with the media and publicity, with exceptions every now and then. But because of her history at thunder-stealing, she understands how easy it is for attention at weddings to drift to someone other than the bride \u2013 and in this particular circumstance, it\u2019s almost a given that it will happen to her.\n\nAccording to recent reports, Pippa Middleton is worried that inviting Meghan Markle, Prince Harry\u2019s beau, to her wedding will shift the attention away from her wedding and onto Meghan. As we saw a few days ago, Meghan Markle attended Prince Harry\u2019s friend\u2019s wedding in Jamaica, and all anyone in the media cared about the next few days was Meghan. And unfortunately, Pippa Middleton is clearly a lot more attention-hungry than Harry\u2019s friends (who are reportedly generally down-to-earth), which means that she\u2019s much less likely to want Meghan at her wedding.\n\nSources tell the Daily Mail that Pippa definitely noticed how events played out at the wedding in the Caribbean, explaining, \u201cShe saw how all eyes were on Meghan rather than Lara (the bride) last week. The situation was also stressful for Harry. Pippa and her mother Carole wonder whether Meghan\u2019s presence could cause a great deal of unnecessary chaos.\u201d\n\nAccording to the same source, Pippa is now employing a \u201cno ring, no guest\u201d policy which will ensure that the only people who attend her wedding will be guests and their married spouses \u2013 which would essentially eliminate Meghan. However, being that it\u2019s Prince Harry we\u2019re talking about, you think he wouldn\u2019t make his own rules on who he could bring? Can you imagine him NOT bringing Meghan Markle to his own sister-in-law\u2019s wedding, given that he took her to a friend\u2019s wedding?\n\nWhat do you guys think?

{"label": false, "txt": "Chris Martin breaks down his Coldplay pay structure, while Gwyneth Paltrow has plenty of dough thanks to her \"Iron Man\" paycheck. Charley Gallay/Getty Gwyneth Paltrow, 41, and Chris Martin, 37, announced their split Tuesday on her website, Goop, in a civilized blog post titled \"Conscious Uncoupling.\"\n\nThe couple have two children.\n\nAfter 10 years, the Oscar-winning actress and Coldplay frontman have amassed quite an empire \u2014 but what exactly is at stake if the two proceed with the divorce?\n\nE! Online estimates that Paltrow and Martin are worth $140 million each, making their combined fortune a whopping $280 million. But reports of their wealth vary widely, with Britain's Sunday Times pegging their combined net worth at nearly $120 million in 2012.\n\nIn 2013, Paltrow and Martin both appeared on Forbes magazine's list of the 100 highest-earning celebrities. Paltrow landed at No. 71 with $10 million and Coldplay came in at No. 14 with $64 million.\n\nSo where's all the dough coming from? Let's break it down.\n\nChris Martin:\n\nChris Martin, who makes most of his money off concert tours, just joined NBC's \"The Voice.\" Facebook/The Voice \"Chris Martin is clearly the bigger earner in the relationship,\" Dorothy Pomerantz, L.A. bureau chief for Forbes, told E! News. \"With musicians like Coldplay it depends on touring, which is where they make the big money. So every year these guys go out on tour, they will sell out giant arenas and will make tons of money. It doesn't really come from the album sales. It comes from the touring.\"\n\nIndeed, Martin has admitted that Coldplay owns only a piece of its publishing rights, while the band's Universal Music label owns its catalogue.\n\nMartin discussed the matter with Howard Stern in a 2011 interview. \"No, we don't own hardly any of it \u2026 You'll have to talk to my manager, but we don't own it for at least 20 years or something.\n\n\"We own quite a lot of the publishing but we don't own much of the recording,\" he said. \"That's why people always think bands are a lot richer than they are because they never remember that bit.\"\n\nMartin doesn't have to worry, though. He told Stern that the four members split their earnings \"20-20-20-40,\" with the largest share going to him as the lead singer-songwriter.\n\nThat breakdown fares well for Martin, whose band sold more than 60 million albums worldwide and whose last 2012 \"Mylo Xyloto\" concert tour grossed more than $170 million, according to The New York Times.\n\nGwyneth Paltrow:\n\nThanks to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop website, best-selling cookbooks, and endorsement deals, the actress has turned into a lucrative lifestyle brand. Kevin Winter/Getty According to Bloomberg Businessweek, Paltrow's films have grossed more than $3.9 billion worldwide. \"Iron Man\" accounts for $1.2 billion of that.\n\n\"When you are in a movie like 'Iron Man,' even if you are not the star and it makes so much money you get some of that back end,\" says Forbes' Dorothy Pomerantz. \"She is not getting Robert Downey Jr. money but she gets a taste of it. She gets money from Goop, from her cookbooks, and from her TV work ... She has money coming from several different sources now, because she really is a brand and when you put it all together, it is around $10 million.\"\n\nIn addition to Paltrow's 150,000 Goop subscribers and her newest cookbook, 2013's \"It's All Good,\" debuting at No. 1 on The New York Times best-seller list, the 41-year-old has lucrative endorsement deals.\n\nPeople magazine reported that Paltrow's portfolio includes Max Factor's Modern Icon campaign ($4.9 million), Boss perfume ($1.9 million), and Est\u00e9e Lauder ($8.2 million).\n\nIn 2008, the year she became a face of Est\u00e9e Lauder and the first \"Iron Man\"came out, Forbes estimated she made $25 million.\n\nReal Estate:\n\nThe couple's kitchen in their Los Angeles home. Veranda Unveils The couple's real-estate portfolio has five properties around the world \u2014 a \"home they bought in 2012 in L.A.'s Brentwood neighborhood, a Manhattan apartment, a Hamptons estate and a mansion in London's upscale Belsize Park neighborhood, which they bought from Kate Winslet in 2004. Additionally, they purchased the property next door and combined the two into a single large estate,\" according to People.\n\nEarlier this month, the Los Angeles Times said the couple paid $14 million for a Malibu home, which will now reportedly be used as Martin's \"bachelor pad.\"\n\nThe couple likely have a prenuptial agreement, but if not, California \u2014 the state in which they were married \u2014 is a community property state, meaning marital property is divided in half in the event of a divorce."}

{"label": false, "txt": "Now, it\u2019s official: Star Wars fans will have one final chance to say goodbye to Carrie Fisher, with Lucasfilm announcing that the actress, who died in December 2016, will appear in next year\u2019s Star Wars: Episode IX.\n\nIn a statement, director J.J. Abrams sought to put concerns about potential CGI resurrections to rest, saying that the new movie will use \u201cunseen footage we shot together in Episode VII\u201d and assuring fans that \u201cwe were never going to recast, or use a CG character.\u201d While this is, undoubtedly, comforting, it would also appear to offer particular clues about the role Fisher \u2014 or, more specifically, her character, Leia Organa \u2014 will play in the movie.\n\nFirstly: Purely for practical purposes, Leia\u2019s presence in the movie will be small. If nothing else, there can\u2019t be that much extraneous, unseen footage from 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens; she was barely in that movie, so unless large swaths of scenes were shot but never even hinted at by anyone involved in the production, there\u2019s limited material to draw from in the first place, and surely not everything available will be used.\n\nConsidering the context of the footage, it also limits the potential use for Episode IX. Leia appeared in few scenes and locations in The Force Awakens. Leia was on Takodana, rescuing Han, Chewbacca, Rey and Finn, and then at the Resistance base on D\u2019Qar, where she takes part in planning, and later monitoring, the attack on Starkiller Base. Aside from brief interludes with Han and, later, Rey, she\u2019s very much in \u201charried leader\u201d mode throughout the movie. Does this mean that this is the Leia we\u2019ll see in Episode IX, even after losing her ex-husband, and then her brother, in the previous two movies?\n\n(It\u2019s possible that the Fisher footage will end up being just a minor flashback, used to punctuate a contemporary moment; memories during her funeral, as some on social media have already suggested. If so, then the above problem is side-stepped, to a degree.)\n\nAbrams\u2019 comments leave space for some level of postproduction trickery to be applied to the Fisher footage. Presumably, Fisher will be intercut with new footage of actors shot specifically for Episode IX. Will digital trickery be used to make sure that Fisher shares a location with the other cast members? If so, will that be all that\u2019s altered? What about costuming choices? For that matter, what about the potential for posthumous dubbing or soundalikes used for dialogue where Leia is off-camera or not in close-up? Abrams said that the movie would never use a CG character, but what about a performance augmented or altered by CG?\n\nOf course, if any such edits or alterations are made, they\u2019ll have to be done with subtlety and sensitivity. This is key to the entire enterprise of including footage of Fisher posthumously. For as much as fans want to be able to say goodbye to the actress, and also to Leia, they want to do so in a manner that feels appropriate and respectful to both. While Abrams and Lucasfilm \u2014 and Fisher\u2019s family, especially daughter Billie Lourd, named in Abrams\u2019 statement \u2014 want to provide both closure and tribute to Leia and Fisher alike with this move, they\u2019re courting backlash if this isn\u2019t done perfectly.\n\nThat the footage will come from The Force Awakens feels particularly fitting, then; that, after all, was a project that already came with expectations and looming accusations from fandom expecting the worst. It\u2019s also perhaps a reminder that those involved with this move love the mythology \u2014 and loved Fisher as a person \u2014 as much as anyone else, if not more so, and will be approaching it with the utmost care.\n\nEveryone will, inevitably, remain worried until the final product appears onscreen, but perhaps we can rest just slightly in the meantime."}

She told me that she had fallen in love with the director of the film.\n\nI was so shocked I said, \u2018I'm out of here.\u2019\u201d\n\n11 Christina Applegate Dumps Brad At The MTV Awards\n\nVia popsugar.com\n\nBrad had a pretty busy year in 1989, including his first bona fide Hollywood movie roles, and, as rumor would have it, a string of girlfriends, and even a three month engagement. That\u2019s packing a lot into one year. Christina Applegate, though, was riding high on the popularity of Married...With Children, which was in its third season. The two apparently dated, but maybe it was Christina\u2019s rising star that got between them. Who knows? What the world does know, is that Christina was Brad\u2019s date to the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards \u2013 and she ditched him by the end of the night. Singer Sebastian Bach has claimed in interviews that it was he who left the show that night with Christina. She\u2019s never confirmed that version of events. On the show Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in August 15, though, Christina finally admitted to the incident, although she said it was a non-celeb. The move ended their relationship, not surprisingly.\n\n10 E.G. Daily Comes To Brad\u2019s Defence\n\nVia trend-chaser.com\n\nadvertising\n\nElizabeth Ann Guttman a.k.a. E.G. Daily has played in a number of movies since her debut on the silver screen in 1978. She's perhaps best known for playing Dottie in Pee-wee's Big Adventure, and voicing characters like Buttercup in The Powerpuff Girls. In 1989, she apparently became one of the many, many women that Brad dated that year. At the time, Brad never talked about any of the rumors, but in an interview with The Daily Mail in September 2016, she came to his defence. A\n\nt the time, he'd just split with wife Angelina Jolie, and E.G. made a point of going on the record to say what a \"gentle guy\" he was.\n\nFrom my experience with him, he was a very down-to-Earth man, she said. E.G. says the two remained close for years after their split.\n\n9 Brad Had A Thing With Geena Davis\n\nVia trend-chaser.com\n\nBrad\u2019s real breakout role came in the 1991 buddy movie Thelma & Louise. In it, he plays the swaggering hustler who sweet talks his way into Geena Davis\u2019 bed and then robs her while she sleeps. But, before she wakes up, the two of them light up the screen with one of movie history\u2019s most talked about intimate scenes. In the movie, the relationship was a one-night stand, but there were rumors at the time that Geena and Brad enjoyed each other\u2019s company off screen as well. Neither actor has confirmed those rumors, even years later. But, in 2014, actor Jason Priestley came out with his memoir. It turns out that Priestley and Pitt were roommates back in the day when both were struggling. He says that Brad and Geena, who had just split from hubby Jeff Goldblum, had a relationship that lasted at least as long as the movie shoot.\n\nadvertising\n\n8 Brad Romances British Beauty Thandie Newton\n\nVia trend-chaser.com\n\nadvertising\n\nBrad co-starred in the 1994 hit Interview With A Vampire with Tom Cruise. It was a meaty role in a popular movie, but ever since then, Brad hasn't had much good to say about it in interviews. In 2011, he told Entertainment Weekly that he looked miserable in the movie for a very good reason. \u201cI am miserable.\u201d He told the interviewer that the only bright spot of the shoot was the city is was filmed in. \u201cThe great thing that came out of that movie is that it birthed my love affair with New Orleans.\u201d But, if the rumors are true, there was one other aspect of working on the set that found his favor \u2013 British actress Thandie Newton. Thandie played the role of Yvette, who was a servant to Brad\u2019s character Louis. In fact, there\u2019s a scene where he kills her in the movie. Off set, though, we\u2019re told that the two had a relationship that lasted pretty much as long as the shoot.\n\n7 A Model Household With Jitka Pohlodek\n\nVia trend-chaser.com\n\nBrad had a relationship with actress Juliette Lewis that lasted about four years, and began when Juliette was only 16. But, it seems like Pitt doesn't like to be single for very long \u2013 in fact, you could call him a chronic serial monogamist. He split with Juliette about February 1993, and it wasn't long before he was photographed with stunning Czech model Jitka Pohlodek. At the time, Brad owned a mansion in the Hollywood Hills that was almost a century old, and Jitka was known to have spent a lot of her time there for about a year. Their household included Jitka's two pet bobcats, Brad's three dogs, and a bunch of chameleons and iguanas. While it sounds like domestic bliss, when Vanity Fair interviewed him in November 1994, while he was still dating Jitka, he told the reporter that he was still in love with Juliette.\n\n\u201cI still love the woman.\n\nThe problem is, we grow up with this vision that love conquers all, and that\u2019s just not so, is it?\u201d\n\n6 Claire Forlani Causes A Media Furor\n\nVia trend-chaser.com\n\nadvertising\n\nBrad and Gwyneth Paltrow had a much publicized relationship that lasted from 1994 to 1997, and we'll just point out that the two met on the set of the movie Se7en. After the two split up, Brad began filming Meet Joe Black, co-starring Anthony Hopkins and British actress Claire Forlani. We'll point out that Ms. Forlani also has a history of dating co-stars, including Ben Stiller and John Cusack. Brad and Claire were often photographed together, and they attended the 50th Annual WGA Awards together as dates. The tabloids went crazy with the theory that Claire had actually broken up Brad's engagement with Gwyneth, and she went from actress with a budding career to tabloid fodder overnight. We'll never know what really happened, but if a relationship did blossom, we're betting the media scrutiny is what put it to a quick end.\n\n5 Did Brad have a secret relationship With April Florio?\n\nVia trend-chaser.com\n\nIn 2005, foxy model April Florio had an interview with Us Weekly. She told the reporter about a relationship she'd had with Brad Pitt in 2003. According to the Us Weekly story, April said that she's met Brad after being introduced by pal George Clooney. According to her story, Brad \"was attracted to me,\" and complained that he was bored with his marriage to Jen.\n\n\"He hated the fact that his wife liked to hang with her friends or just stay home. He liked to go to parties more.\"\n\nAt the time ,April was 22 and Brad 41. She said \u2013 and her agent confirmed \u2013 that she had spent three days in Greece with Brad, and that he'd bought her a plane ticket to Los Angeles. When the story hit the media, however, April tried to back out completely, claiming that she'd only bumped into him at a party, and that the reporter had misrepresented her words. Brad, as per usual, denied it all. But, the reporter said the whole thing was on tape.\n\n4 Demi Moore Rumors \u2013 Then And Now\n\nVia thestandard.co.uk\n\nadvertising\n\nIn 1998, Demi Moore was going through a very public and pretty nasty divorce with Bruce Willis. During that time, the rumors flew that she and Brad Pitt were hooking up. The fling was said to be hot, but over pretty quickly. In March 2018, the rumors about Demi and Brad flew again. According to a report in RadarOnline, Brad, still despondent about his divorce from Angelina, had reached out to Demi in desperation. Demi was said to be drawing him into Kabbalah, the esoteric philosophy inspired by Judaism that Demi, Madonna and other celebs subscribe to. Another story in the National Enquirer said the two were practicing \"sensual yoga\" together. But, according to GossipCop and E!Online, the recent rumors aren't true. Now about 1998? We'll never know for sure.\n\n3 Julia Ormond And A Legendary Rumor\n\n\u201cI think Brad has something very special. Apart from the fact that he\u2019s a gorgeous guy, he\u2019s also someone who\u2019s constantly trying to shrug that off.\n\nHe\u2019s not egotistical. He\u2019s very, very careful with people, and sweet.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what Julia Ormond told a reporter in 1995 about her Legends of the Fall co-star. The movie had just come out, and Julia had nothing but good things to say about Brad. Rumors flew around the set and in the media that Julia and Brad were practicing their love scenes in the movie for real. Julia was married at the time, although she divorced her husband in 1994, and neither has ever confirmed the rumors.\n\n2 Sonita Henry, Another Rumored Fling\n\nVia pinterest.com/wikipedia.org\n\nadvertising\n\nBrad's alleged relationship with British actress Sonita Henry is reported to have happened in 1998. If it happened, it would have been more of a hook-up than a relationship. There were many rumors about Brad and Sonita, who was just beginning her acting career at the time. Neither has confirmed the rumors or even discussed them. If it's true, then it would have happened during Brad's post-Gwen and pre-Jen dating period, and it would make sense \u2013 although we\u2019re curious how these two might have met. Sonita's never gotten to the A-list, unlike Brad, but she's carved out a name for herself in the sci-fi world with roles in Star Trek, Doctor Who, and others.\n\n1 Brad Knocks Out Mike Tyson\u2019s Chances With His Ex\n\nVia trend-chaser.com\n\nWhen Brad Pitt worked opposite actress Robin Givens on the set of sitcom Head of the Class in January 1989, she was technically still married to boxer Mike Tyson. In 2012, Tyson went on Conan to try out some material for his one-man show, and one of the anecdotes was about Robin and Brad. Tyson says that he dropped by Robin\u2019s place one morning in February 1989, hoping for a quick booty call on his way to the divorce lawyer. But, when he saw Brad in her kitchen, he knew the chances of any carnal relations with his soon to be ex were dashed. It became a favorite story that Mike would bring up in many interviews. In 2016, he told The Real, \u201cI didn't really catch them in the act \u2014 maybe before the act. He's a really nice guy.\u201d\n\nReferences: trendchaser.com, popsugar.com, people.com, eonline.com, femalefirst.co.uk, people.com, nola.com, ew.com\n\nadvertising\n\nGive TheRichest a Thumbs up!"}

{"label": false, "txt": "Taylor Swift is the queen of breakup songs. And songwriting in general, but especially breakup songs. Narrowing them down to the top 15 was difficult, but I think I've got them chosen from the least to the most heartbreaking.\n\n1. Forever And Always\n\nI feel this deserved to be mentioned since it's one of her most well known songs. Who could ever forget the song she wrong about Joe Jonas breaking up with her on the phone?\n\nMy favorite line: \"So here's to everything, coming down to nothing. Here's to silence that cuts me to the core.\"\n\n2. Haunted\n\nThis song is haunting, as the title suggests. The music in the background, her lyrics all add up to a breathtaking song.\n\nMy favorite line: \"He will try to take away my pain, and he just might make me smile but the whole time I'm wishing he was you instead.\"\n\n3. I Almost Do\n\nThis song is one of her saddest, but not because it's so heartbreaking as it is reminiscent of a past relationship. I think what's so upsetting about this song is that it's about a relationship that could possibly work again, but she's too afraid to get hurt.\n\nMy favorite line: \"I confess, baby, that in my dreams you're touching my face and asking me if I wanna try again with you, and I almost do.\"\n\n4. Wildest Dreams\n\nThis song isn't about a breakup per se as it is about a relationship that is going to reach its inevitable end. It's haunting and beautiful nonetheless.\n\nMy favorite line: \"Someday when you leave me, I bet these memories follow you around.\"\n\n5. You're Not Sorry\n\nWhile I've always been a huge Taylor Swift fan, I first heard this song when she guest starred on CSI and I've loved it ever since.\n\nMy favorite line: \"Coulda loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold, and you've got your share of secrets and I'm tired of being last to know.\"\n\n6. Breathe\n\nThis is one of her more underrated songs, I think. This song was composed with Colbie Calliat and it's a masterpiece.\n\nMy favorite line: \"People are people and sometimes we change our mind, but it's killing me to see you go after all this time.\"\n\n7. Sad Beautiful Tragic\n\nAnother underrated song from her Red album. It's very sad, very somber, and very emotional.\n\nMy favorite line: \"Time is taking its sweet time erasing you.\"\n\n8. White Horse\n\nAnother Taylor Swift classic and one that's sure to hit you right in the feels. This one is sure to help anyone through a breakup, as it begins sad and heartbroken and ends with her realizing that she deserves to be treated better.\n\nMy favorite line: \"I'm not your princess, this ain't a fairy-tale, I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well.\"\n\n9. Come In With the Rain\n\nUnderrated and one of my favorite. This track appears on her Fearless Platinum Edition and if she ever performed this live I would certainly die. In this song, she's tired of fighting for a broken relationship and instead is waiting on the love interest to make his move.\n\n\n\nMy favorite line: \"I've got you down, I know you by heart, but you don't even know where I start.\"\n\n10. The Last Time\n\n\n\nTaylor performs this song on her Red tour with Gary Lightbody from the band Snow Patrol. This is a song anyone who has been in a back and forth relationship can understand. Taylor battles with letting in the guy who continues to hurt her and he battles with never staying yet desperately loving her.\n\nMy favorite line: \"You wear your best apology, but I was there to watch you leave.\"\n\n11. Cold As You\n\nThis will always be one of my favorites by Taylor. There aren't many words I can use to describe this song except the fact that, while I am not much of a crier, this one gets to me. Always.\n\nMy favorite song: \"You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray, and I stood there loving you and wished them all away. And you come away with a great little story of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you.\"\n\n12. If This Was A Movie\n\nThis comes from the deluxe edition of her Speak Now album. I find that many of her bonus track songs are some of her best and underrated, and this is no exception. This is a song where Taylor compares her love life and what would happen if life was indeed a movie, to the harsh reality of the life we are dealt and how relationships don't always work.\n\nMy favorite line: \"I know people change and these things happen but I remember how it was back then, wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughin', cause nothing like this ever happened to them.\"\n\n13. Dear John\n\nAh, the song Taylor so blatantly wrote about her ex John Mayer. This is a song where Taylor calls John out for the terrible way he treated her she recognizes that she maybe should have listened to everyone who told her he was a bad idea. But hindsight is 20/20 and when you're in love it's hard to see past how in love with them you are, even if they are bad for you.\n\nMy favorite song: \"Well maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame, or maybe it's you and your sick need to give love then take it away,\" or \"You are an expert at 'sorry' and keeping lines blurry, never impressed by me acing your tests.\"\n\n14. Last Kiss\n\nIf you've heard this song, it needs no explanation. And if you haven't heard this song, go listen to it. Now.\n\nMy favorite line: \"I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day and something reminds you you wish you had stayed. You can plan for a change in the weather and time, but I never planned on you changing your mind.\"\n\n15. All Too Well\n\nMy favorite Taylor Swift song ever happens to be her saddest, in my opinion. This song paints a vivid picture of the wonderful beginning of a relationship all the way to the bitter end, when you're left alone with the memories and the heartbreak.\n\nMy favorite line: \"Maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much, but maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up,\" or \"You call me up again just to break me like a promise, so casually cruel in the name of being honest.\""}

{"label": false, "txt": "Johnny Depp\u2019s bad boy persona used to help sell the movies he made. He was a real life Capt. Jack Sparrow, who could hit the press circuit armed with a few rococo anecdotes, delivered with a rock \u2018n roll edge in between drags of freshly rolled cigarettes. His act was charming and his mystique undeniable.\n\nNo longer. A new Rolling Stone profile of the actor compares Depp\u2019s current, debauched existence to Elvis\u2019s last, drug-fueled days. It left readers and people in Hollywood alarmed with its portrayal of Depp, a 55-year-old man, drinking goblet after goblet of vintage red wine, smoking hash, and, it is heavily implied, partaking in even stronger substances, all while cordoned off in a gated mansion that leaves him cut off from reality.\n\nStudios still in business with the actor were poring over the profile this morning, assessing what \u2014 if any \u2014 fallout there would be from the piece. At a minimum, it\u2019s a major distraction for the backers of Depp\u2019s upcoming films \u2014 a list that includes Global Road\u2019s September crime drama \u201cCity of Lies\u201d and Warner Bros. big-budget \u201cFantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald.\u201d Spokespeople for both studios declined to comment, and a spokesperson for Depp did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe truth is that even before the Rolling Stone article hit stands, Depp has been widely viewed as a liability. He is out of step with the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up movements after being accused by ex-wife Amber Heard of domestic assault. The backlash to those allegations has been so intense that J.K. Rowling felt moved to defend casting the actor in \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d nearly a year before the film even hit theaters.\n\n\u201cBased on our understanding of the circumstances, the filmmakers and I are not only comfortable sticking with our original casting but genuinely happy to have Johnny playing a major character in the movies,\u201d Rowling said in a statement.\n\nAnd his legal battle with his former business managers has laid bare embarrassing spending details and, worse yet, exposed him as an actor in desperate need of paycheck roles to fund a lifestyle he can no longer afford. Studios want Depp to share a few choice on-set memories, not expose him to a grilling about his stormy personal life.\n\n\u201cHis baggage is a huge concern,\u201d said Jeff Bock, a box office analyst with Exhibitor Relations. \u201cPart of the reason to hire an A-list actor is so they can hit the talk- show circuit and travel around the world promoting a film. That might not be possible now.\u201d\n\nIt also means that Depp\u2019s co-stars will now have to deflect questions about the actor\u2019s behavior when they go out to talk up the films.\n\nThe Rolling Stone story may have set off alarms, but an individual with knowledge of the \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d production said the portrait it presented of a zonked- out movie star was not in keeping with Depp\u2019s on-set behavior. He was on time, knew his lines, and was courteous to cast and crew.\n\nIt is also true that unlike indefatigable promoters such as Tom Cruise and Will Smith, Depp tends to be more sparing in his press appearances. He will traditionally only do a few magazine profiles, often with favored outlets such as Vanity Fair, and a handful of on-camera interviews.\n\nDepp isn\u2019t the only actor whose off-screen behavior is causing headaches for studios these days. Vertical Entertainment is moving ahead with the August release of \u201cBillionaire Boys Club,\u201d despite the presence of Kevin Spacey, an actor accused of harassing and assaulting several men, some of whom were underage.\n\nAmazon still has to figure out what to do with \u201cA Rainy Day in New York,\u201d an upcoming Woody Allen movie. The director has become toxic as allegations that he assaulted his daughter, Dylan Farrow, have received more media coverage since Hollywood has been battling an industry-wide sexual harassment crisis. Several of the films stars, a group that includes Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Rebecca Hall, have donated their salaries to charity and expressed regret for working on the film. Amazon has yet to announce a release date for the picture, which doesn\u2019t seem like a show of confidence.\n\nAnd earlier this week, Peter Fonda attracted a wave of bad publicity after tweeting that Barron Trump should be ripped from his mother\u2019s arms while calling out the Trump administration\u2019s family separation policy. Sony Pictures Classics, the distributor of Fonda\u2019s next film \u201cBoundaries,\u201d said it had no plans to delay or cancel the movie\u2019s debut this weekend, but it did denounce his comments.\n\nDepp plays the lead role in \u201cCity of Lies,\u201d a drama about the murders of Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G., so he\u2019s front-and-center in the marketing material. \u201cFantastic Beasts,\u201d however, is another story. Because Depp plays a villainous supporting role, the studio never planned for him to be heavily involved in hawking the film. Trailers and posters don\u2019t exactly hide Depp\u2019s involvement, but they don\u2019t trumpet it either. Warner Bros. hasn\u2019t ruled out asking the actor to participate in interviews for the film, but nothing definitive has been set in place. He is also intended to be a part of the third \u201cFantastic Beasts\u201d film, but that could theoretically change because Rowling has yet to deliver the script.\n\nDepp\u2019s other forthcoming big-budget movie, \u201cThe Invisible Man,\u201d appears to be stuck in development limbo. It was intended to be part of an effort to relaunch Universal\u2019s iconic movie monsters, but those plans had to be reworked after the first film in that proposed cinematic universe, 2017\u2019s \u201cThe Mummy,\u201d bombed at the box office.\n\nThe Rolling Stone story, which portrays Depp engaging in a deeply unhealthy lifestyle, could potentially lead to trouble with insurance companies that bond the actor\u2019s productions. Actors such as Robert Downey Jr., who famously struggled with drug and alcohol addiction, had insurance headaches before cleaning up their acts. Of course, Downey\u2019s drug problems landed him in prison, making his issues more extreme.\n\nAll of these Depp-related headaches come while the actor\u2019s box office powers appear to be waning. Recent Depp vehicles such as \u201cBlack Mass\u201d and \u201cAlice Through the Looking Glass\u201d were financial duds, and last summer\u2019s \u201cPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales\u201d was the second-lowest grossing film in the franchise.\n\nThat may be Depp\u2019s biggest crime. Hollywood can accept almost anything, except for failure."}

Meanwhile, rumors that her father, Tom Cruise, is fighting to get custody rights and that she allegedly dislikes Katie Holmes\u2019 new relationship have been debunked.\n\nHollywood Life reported on Wednesday that a \u201csource close to the [family]\u201d claimed that the 12-year-old girl started taking acting classes recently. \u201cShe\u2019s caught the acting bug.

(@suricruise.official) on Aug 22, 2018 at 9:32am PDT\n\nAs a daughter of two very popular actors, it should not be difficult for Suri to find inspirations leading to her dream of becoming an actress as well. But Hollywood Life\u2019s source claimed that the young lady started wanting to become an actress when she visited the set of \u201cThe Kennedys: After Camelot.\u201d Holmes played the late Jackie Kennedy in the 2017 miniseries.\n\nThe insider stated further that Suri Cruise was fascinated with how the actors prepared for their scenes, especially with their \u201chair, makeup and wardrobe.\u201d It is not strange for children of popular actors to follow their parents\u2019 legacy. And the report claimed that Katie Holmes is totally on board with Suri\u2019s dream. However, Tom Cruise reportedly thinks his daughter is still quite young to be starting an acting career.\n\nIn other news, there has been a recent spike in the number of published rumors that Tom Cruise is fighting to get custody of his 12-year-old daughter. The reports also said that the \u201cMission Impossible\u201d actor is trying to win back Suri by showering her with gifts aside from his alleged renewed efforts in court.\n\nRecently, it was also reported that Suri Cruise had been \u201cbegging\u201d her mom Katie Holmes to ditch her relationship with boyfriend Jamie Foxx. There were recent claims that Suri does not approve of how the singer-actor treats the 39-year-old \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek\u201d alum.\n\nA post shared by Suri Cruise Holmes ???? (@suricruise.official) on Aug 21, 2018 at 9:16am PDT\n\nLuckily, rumor fact-checking outlet Gossip Cop has debunked these stories. The site calls out tabloids spreading reports about Tom Cruise\u2019s recent efforts to take his daughter from Holmes. Gossip Cop even suggested that the so-called insiders are merely \u201cguessing and speculating\" after dissecting their quoted statements.\n\nMeanwhile, Gossip Cop also debunked the story that Suri Cruise does not like Foxx due to allegations that he continuously flirts with other women \u2014 another story that has also been repeatedly refuted. Holmes\u2019 spokespersons did not comment on this rumor but Gossip Cop said that a \u201cconfidante\u201d of Holmes already denied these claims."}

{"label": false, "txt": "Every summer, rumors of Big Deal releases from marquee artists run rampant. This summer, the same thing is happening, but there\u2019s one crucial difference: Artists are throwing everything they have into projects with actual concrete release dates. By the end of June alone, we\u2019re all but guaranteed to have new albums from Kanye West, Drake, Pusha-T, Christina Aguilera, and much more. By the end of summer, there\u2019s a very real chance that a Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z album could exist \u2026 or maybe not? Check out the list of just some of the (major, major) highlights of this summer\u2019s stacked crop of album releases. If all of these actually come out in the next three months, maybe everyone can take the rest of the year off from making music so we can catch up.\n\nChvrches, Love Is Dead (May 25)\n\nChvrches never gets enough credit for arriving early to modern pop music\u2019s booming trap/EDM party, but one hopes the new Love Is Dead will win the Glasgow trio the respect it deserves for its solid track record of windswept hooks and disarming lyrics. The sticky melodies and explosive drums of the new single \u201cMiracle\u201d seem to suggest that lead singer Lauren Mayberry and her bandmates Martin Doherty and Iain Cook are playing for keeps the third time around. \u2014Craig Jenkins\n\nPusha-T, Daytona (May 25)\n\nAs far as excuses for not releasing an album go, being president of Kanye West\u2019s record label isn\u2019t bad at all. The sequel to Pusha-T\u2019s 2013 solo debut, My Name Is My Name, has been awaited for so long that many a fan might have forgotten to await it any longer; even the brief prelude album, Darkest Before Dawn, that Push released to tide listeners over is three years old at this point. To be sure, the ex-Clipse rapper has had his hands full since being named head of GOOD Music (just imagine having to field responses to Kanye\u2019s recent antics), but he\u2019s long overdue for a collection of his own quality sound. Here\u2019s hoping that Daytona\u2019s Ye-curated beats and Push\u2019s hallmark coke-rap lyrics are enough to stem the drought. \u2014Frank Guan\n\nFather John Misty, God\u2019s Favorite Customer (June 1)\n\nIf Father John Misty could cut back on his antics long enough to let his music speak for itself, he might enjoy a reputation as one of the sharper singer-songwriters working today. He can be a ham off record, but in song, he is a humorist whose preening nihilism is a mirror on the principal absurdity of being alive right now, and whose earnest moments deal in heartbreaking sentimentality. The forthcoming God\u2019s Favorite Customer is a batch of clever, silly love songs like \u201cDisappointing Diamonds Are the Rarest of Them All\u201d and gutting confessionals like \u201cPlease Don\u2019t Die.\u201d \u2014CJ\n\nNatalie Prass, The Future and the Past (June 1)\n\nNatalie Prass is a singer-songwriter as true to the form as they come. She makes quietly devastating songs that are committed to that genre\u2019s fundamentals, but her new album is something different. It\u2019s what singer-songwriters sound like when they experiment with jazz and give their sound an old-school R&B sheen. Her new music is polished and upbeat (\u201cSisters, \u201cShort Court Style\u201d), reminiscent of Feist at her best. Every ounce of fun that it sounds like Natalie had making the record comes through, from front to back. \u2014Dee Lockett\n\nOneohtrix Point Never, Age Of (June 1)\n\nAfter a productive few years that included scoring the Safdie Brothers\u2019 film Good Time, collaborating with FKA Twigs, Anohni, and David Byrne, opening for Nine Inch Nails, and releasing his seventh album as Oneohtrix Point Never, Garden of Delete, Dan Lopatin is back with the follow up to GoD. It\u2019s a more subdued affair, and it\u2019s often paranoid and beautiful \u2014 filled with dread, anxiety, and a fractured take on rock mythology as filtered through prog, smooth jazz, and noise music. \u2014Sam Hockley-Smith\n\nKanye West, TBA (June 1)\n\nKanye West\u2019s cockiness has always been a gift and a curse, but the rapper\u2019s last month of questionable political and ideological choices still feels impossible to process. It\u2019s tough to take your eyes off modern pop music\u2019s most controversial and compelling figure, even when he looks to be hurtling into a bad space and carrying you with him. New music is imminent; one hopes it breaks the trollish tone of the scat rhyme \u201cLift Yourself\u201d and the dry Inherit the Wind vibes of the combination rap battle and political debate \u201cYe vs. the People.\u201d If it doesn\u2019t \u2026 it was a good run. \u2014CJ\n\nJorja Smith, Lost & Found (June 8)\n\nThere are a lot of singers born from the SoundCloud R&B generation that, like their rap counterparts, all kind of blend together. But Jorja Smith stands out because she\u2019s vocally a touch above the rest: She sings at whisper volume like all her peers have apparently been trained to do, but there\u2019s so much quality, clarity, and texture to her voice that you forgive her for playing to the trend. Jorja\u2019s a bit Gabrielle, a bit Sade, and a whole lot of pure talent. Her debut album is not to be missed. \u2014DL\n\nLily Allen, No Shame (June 8)\n\nYou either like Lily Allen, really fuck with her, or think she\u2019s a hack. There\u2019s really no in-between. Lily Allen has been polarizing from out of the gate. Her new music, though, wrestles with getting older, motherhood, and the tremendous personal loss she\u2019s experienced in her life. How do you exist as an adult when you\u2019re still emotionally an adolescent? Lily Allen\u2019s still figuring it out, and she sounds better for it. Skeptical? Give \u201cHigher\u201d a spin. \u2014DL\n\nSerpentwithfeet, toil (June 8)\n\nJosiah Wise, who records as serpentwithfeet, has a voice that sounds sacred. It\u2019s too big to be intimate, but too fragile to be for everyone. In other words, this isn\u2019t music you\u2019re going to throw on at your next summer barbecue. If you can, unplug all the electronics in your house, close all the windows, and sweat through the whole album in one go. You\u2019ll come out the other side feeling like you went through something spiritual. \u2014SHS\n\nSnail Mail, Lush (June 8)\n\nSnail Mail\u2019s Lindsey Jordan is only 18 years old, but she\u2019s already got the genre buzzing about her. And for good reason: Her songs are honest and shockingly self-aware for her age, and she knows how to write a memorable hook (\u201cDon\u2019t you like me for me?\u201d on \u201cPristine\u201d gets me every time). \u2014DL\n\nLykke Li, so sad so sexy (June 8)\n\nWe could tell you that Lykke Li\u2019s new album sounds part trap, part lush pop, and part completely indescribable \u2014 kind of like all the music of her past but with a Charli XCX filter (see: \u201chard rain\u201d). Or we could just tell you that the Meryl Streep is apparently a big, big fan. What more do you need to know? \u2014DL\n\nKids See Ghost, Kids See Ghost (June 8)\n\nIt\u2019s not rude, at this point, to suggest that the partnership between Kanye and Kid Cudi has seen better days. Though highly influential on a younger generation, Cudi\u2019s left-field, art-damaged hip-hop has suffered from bloat and aimlessness in recent years; Ye\u2019s reputation for keen trendspotting and canny trendsetting has hardly fared better. Uniting under the banner of Kids See Ghost, the duo\u2019s first album together will show how much they have left to bring out in each other. \u2014FG\n\nKanye and Nas, TBA (June 15)\n\nRap summits like \u201cStill Dreaming,\u201d \u201cWe Major,\u201d and \u201cFigure It Out\u201d are proof Nas and Kanye West have great chemistry, so a full-length Nas album produced by West sounds like a hip-hop head\u2019s pipe dream. It exists now \u2026 but true to the crucible of improbability and disappointment that is 2018, both men have come under fire in the weeks since the project was announced, Ye for attempting to establish a brotherly rapport with Donald Trump, and Nas for an interview in which his ex-wife Kelis said that he got physical with her during disputes. Does it come up on the record? Do they carry on business as usual? Can they? \u2014CJ\n\nChristina Aguilera, Liberation (June 15)\n\nWhat does an Xtina album sound like in 2018? That\u2019s the million-dollar question, given her six-year absence from making music. Christina has struggled to adapt to the evolving pop sphere \u2014 usually because she\u2019s ahead of the curve. Lately, she\u2019s been continuing her tradition of weird collaborative choices by having Kanye West co-produce Liberation\u2019s first single, \u201cAccelerate\u201d (and he has another on the album), but her second single with Demi Lovato, \u201cFall in Line,\u201d is more traditional Big Pop vocal gymnastics. Which means this album could go either way. \u2014DL\n\nJay Rock, Redemption (June 15)\n\nJay Rock is an extremely charismatic rapper, which is why it feels odd to say that he\u2019s also TDE\u2019s secret weapon. He\u2019s forceful, with a cocky sense of humor. He\u2019s got a great ear for beats, and, in the form of \u201cKing\u2019s Dead,\u201d he\u2019s already in possession of one of the year\u2019s best singles (\u201cWin\u201d isn\u2019t too shabby either). For whatever reason, though, he hasn\u2019t carved out the same distinct lane for himself as Kendrick, Schoolboy Q, and Ab-Soul have. Whatever happens, Redemption has a strong chance at being a standout of 2018. \u2014SHS\n\nOnyx Collective, Lower East Side Suite Part Three (June 15)\n\nThat this is not the only jazz album on this list says a lot about the extended, multiyear moment jazz is having in pop culture right now. Onyx Collective, the crew of downtown New York jazz kids, are making music that recalls the genre\u2019s greats, without being beholden to years and years of jazz rules and stuffiness. This is vital music made by a bunch of people who are young enough that they\u2019ll soon make something transcendent. \u2014SHS\n\nGang Gang Dance, Kazuashita (June 22)\n\nGang Gang Dance, 21st-century art-music heroes of downtown New York, are back with their first album since 2011\u2019s Eye Contact. The musical landscape has shifted since then, but the band\u2019s qualities are still intact. They still sound like a band entirely without musical boundaries, and they still have a knack for pulling together disparate elements \u2014 think traces of Japanese New Age, poolside house, and modern classical composition \u2014 into a whole that somehow actually all fits together. \u2014SHS\n\nKamasi Washington, Heaven and Earth (June 22)\n\nKamasi Washington is not known for his brevity. His albums regularly run over two hours, and only become truly rewarding after repeat listens. But still, anything Washington does is worth paying attention to. His sax playing was a crucial part of Kendrick Lamar\u2019s To Pimp a Butterfly, and his previous looooong player, 2015\u2019s The Epic, catapulted him into a strange world where jazz that leaned toward the spiritual was suddenly right at home on major festival stages all over the globe. Will his new album go further down that path? Will it be the album where Washington decides to get truly weird? Whatever happens, Heaven and Earth is another entry in the catalogue of an artist who is carving out an important space for himself at the intersection of popular music and new jazz. \u2014SHS\n\nNine Inch Nails, Bad Witch (June 22)\n\nIt\u2019s been five years since the last album from Trent Reznor\u2019s band, but the profile of the industrial auteur and his crew has remained high. With a pair of EPs, much touring, and a beyond-electrifying performance on the new season of Twin Peaks under their belt, Nine Inch Nails remain one of the more polished monoliths left standing in rock\u2019s world of rusty titans. Will their punishing aesthetic yield new revelations? In either case, much grimness awaits. \u2014FG\n\nTeyana Taylor, TBA (June 22)\n\nA lifetime seems to have passed between now and the release of Teyana Taylor\u2019s debut album, VII, in 2014. Then and now, Kanye West\u2019s GOOD Music is Taylor\u2019s label, but GOOD Music no longer carries the same meaning or cachet that it used to: With Kanye drifting into fields other than music, the label has been effectively rudderless. It\u2019s hardly the situation a gifted R&B singer still searching for her breakout collection would want, but it\u2019s the one Taylor\u2019s stuck with; no doubt she\u2019ll be doing her best to make her own voice heard over the unruly cant of her executive producer. \u2014FG\n\nFlorence + The Machine, High As Hope (June 29)\n\nA voice as huge as Florence Welch\u2019s was bound to tip fully into the mainstream at some point, and if the credits for her upcoming fourth album are any indication, that point is now. It\u2019s a tasteful turn, of course: Executive producer Emile Haynie (Bruno Mars, Lana Del Rey) governs the transition, with Jamie xx and Sampha pitching in on a track each. \u201cSky Full of Song\u201d and \u201cHunger,\u201d the two lead singles, suggest a collection whose beauty lies in its boldness; even before its release, High As Hope is living up to its name. \u2014FG\n\nLet\u2019s Eat Grandma, I\u2019m All Ears (June 29)\n\nIt\u2019s hard not to mention the British indie-pop duo Let\u2019s Eat Grandma without mentioning their extreme precocity. With both members still in their teens, the fact can\u2019t easily be overlooked. Perhaps aided by the fact that they\u2019ve been friends since childhood, Rosa Walton and Jenny Hollingworth have already succeeded in carving out a strange lane of their own. Their sound borrows widely without ever sounding derivative; as the three singles for their sophomore effort I\u2019m All Ears show, they come in at smart, weird, synthetic angles with a lot of verve. \u2014FG\n\nDirty Projectors, Lamp Lit Prose (July 13)\n\nDave Longstreth is full of ideas and in a rush to transmit them. Dirty Projectors, his band, released its first four albums in the space of three years; the pace slackened somewhat once Amber Coffman joined the band on vocals and guitar, but now that Coffman and Longstreth have broken up, he seems eager to make up for lost time. From the looks of the single \u201cBreak-Thru,\u201d the successor to last year\u2019s breakup album, Dirty Projectors, is shaping up to be bizarre. \u2014FG\n\nNicki Minaj, Queen (August 10)\n\nThe title of Nicki\u2019s new album, her fourth, takes two meanings at once: Along with its usual regal meaning, it\u2019s a reference to her home borough of Queens. In both cases, there\u2019s a sense of reiteration that suggests either renewal or exhaustion. Little that has passed since the 2014 release of The Pinkprint has dented Nicki\u2019s commercial appeal or her superstar status, but all the same, her lyrics have showed signs of staleness and her public image has lost some of its candy-colored luster. Not to mention how, in the distant Bronx, a new monarch has been crowned. You don\u2019t have to compare Nicki to Cardi or Queen to Invasion of Privacy, but if you do, the comparison is only going to flatter one side. Can Nicki\u2019s punch lines and posturing outmatch Cardi\u2019s realism and novelty? There\u2019s only one way to find out. \u2014FG\n\nMitski, Be the Cowboy (August 17)\n\nMitski\u2019s music works through concentration: By giving up range, it gains in intensity. The solo artist\u2019s indie rock locks onto her relationship status and seizes it for dear life. It\u2019s an aesthetic that doesn\u2019t expand or expound, but also doesn\u2019t need to. The fundamentals are always complicated enough if you really zoom in. The title of the lead single, \u201cGeyser,\u201d is a helpful metaphor \u2014 an abrupt blast of feeling that ends no less abruptly. After Be the Cowboy comes out, expect Mitski\u2019s small but fanatical audience to grow somewhat less small and even more fanatical than ever. \u2014FG\n\nAnderson .Paak, TBA (TBA)\n\nLike the brilliant rapper and producer Madlib, Anderson .Paak is from Oxnard, California. Also like Madlib, .Paak\u2019s whole style to date skews more toward smoking weed at sunrise and spending days buried in mounds of rare records as a way of avoiding the harsh realities of the world. Up to this point, .Paak\u2019s music has existed largely in the realm of stoned soul and introspective rap that took its time to get to where it wanted to go. Then he released \u201cBubblin,\u201d a track that manages to evoke Busta Rhymes\u2019s hoarse growl without being annoying about it. Songs this good don\u2019t really tend to come out in a vacuum, which (hopefully) means we\u2019ll be getting a full album from .Paak this summer. \u2014SHS\n\nWild Nothing, TBA (TBA)\n\nGemini, the 2010 debut LP from Jack Tatum, a.k.a. Wild Nothing, was a gorgeous slice of bedroom pop that \u2014 stay with me here \u2014 sounded like a warm summer evening. That\u2019s a major clich\u00e9, but I\u2019m using it because it\u2019s really the best way to capture the combination of hope and calm that radiated from every track on that album. Ensuing releases were more robust and fleshed out with a full band. While they didn\u2019t retain the same magic as the first LP, they made up for it through instrumental intricacy and strong hooks. We\u2019re due for another Wild Nothing album this summer, and while it\u2019d be a long shot to assume that it would have the same low-budget (in a good way), gauzy feel of Gemini, that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t be another excellent entry in the catalogue of a project that has virtually perfected the art of writing about romance. \u2014SHS\n\nPopcaan, Forever (TBA)\n\nThere are few better songs than Popcaan\u2019s \u201cEverything Nice.\u201d I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s the best song of all time, but it belongs in a category that bears the hallmarks of perfection: It\u2019s catchy, wistful, warm, and though it sounds very much like the era we live in, it\u2019s not going to sound dated in a couple decades either. With the bar set that high, it\u2019s not surprising that Popcaan\u2019s \u201cBody So Good,\u201d the first single from his upcoming album Forever, is not as good as \u201cEverything Nice,\u201d but what is? It\u2019s just another sign that Forever is going to be full of jams to soundtrack pretty much anything you\u2019d ever want to do outside. \u2014SHS\n\nMozzy, TBA (TBA)\n\nSacramento\u2019s Mozzy, already hugely popular in some rap circles, got offered a prime spot on the Kendrick Lamar\u2013helmed Black Panther soundtrack, and in a perfect world, it would open the door to a whole new swath of fans who didn\u2019t even realize that they needed Mozzy in their lives. The main question for me: Will this album reach the heights of 2017\u2019s excellent 1 Up Top Ahk, which was an often brutal, touching meditation on violence, death, and the struggles that come from both? \u2014SHS\n\nSOB X RBE, TBA (TBA)\n\nThe Bay Area teen rappers of SOB x RBE are spiky, enthusiastic rhymers whose syllables sometimes tumble out so quickly it feels like they\u2019re racing against time. The quartet\u2019s first two mixtapes, SOB x RBE and GANGIN, were cluster bombs bursting with youthful energy, banging West Coast beats, clever sample choices, and frightening, precocious street wisdom. A studio album is a chance to build on what has been a great start. It\u2019ll be exciting to watch this group grow. \u2014CJ\n\nBrockhampton, Puppy (June TBA)\n\nMusic fans are impatient. Pretty much the second after an album comes out, we\u2019re speculating about a follow-up. It\u2019s definitely unhealthy, but I get it: It\u2019s exciting to think that an artist you love may have the best song you\u2019ve ever heard in their back pocket, and they just need to get it together to release it. Brockhampton \u2014 the rap group/boy band (they\u2019re really just a rap group but they call themselves a boy band, so let\u2019s just go with it) \u2014 released three albums in 2017, each one better than the previous, which implies that Puppy, which is probably an album and not an actual baby dog, and is potentially due to come out next month, could be their most fully realized work yet. \u2014SHS\n\nDrake, Scorpion (June TBA)\n\nIf you read much astrology, you know that Scorpios are said to be passionate, guarded, occasionally vengeful people. If you listen to much Drake, you\u2019ve often heard \u201cOctober\u2019s Very Own\u201d live up to the characteristics of his sign. Drake naming the next album Scorpion and leading with a song like \u201cGod\u2019s Plan\u201d \u2014 where the rapper-singer celebrates his friends and successes while obsessing over the many people he knows can\u2019t stand him \u2014 most likely means this summer we\u2019ll be awash in joyous, passive-aggressive jams like \u201cEnergy\u201d and \u201cFake Love.\u201d \u2014CJ\n\nAriana Grande, Sweetener (July TBA)\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about Ariana Grande\u2019s fourth album so far: It\u2019s led by the outstanding U.K. garage-indebted first single, \u201cNo Tears Left to Cry\u201d; was half produced by Pharrell, and the other half by Max Martin; will reportedly sound like 1,000 Arianas multiplied and layered over each other; song titles include \u201cGod Is a Woman\u201d (!!!) and \u201cGet Well Soon\u201d; and she took the lead on writing all of its songs for the first time in her career. Oh, and if it\u2019s about love, then that lover will no longer be Mac Miller, but SNL\u2019s Pete Davidson. She said just this week that she\u2019s been adding more songs, so it\u2019s possible! \u2014DL\n\nTroye Sivan, Bloom (August 31)\n\nBy now it should be clear what our sweet prince Troye Sivan intends to serve with his sophomore album, Bloom: bops on bops on more bops. \u201cMy My My!\u201d and \u201cBloom\u201d are a breath of fresh air in the straight-and-narrow pop landscape, and it appears his new album will lean even heavier on the \u201980s pop palette he clearly loves. If Hayley Kiyoko is our Lesbian Jesus, Troye Sivan is the Gay Holy Spirit. #20GayTeen is still going strong! \u2014DL\n\nCarrie Underwood, Cry Pretty (September 14)\n\nCarrie Underwood is one of the great singers of our time; her rise to country industry dominance is one of American Idol\u2019s most resounding success stories. Across records like \u201cBefore He Cheats,\u201d \u201cBlown Away,\u201d and \u201cChurch Bells,\u201d Underwood offers note-perfect vocal performances and intimate glimpses into the struggles of complicated American women. If the boiling intensity of the title track is any indication, this year\u2019s Cry Pretty will serve up more of the same. \u2014CJ\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, ???? (TBA)\n\nWhat are Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z up to? It\u2019s the perennial question of our time. But for the purposes of this list, let\u2019s take a stab at answering it: On June 6, Bey and Hov will hit the road for the sequel to their On the Run tour, which can mean two things. (1) They\u2019ll use this as another opportunity to promote their old solo work in a two-for-one deal, or (2) they have that long-rumored joint album (which was recently confirmed by Jay-Z to exist) dropping imminently. The two were spotted in Jamaica pre-Beychella filming visuals for something, so stay tuned. \u2014DL\n\nA$AP Rocky, Testing (TBA)\n\nIt\u2019s hard to fault Rocky for being late with his third album, the dude has had a lot on his plate. Since A$AP Yams\u2019s untimely death, he\u2019s had to take over direction of the entire A$AP crew; between building bridges with the fashion world and bringing projects from his affiliates into fruition, the question wasn\u2019t whether Testing would be delayed, but for how long. Specific details are lacking, but heralded by the tripped-out video for the Moby-sampling \u201cA$AP Forever,\u201d Rocky\u2019s Testing album is sure to show off an artist carefully negotiating between disparate realms: Harlem streets and Paris runways, the sounds of the South and the East. \u2014FG\n\nChildish Gambino, TBA (TBA)\n\nIf the fifth element of hip-hop is arguing, then the sixth is wild speculation \u2014 so let\u2019s do some speculating. In between beefing up the Star Wars franchise and making the best television show, Donald Glover has been working on new music. If you had a hit like \u201cThis Is America\u201d on your hands, wouldn\u2019t you want to get an album out into the world while people were still dissecting every second? \u2014SHS"}
{"label": false, "txt": "Tim McGraw and Faith Hill have one of the most iconic love stories in country music. A true musical power couple, this Tennessee duo is incredibly strong together \u2013 as we've seen with their decades of duets and their consistently growing Soul2Soul world tour. Not to mention their ever-present, electric chemistry.\n\nBut this road to being one of our favorite couples to watch hasn't always been a straight line for Tim and Faith. Yes, they now have an exhibit at the Country Music Hall of Fame (aptly subtitled Mississippi Woman/Louisiana Man), three gorgeous daughters, and countless Grammy, CMA, ACM, and Billboard awards \u2013 but they've also experienced some detours.\n\nHowever, the end result for team McGraw-Hill is still the same: Tim and Faith love each other more than ever.\n\n@FaithHill - \u201cHappy anniversary baby Got you on my mind\u201d A post shared by Tim McGraw (@thetimmcgraw) on Oct 6, 2017 at 6:44pm PDT\n\nTheir journey began back in 1994, when the two met backstage at a Country Radio seminar in Nashville. The sparks between them were instant \u2013 much to the chagrin of Tim's then-girlfriend, as he told Billboard in a recent cover story. \u201cFor me, there was an intense physical attraction. I guess my girlfriend saw it in my eyes. She said, \u2018I don\u2019t want you around her.\u2019\u201d\n\nDuring a visit to The Bobby Bones Show in Nashville, the two talked about how they started dating. \"It took a bunch of times [of asking her out],\" Tim said. But, the \"official\" first time, as Faith describes, was something out of a Southern storybook.\n\n\"[Tim] brought me chicken and dumplings. [He] came to my house [unannounced]. He knocked on my door, and he had a bowl of homemade chicken dumplings.\"\n\n\"And cornbread!\" Tim chimed in.\n\n\"He said, 'I made these myself. They're homemade from scratch.' He had the bowl covered in aluminum foil, and he had a spoon and a fork on top of the bowl. He said, 'I didn't know if you liked to eat your dumplings with a spoon or a fork.'\"\n\n\"You make up for your inadequacies,\" Tim laughed.\n\nIn 1996, when Tim decided to ask a then-engaged Faith to open for him on his first headlining tour. Just a few months later, the country lovebirds were dueting together onstage and shared a not-so-subtle kiss. In a whirlwind romance, the two married in October 1996.\n\nWhere it all started\u2026 Follow @Officialcmhof for more on our exhibit coming in November! #CMHOF50 A post shared by Faith Hill (@faithhill) on Jan 12, 2017 at 6:04am PST\n\nAlthough the couple was seemingly meant to be, there was one part of their story that connected them very strongly \u2013 both had family backgrounds that left them searching for a missing piece of the puzzle.\n\nFor Tim, that came in the route of his famous baseball father, Tug McGraw, who denied paternity after Tim's mother became pregnant coming into her senior year of high school. With an abusive stepfather and a biological father who wouldn't acknowledge him, Tim struggled with filling that gap.\n\nFaith's search, as an adopted child, was in her \"gypsy\" spirit that didn't seem to fit in with the rest of her family. She told Billboard, \u201cI used to think there was some kind of conspiracy, that I must be the daughter of one of my aunts. And of course I used to dream I was Elvis\u2019 daughter. I have a great family: salt of the earth, hardworking. But I\u2019m a gypsy at heart. I had a spirit that was completely outside what my family was. I didn't know anyone I was related to, biologically, which gives you a sense of not \u00adknowing who you are.\u201d\n\nMcGraw summed up their connection through these family issues perfectly. \u201cI knew I had that \u00adinstability and dysfunction in me, from the way I grew up. And when I met Faith, I knew I needed her in my life\u2013to keep me stable, solid and on track.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Tim & Faith Announced A New Joint Album\n\nAnd on track the two have stayed, even through Tim's drug and alcohol abuse in the mid-2000s. Faith gave Tim \u2013 father to Gracie, Maggie Elizabeth, and Audrey \u2013 an ultimatum. With the choice to keep his family intact, Tim shed forty pounds and started training with a martial arts master.\n\nThere is no man that could be loved more than you.

There's been rampant speculation that the reality star And Forbes' youngest almost-billionaire and her beau Travis Scott are expecting a second child. Even though its only been a few months since Kylie and Travis' first daughter, Stormi, was born it's very possible that she could be pregnant.\n\nWe, of course, may not know for awhile as she didn't officially confirm her last pregnancy until three days after she gave birth.\n\nHere is what we know so far about the Kylie pregnancy rumors:\n\n1. A source said they were trying for another baby while on vacation.\n\nA post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on May 1, 2018 at 11:12am PDT\n\nKylie and Travis went on vacation to Turks and Caicos to celebrate Travis' birthday. While there, they were reportedly doing more than just celebrating. \"Kylie and Travis have been having amazing baby-making sex while on vacation. Travis is totally turned on by Kylie now that she has bounced back from her pregnancy and has all of her insane curves again. Travis finds Kylie irresistible in her bikini and thinks she looks amazing,\" a source said.\n\n2.

So they can grow up being best friends.\" Kendall is two years older than Kylie so they still have a bit more time.\n\n3. Kylie loves seeing Travis be a dad.\n\nA post shared by Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott (@kyandtravis) on Jul 17, 2018 at 10:45am PDT\n\nA source said, \"Nothing has been sexier to Kylie than to watch Travis become an amazing father to their daughter. Things between them have never been better.\"\n\n4. Kylie had a pregnancy scare.\n\nA month ago, Kylie reportedly had a pregnancy scare. A source close to Kylie told Hollywood Life the scare \"really freaked her out,\" but that \"Travis was super excited to have another kid right away. [Kylie] was totally upset over the idea of being pregnant again so quickly. She has been so relieved to get her body back after the last year, so she is not ready to go through it all again so soon after giving birth to Stormi,\" the source explains. \"Kylie thought that it must be some miracle for her to get pregnant again so soon after giving birth, but quickly realized it was only a false alarm.\"\n\n5. She's gotten pregnant quickly before.\n\nJust one month into her relationship with Travis Scott the young mogul found out she was expecting. She says this was because their relationship felt so natural and drama-free from the public eye. \"We had a lot of downtime. It was organic. And we would just go to these random cities. We got to not be who we really were. Like, if we were in LA, I feel like it would\u2019ve been way different. Everything happened for a reason. We weren\u2019t going out as \u2018Kylie and Trav.\u2019 We would just be in Cleveland, walking the street for hours. We would go on walks, and no one would bother us,\" Kyile said.\n\n6.

Travis and Kylie like to keep things private.\n\nA post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on May 7, 2018 at 9:55pm PDT\n\nKylie has said, \"For sure, I know he [Travis] doesn't like the attention. That's why we just go the extra mile to keep our relationship super private, or like, if he has events or something, I won't come. Because I want him to do his own thing. I want him to be him. I don't want it to be Kylie and Trav. If people don't ever see us together, that's okay with me, because we just do our thing.\" So if she is, indeed, pregnant, we probably won't know until she's totally ready to share.\n\nMolly Given is a writer living in Philadelphia and lover of all things to do with mystery and magic in life.

{"label": false, "txt": "George Clooney rented a private island for Amal Clooney's birthday, according to a tabloid report. It's even claimed the actor spent as much as $2 million for the celebration. Gossip Cop, however, is exclusively told by a rep for the couple that the claims aren't true.\n\nLower/SilverHub/REX/Shutterstock\n\nThe allegations are featured in the New Zealand edition of Woman's Day, under the headline, \"Party In Paradise: George Spoils His Girl.\" The story begins by asserting that although the Oscar winner is now a father of twins, he \"still knows how to keep the romance alive, treating his wife Amal to a lavish $2 million worth of gifts to celebrate her 40th birthday early this month.\" A so-called \"insider\" is quoted as saying, \"George wanted to go all-out for Amal's milestone and do something extra-special, so he hired out a private island.\"\n\nAmal's birthday was on February 3 and it's not said exactly when this supposed trip allegedly took place. But the gossip magazine maintains George \"had been scouting locations for months before deciding on the exclusive Fijian island resort of Vatu Vara, which set him back more than $1.2 million for a six-night stay.\"' It's further claimed he enlisted a \"top event-planning team from Los Angeles to arrange everything, including chefs, a spectacular fireworks display and the arrival of all her loved ones.\"\n\n\"Money was no object,\" contends the outlet's supposed source, asserting, \"It was absolutely perfect. Amal had the time of her life and George ensured it was a birthday to remember.\" The publication also details other \"pricey birthday treats\" the star supposedly gave his wife, including a $400,000 gold antique bracelet. As for which \"loved ones\" were present for this alleged vacation, it's claimed, \"George flew in Amal's close pals Rande Gerber and Cindy Crawford.\"\n\nThere's even a picture of the two couples together. But Gossip Cop recognized Amal's metallic gold dress, and after a little digging, we discovered that the photo is actually from 2015, which is why it looked familiar. So, where are the real snapshots from this trip? The tabloid has none because this purported \"party in paradise,\" as the magazine deems it, \"never happened,\" a rep for the Clooneys exclusively tells Gossip Cop.\n\nWhile the couple did celebrate her 40th birthday, there was no renting of a private island in Fiji. On the contrary, they didn't even leave the U.S. George actually whisked Amal away for a 24-hour getaway to Big Sur for her special day. The outlet was apparently too busy making up details about a fictional trip to report on the real one that actually took place.\n\nMore on Gossip Cop:\n\nStory claiming the truth about Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez having kids is made-up\n\nSofia Richie and Scott Disick are NOT moving to Mexico\n\nPrince William NOT struggling with parenthood despite report"}

{"label": false, "txt": "This week, in the midst of rising panic and gathering storms, some lucky paparazzi spotted the tabloid equivalent of the Loch Ness Monster.\n\nIn an industry of repetitive stories, unsubstantiated rumors, and Bachelor covers, these fateful shots of Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes holding hands on the beach in Malibu immediately made waves. To understand the magnitude of Holmes and Foxx\u2019s PDA, you have to venture back four years ago, to a pre-Trump era when Brangelina was still a thing and nobody knew what a Chainsmoker was. In 2013, photos surfaced of Foxx and Holmes dancing together at a Hamptons charity event. Ever since then, the rumored duo has gone to great lengths to insist that they\u2019re just friends, with varying degrees of success. In an October 2013 interview, Foxx called the dating rumors \u201cone hundred percent not true.\u201d Again in 2015, Foxx strongly reacted to the relationship rumors, retorting, \u201cWhat I\u2019ve learned about society today is that they\u2019re so thirsty. Especially in tabloid world and social media world, they\u2019re so thirsty to find any story\u2026 Sometimes when you read the stuff you\u2019re like, \u2018Wow! That\u2019s so not true!\u2019\u201d Holmes has refused to engage with the topic altogether. When pressed on her relationship status in 2016, the actress replied, \u201cThat\u2019s not something I want to answer.\u201d\n\nDespite JamKat\u2019s press defensive, there have been numerous leaks over the course of the alleged half-decade that they\u2019ve been allegedly dating. A blurry 2015 photo of the duo holding hands in a recording studio is perhaps the most damning evidence, along with a 2016 interview with Foxx\u2019s friend, reality TV star Claudia Jordan, who gushed that Foxx \u201cis very happy with [Holmes].\u201d Jordan quickly walked back her inadvertent confirmation, subsequently telling ET that, \u201cI have no knowledge of Jamie with Katie at all,\u201d adding, \u201cI\u2019ve never seen them together. He\u2019s never told me he\u2019s dating her.\u201d\n\nStill, as months and years passed, rumors of this celebrity coupling persisted. Anonymous sources insisted on Jamie and Katie\u2019s relationship status and tabloids, sensing a story even bigger and more factually accurate than Jennifer Aniston\u2019s phantom pregnancy, never gave up. While any secret celebrity dating scenario is fodder for a People cover or a clickbait headline, JamKat is a particularly elusive and fascinating pairing. That\u2019s because Foxx and Holmes\u2019 intense secrecy is rumored to be a condition of Holmes\u2019 2012 divorce from Tom Cruise, which was itself the ending of one of the most widely discussed and analyzed marriages in celebrity history.\n\nLong before Holmes and Cruise started dating, the leading man had a reputation for strange behavior\u2014the alleged result of his close relationship with the Church of Scientology.\n\nOne of the main celebrity faces of Scientology, Cruise appeared to have, at some point, handed over the reins of his personal life to the church. In Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief, Alex Gibney\u2019s 2015 documentary, Marty Rathbun, a former high-ranking Scientologist, confesses that he was assigned to sabotage Cruise\u2019s second marriage: \u201cI was to facilitate the breakup with Nicole Kidman.\u201d\n\nAccording to the film, Scientology head David Miscavige\u2014a good friend of Cruise\u2019s\u2014became suspicious of Kidman when she began to influence Cruise away from the church. Gibney\u2019s film claims that over the course of their marriage, Cruise even stopped returning Miscavige\u2019s calls. At that point, the documentary alleges, Miscavige resolved to get Kidman out of the picture. Rathbun elaborates that this campaign included spying on/wiretapping Kidman, \u201cauditing\u201d Cruise, and \u201cre-educating\u201d the couple\u2019s adopted children, Connor and Isabella. This all culminated in 2001, when Cruise divorced Kidman.\n\nA 2012 Vanity Fair article claimed that Miscavige subsequently made it his mission in 2004 to find Cruise a new girlfriend. Maureen Orth reported that, \u201cThe organization devised an elaborate auditioning process in which actresses who were already Scientology members were called in, told they were auditioning for a new training film, and then asked a series of curious questions including: \u2018What do you think of Tom Cruise?\u2019\u201d The search party, Orth reported, eventually landed on Homeland actress Nazanin Boniadi. Between 2004 and 2005, Boniadi reportedly dated the actor: \u201cIn a month-long preparation in October 2004, she was audited every day, a process in which she told a high-ranking Scientology official her innermost secrets and every detail of her sex life. Boniadi allegedly was told to lose her braces, her red highlights, and her boyfriend.\u201d\n\nWhen Boniadi was eventually flown to New York to meet her new boyfriend, she was given a confidentiality agreement \u201cspecifically about Cruise,\u201d claimed Vanity Fair. And while the relationship was initially successful, the actress quickly found herself running afoul of both Cruise and Miscavige: \u201cBy the third week in January, she was asked to move into Scientology\u2019s Celebrity Centre. Boniadi was told that Cruise \u2018wants someone with her own power\u2014like Nicole.\u2019 When she asked why Cruise would not break up with her himself, she was told he was not to be disturbed.\u201d (The Church of Scientology did not respond to The Daily Beast\u2019s requests for comment prior to publication.)\n\nBy April of 2005, Cruise was dating actress Katie Holmes, and just one month later he was enthusiastically holding forth on his budding relationship while jumping on Oprah Winfrey\u2019s couch.\n\nAccording to journalist Tony Ortega, who\u2019s covered the church since 1995, \u201cKatie made the effort initially to become a Scientologist herself, and then escaped later.\u201d Ortega told The Daily Beast about the actress\u2019 Scientology handler, Jessica Rodriguez, who was reportedly assigned to accompany Holmes during the Batman Begins press tour, recalling, \u201cJessica was answering questions for Katie in interviews, and it was really, really weird.\u201d Rumors of strange behavior and restrictions abounded during the couples\u2019 six-year marriage. (Miscavige was Cruise\u2019s best man at his and Holmes\u2019 2006 wedding.) According to one particularly striking claim, Cruise allegedly insisted that \u201chis wife stay silent while she was giving birth to baby Suri,\u201d in keeping with Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard\u2019s belief that absolute silence ought to be maintained throughout delivery.\n\nAs The Daily Beast previously reported, the final straw allegedly came when Holmes began to suspect that she would soon be separated from her and Cruise\u2019s young daughter, Suri: \u201cWhen Cruise and Holmes split in 2012, it was amidst rumors that the star feared her husband was planning to ship their daughter Suri off to Sea Org\u2014an elite training division of the Church that requires its members to sign a \u2018billion-year contract.\u2019\u201d Cruise and Holmes\u2019 hasty settlement, which was finalized just 10 days after Holmes filed for divorce, reportedly stipulated that Suri would have no relationship with the Church of Scientology. Unfortunately, this agreement appears to have wreaked havoc on Suri\u2019s relationship with her father, as the two are rarely seen together. In late June, InTouch reported that Cruise hadn\u2019t seen his 11-year-old daughter in person in \u201cmore than 1,381 days.\u201d This alleged separation is less shocking in light of the church\u2019s practice of \u201cdisconnecting\u201d congregants from family members who disapprove of Scientology.\n\nA RadarOnline report from last year alleged Holmes and Foxx\u2019s secrecy may also be a result of that high-stakes divorce settlement. The gossip site published a source who claimed that, \u201cKatie signed a clause in her quickie divorce settlement that prevents her from embarrassing Tom in various ways, like talking about him or Scientology, or publicly dating another man for five years after the divorce.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s allowed to date, but she cannot do so in a public fashion, and she\u2019s not supposed to let any boyfriend near their daughter, Suri,\u201d the source continued. \u201cKatie wanted out of the marriage so badly, she agreed to the terms\u2014and got $4.8 million in child support, plus another $5 million for herself.\u201d\n\nAnd the timing works out: Holmes and Cruise finalized their divorce in June 2012, meaning that the exes have only recently passed the five-year mark. If the rumors are true, Holmes and Foxx are now free to shout their love from the couches without fear of reprisal from Holmes\u2019 bizarre ex."}
{"label": false, "txt": "When members of the royal family tie the knot, there\u2019s a lot at stake\u2014including a whole lot of money. Which is why it might be surprising to some onlookers that, according to the Daily Mail, Prince Harry has declined to seek a prenuptial agreement before he marries Meghan Markle today in Windsor. But we spoke to two royal experts who said nobody should be shocked at this news. When it comes to the royals, prenups are simply not done.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nThis is not a celebrity marriage, it\u2019s a royal marriage.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think members of the royal family sign prenuptial agreements,\u201d says Katie Nicholl, author of Harry: Life, Loss, and Love. \u201cIt\u2019s commonplace with celebrity marriage, but this is not a celebrity marriage, it\u2019s a royal marriage.\u201d Nicholl says that Prince William and Kate Middleton also did not sign a prenuptial agreement, despite the very public divorce between William and Harry\u2019s parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana. And even though three of the Queen\u2019s four children have divorced, none apparently had a prenuptial agreement.\n\nYes, there is a large sum of money in the balance for this marriage, but the true, staggering wealth belongs to the Queen, so it wouldn\u2019t be divided up if Meghan and Harry did end up divorcing. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t need a prenuptial agreement to stop Windsor Castle from being cut in half in the event they divorce, because it\u2019s not Harry\u2019s,\u201d says Duncan Larcombe, author of Prince Harry: The Inside Story.\n\nLarcombe notes that Harry does have substantial wealth on his own, thanks to his inheritance from Princess Diana, but the Queen holds the vast majority of the royal property and fortune. The Queen's net worth has been estimated at around $500 million, while Prince Harry's is estimated anywhere from $25 to $40 million. Meghan also has her own money as a successful actress on Suits, reportedly making around $50,000 per episode of the long-running series.\n\nIf Meghan and Harry do ever divorce, Larcombe adds, the vast majority of negotiations would happen outside of court. For example, Diana received a new title, a financial settlement, and was entitled to royal security protection, although she turned that down. Plus, the Daily Mail notes that even though prenups are taken into account in U.K. divorces, they\u2019re not legally enforceable.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nAnd though royal divorces may have had a violent start, thanks to Henry VIII\u2019s habit for decapitation, royal splits try to make as few waves as possible in modern times. \u201cIn the modern history of the royal family, the divorce is described as amicable for PR reasons,\u201d Larcombe says, \u201cand the person who is departing the royal family, they\u2019re just looked after, and those arrangements are not done through court, they\u2019re done behind closed doors.\u201d"}

The contact confirmed to Gossip Cop that the supposed meeting between Shelton and Lambert is \u201ccompletely made up.\u201c\n\nIn addition, Shelton hasn\u2019t even been in Nashville since August, likely due to his commitments for The Voice. Although Shelton and Lambert were both at the ACM Honors in August, they never encountered one another at the event.\n\nWhile Shelton is completely devoted to The Voice right now, Lambert is preparing for the release of a double album. Called The Weight of These Wings, the album will make its debut on November 18th.\n\nThe Weight of These Wings will include 24 new songs from Lambert, including her latest single, \u201cVice.\u201d Give it a listen in the video below.\n\nNow On Spotify!

She\u2019s only days away from birth, maybe a week or two at the most, at least that is what she is hoping. She plans on giving birth in Ohio, rather than Beverly Hills like her sisters, to make it easier for Tristan to be with her for the birth,\u201d a source close to the KUWTK star tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. So exciting, right?\n\nBecause of Tristan\u2019s busy basketball schedule, Khloe decided to relocate to Cleveland, but that isn\u2019t stopping her famous family and friends from joining her on the special day. \u201cMalika [Haqq] is set to be with Khloe all along the way as will grandma Kris [Jenner] and some of Tristan\u2019s family too. Kim [Kardashian], Kourtney [Kardashian], and the rest of Khloe\u2019s siblings are also invited to the hospital and may make the trip to Ohio as well. However, you won\u2019t be seeing Caitlyn Jenner holding the new baby. Things between Khloe and her former step-dad have been icy as the pair have been estranged since Caitlyn\u2019s falling out with Kris,\u201d the source continued. We\u2019re hoping her baby\u2019s birth will bring them back together!\n\nNevertheless, we couldn\u2019t be more excited for Khloe, and her growing family. Throughout her pregnancy, she\u2019s been super open about her cravings, favorite moments, and even fears. As we previously told you, Khloe got super candid about breastfeeding after a fan told her to \u201cenjoy the pregnancy boobs\u201d on March 26. \u201cOh my gosh lol I\u2019m nervous about breastfeeding. I hear crazy things, but I\u2019ll fight through it and love it,\u201d Khloe replied. It\u2019s clear she\u2019s ready for motherhood, and we know she\u2019ll be fantastic!"}

{"label": false, "txt": "Yes, it tanked at the box office. But the movie is worth watching, if only as a curiosity.\n\nColumbia Pictures\n\nFew recent releases have flamed out quite so spectacularly as The Tourist, which opened stateside in December to tepid reviews and slower-than-expected business, and almost overnight became an object of ridicule. There have lately been money-losers of much greater magnitude (this month's Mars Needs Moms, for instance), but The Tourist's unique combination of flawless pedigree\u2014Angelina Jolie, Johnny Depp, white-hot European director\u2014and overall inertness made it an easy target. The film, nominally a classic action-romance picture trafficking in international mistaken-identity intrigue and outlandish financial crimes, essentially boils down to ball gowns, timepieces, and really nice stationary, and so viewers are faced with a choice between indulging in its lavish appointments, or beginning to make jokes at its expense.\n\nMost seemed to choose the latter option, including Golden Globes host Ricky Gervais, who in his opening monologue memorably demystified the film's two Globe nominations, its only awards-season recognition: \"I'd like to quash this ridiculous rumor going around that the only reason The Tourist was nominated was so the Hollywood Foreign Press could hang out with Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie. That is rubbish. That is not the only reason. They also accepted bribes.\" Cut to Depp, who was hiding behind a pair of sunglasses, chewing gum, his face fixed in a wince. The feature-length co-star of Gervais's joke arrives on home video this week (and on Netflix next month), offering a good opportunity for reappraisal. It should first of all be declared that The Tourist, in which British agent-gone-dark Jolie entangles unwitting math-teacher tourist Depp in a dangerous attempt to reunite with her mysterious fugitive lover, is not top-to-bottom rubbish. The second feature from German director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck\u2014easy to forget, since his debut, The Lives of Others, was such an assured (if unsubtle) piece of filmmaking\u2014is indeed a bit of a sophomore slump, but it doesn't quite deserve its low reputation, either.\n\nIn her championing of the Venice-set film, Movieline's Stephanie Zacharek extended the movie's elevation of really nice stuff from mere set dressing to full-blown theme, by comparing the star vehicle to a cocktail\u2014\"a Bellini, fizzy and sweet and dry all at the same time.\" While The Tourist's tonic qualities might be disputed, it does offer some substantial pleasures, particularly of the dry variety. These mostly come courtesy of Depp, in bewildered mode throughout, cast into a plot whose mechanics he can't fully grasp, but almost casually accepting of every new development\u2014recalling his career-best work in Jim Jarmusch's 1995 anti-Western Dead Man. Here Depp's character, Frank, dazedly stumbles through shootout chases and police interrogations, as if one of his beloved spy thrillers has sprung to life around him (Frank fumbles with a paperback called The Berlin Vendetta when Jolie's Elise takes a seat across from him on a train)."}

The pair had a public two-year romance.\n\nAmber Rose Breaks Up With Kanye West\n\nIn mid-2010, Rose called things off with West.

That December, the couple confirmed they were engaged in an Instagram post featuring Chyna\u2019s giant diamond ring.\n\nKanye West Starts Dating Kim Kardashian\n\nFresh off his split from Rose, West set his sights on his longtime friend and crush Kim Kardashian in early 2012. The pair were spotted out together and Kardashian\u2019s famous family even started pressing the reality star for details on her new romance (remember when he let her borrow his car?!).\n\nKanye West Raps About Wiz Khalifa, Amber Rose\n\nAs West\u2019s romance with Kardashian blossomed, so did that of his ex Rose and her new rapper fianc\u00e9, Wiz Khalifa. In April 2012, West released the song \u201cCold\u201d in which he rapped, \u201cOnly n\u2014a I got respect for is Wiz / And I\u2019ll admit, I had fell in love with Kim around the same time she had fell in love with him.\u201d\n\nAmber Rose Marries Wiz Khalifa After Welcoming Son Sebastian\n\nIn February 2013, Rose and Khalifa had their first child, son Sebastian, announcing the news on Twitter.

She didn\u2019t share photos from the private event until their one-year anniversary.\n\nNorth West Is Born\n\nFollowing a difficult pregnancy, Kim gave birth to her daughter, North West, in June 2013.

As new mom Kim worked hard to get back to her pre-baby weight in time for her wedding to West, she posted selfies in workout clothes with Chyna by her side.\n\nKanye West Marries Kim Kardashian\n\nAfter gracing the cover of Vogue in wedding couture, the A-list couple tied the knot in an elaborate European wedding weekend that began in Paris and ended with an Italian ceremony in May 2014.\n\nRob Kardashian Skips the Wedding, Remains Under the Radar\n\nThings got awkward when Kim\u2019s younger brother, Rob Kardashian, left Kim\u2019s wedding festivities early. His exit followed months of erratic behavior: avoiding appearances on the family\u2019s reality series, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, significant weight gain and depression. He\u2019s stayed out of the public eye ever since. \u201cHe sent me a long email the morning of [saying] that he was going to leave,\u201d Kim later said on Watch What Happens Live. \u201cThere was no fight.\u201d\n\nBlac Chyna and Tyga Split\n\nIn August 2014, the parents called it quits. \u201cThey are trying to keep it amicable,\u201d an insider told Us Weekly at the time. \u201cThey also have a lot of friends in common \u2014 Tyga is Kanye [West\u2019s] boy and Blac Chyna got close to [his wife] Kim [Kardashian] \u2014 so they don\u2019t want to make it weird.\u201d\n\nAmber Rose Splits From Wiz Khalifa\n\nDespite previously saying she wanted to be with Khalifa \u201cfor the rest of my life,\u201d Rose filed for divorce in September 2014, just 14 months after they tied the knot. \u201cI never knew what a true heartache felt like until now,\u201d Rose tweeted several weeks later.\n\nTyga Starts Dating Kylie Jenner\n\nIn the fall of 2014, Tyga and the youngest of the Kardashian-Jenner clan sparked a series of dating rumors after they were seen hanging out together regularly. In August 2014, Tyga hosted Kylie Jenner\u2019s 17th birthday party, and they continued to be spotted out together as the months went on. However, due to Jenner\u2019s underage status, the couple never publicly acknowledged their romance.\n\nAmber Rose Slams Kylie Jenner and Tyga\n\nFresh off her split from Khalifa, Rose befriended Chyna, who was now estranged from Kim after the Tyga/Kylie dating rumors. In February 2015, Rose appeared on The Breakfast Club radio show, where she gave her unfiltered thoughts on Jenner\u2019s relationship with Tyga. \u201cShe\u2019s a baby, she needs to go to bed at 7 o\u2019clock and relax,\u201d Rose said of Jenner. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.

He has a beautiful woman and a baby and left that for a 16-year-old who just turned 17.\u201d\n\nKhlo\u00e9 Kardashian Sparks Twitter Feud With Amber Rose\n\nNot willing to let her little sister get thrown under the bus, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian weighed in on the feud on Twitter. \u201c\u2019I was a stripper since I was 15 years old,\u2019 Amber Rose told Foxx. Please don\u2019t worry about my sister who has a career & her s\u2013t together at ONLY 17 people who live in glass houses shouldn\u2019t throw stones,\u201d Khlo\u00e9 tweeted, making note of Rose\u2019s past as a stripper. \u201cPlease stop talking about us in interviews mama. None of us talk about you.\u201d Her comments prompted an intense back-and-forth between the two.\n\nKanye West Gets Involved in Twitter Feud\n\nRose responded to Khlo\u00e9\u2019s tweets with a series of West-inspired memes. One read, \u201cWhen ur sister in law calls out ur ex for being a stripper but ur wife has a sex tape,\u201d referencing Kim\u2019s sex tape with singer Ray J. West shot back a few days later, making his own appearance on The Breakfast Club. \u201cShe\u2019s just soakin\u2019 in the moment. If Kim had dated me when I first wanted to be with her, there wouldn\u2019t be an Amber Rose,\u201d West said of his ex. \u201cIt\u2019s very hard for a woman to want to be with someone that\u2019s with Amber Rose. \u2026 I had to take 30 showers before I got with Kim.\u201d\n\n\ud83d\udc8b A post shared by Blac Chyna (@blacchyna) on Apr 21, 2015 at 4:34pm PDT\n\nBlac Chyna Mocks Kylie Jenner Online\n\nAs Jenner\u2019s romance with Tyga continued, his ex posted several telling photos via Instagram in April 2015, making light of the new relationship.

One such text read: \u201cI want to be with u.\u201d\n\nKylie Jenner Goes Public With Tyga on 18th Birthday\n\nIn August 2015, Jenner finally turned 18 and, now legal, went public with Tyga. The social media starlet had a blowout birthday bash, and her new official beau gifted her with two cars, including a $260,000 Ferrari.\n\nTyga Feuds With Blac Chyna Over Kylie Jenner\u2019s Ferrari\n\nThe pricey purchase sparked a fresh feud between Tyga, Chyna and Rose. TMZ reported that Tyga had leased the swanky gift, which Tyga claimed was a lie. \u201cWhen the hating don\u2019t work they start telling lies. #WhereYoFerarriTho?\u201d he captioned an Instagram selfie. Naturally, Rose chimed in, defending her friend with a photo of her own pink Ferrari. \u201cShe don\u2019t need a Ferrari she can Drive mine,\u201d she captioned the shot.\n\nKylie Jenner and Tyga Split, Get Back Together\n\nOn Tyga\u2019s 26th birthday in November 2015, the couple split and Jenner deleted almost all mentions of her flame from her Instagram account. But days later they made up, and Jenner described the rekindling romance as \u201cChaos\u201d in a new post.\n\n#nofilter A post shared by Annalu (@annalucardosod) on Dec 11, 2015 at 3:39pm PST\n\nTyga Has a Fling With a Brazilian Model\n\nUs exclusively broke the story in January 2016 that Tyga had been cheating on Jenner with Brazilian model Annalu Cardoso for months.

But never go against the family.\u201d After followers noted her quote was likely about Rob and Chyna, the reality star replied, \u201cYou guys do know I have about 100 family members correct? I was referring to a family member who just bailed out of doing my talk show today. But hey, maybe my quote can go towards a few people today.\u201d\n\nRob Kardashian Confirms the Relationship\n\nA day after Chyna\u2019s Instagram post, Rob reposted a meme of his new love holding a car seat. \u201cBlac Chyna probably out shopping rite now as she plan to give birth to the only next generation of the Kardashian Name! #BabyKardashian.\u201d He captioned the meme with the clover emoji, which became a secret symbol between the pair.

It started when Khalifa dissed the title of West\u2019s upcoming album, Waves. \u201cPlease don\u2019t take the wave,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cMax B is the wavy one. He created the wave. There is no wave without him.\u201d\n\nHe then went on to write, \u201cHit this kk and become yourself.\u201d Misunderstanding Khalifa\u2019s reference to Khalifa Kush weed, West then started ranting against the rapper on Twitter. \u201cLike, oh that\u2019s Ye and I can put his wife\u2019s initials on my twitter @WizKhalifa,\u201d West wrote. \u201cYou have distracted from my creative process. I went to look at your twitter and you were wearing cool pants.\u201d\n\nAs the tweets raged on, West slammed his ex Rose, writing, \u201c4th you let a stripper trap you. 5th I know you mad every time you look at your child that this girl got you for 18 years.\u201d\n\nAmber Rose Weighs In on Kanye/Wiz Twitter Beef\n\nNot willing to let her ex\u2019s insults slide, Rose responded with the tweet, \u201cAwww @kanyewest are u mad I\u2019m not around to play in ur a\u2013hole anymore? #FingersInTheBootyAssBitch.\u201d West later deleted his tweets, apologizing for the misunderstanding about Kim\u2019s initials, to which Rose replied, \u201cLol @kanyewest Now u wanna delete ur tweets cuz Muva has arrived? #TwitterFingers #UrGettingBodiedByAStripperN\u2014a.\u201d\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?

{"label": false, "txt": "Photo\n\nMiranda Kerr was 18, just out of high school, a girl from the Australian countryside curious about what the rest of the world had to offer, when she first visited New Zealand . Along with a close friend from Gunnedah, the pastoral town where she grew up, Kerr set out to experience what for many is the draw of New Zealand: to escape and explore, to get a little lost and, in the process, get a little found. They slept in a tent. Swam in natural hot springs. Hiked terrain so raw and depopulated and expansive it felt as if they were the first humans to discover it. Kerr didn\u2019t know it at the time, but her life would change significantly in the years that followed, thanks largely to her enviable genetic gifts: the long pale legs, the shimmering doe eyes and, most famously, the pert, dimpled cheeks that have made her one of the highest paid, most recognizable models in the world. Modeling, for Kerr, has been its own sort of adventure, one she will be the first to acknowledge as a stroke of good fortune not to be taken for granted. \u201cStill, that backpacking trip, just having that freedom, was one of the best times in my life,\u201d Kerr recently reflected. \u201cEver since, I\u2019ve wanted to get back to New Zealand.\u201d\n\nFor seven months, beginning last December, Kerr, 29, got her wish. She spent the majority of her nonworking time in Wellington , New Zealand\u2019s capital, where her husband, Orlando Bloom , was filming \u201cThe Hobbit,\u201d Peter Jackson \u2019s two-part prequel to the epic \u201cThe Lord of the Rings\u201d trilogy, the films that first made Bloom a star a decade ago. Wellington \u2014 or \u201cWellywood,\u201d as it\u2019s been christened since Jackson set up his studio empire in the suburb of Miramar \u2014 is one of the most remote capitals on the planet: some 28 hours by plane from London , 23 from New York, 15 from Los Angeles , 14 hours from Hong Kong and Tokyo . Of the city\u2019s many charms \u2014 its burgeoning restaurant scene, its absurdly picturesque scenery, the mellow Kiwi hospitality you experience everywhere you go \u2014 it is Wellington\u2019s physical isolation that makes it such a singular place. During the week I spent in the city, no matter what I was doing, even something as simple as sitting at a cafe sipping a flat white (New Zealand\u2019s richer version of a latte), I felt a palpable remove from the ways and rhythms of the rest of the world. (Being on the other side of the international date line helps.) So while much of Wellington could be compared to, say, Portland , Ore., or Seattle , there is the added seduction of being pleasantly unmoored, able to take in the pleasure of civilization while existing outside of it.\n\nThe circumstances of Kerr\u2019s stay in Wellington were, of course, quite different from her initial visit. She is now the mother of a cherubic young son, Flynn, 19 months, and the tent of her teen years was replaced by an airy, seaside mansion where every window looks out on Wellington Harbour. (The house, lent to the couple by one of the film\u2019s producers, happens to be where Bloom celebrated his 22nd birthday while filming \u201cTLOTR.\u201d) If she wanted to run an errand, or head to an afternoon Pilates class, a production assistant gave her a ride. Sweet perks, no question. And yet, to hear Kerr tell it, the life she and Bloom carved out in Wellington was in many ways a reminder of what existence was like before she became a celebrity, a kind of geographic escape hatch from the scrutiny of tabloids and the curious eyes of strangers. When they first arrived, for instance, they took a road trip that was reminiscent of her earlier journey: aimlessly driving around the countryside, out of reach and out of touch. \u201cWe didn\u2019t camp because Flynn\u2019s still a little young for that,\u201d Kerr told me. \u201cBut it was just the three of us, nothing to do except be with each other in this shockingly beautiful place.\u201d\n\nKerr and I were having this conversation at Wellington\u2019s Botanic Garden, a sprawling expanse of lush floral curiosities, manicured lawns and shaded labyrinthine walkways offering some of the most extraordinary views of the city. It was hard to imagine that this was the same woman who, a few months earlier, had walked the runway in a $2.5 million bra while Maroon 5 performed at the Victoria\u2019s Secret fashion show; here, in raw-denim jeans and a loose navy sweater, she seemed no different from the other health-conscious young mothers who made up most of the gardens \u2019 visitors. Kerr had come from the set of \u201cThe Hobbit,\u201d which she visited most days with Flynn when Bloom, who was reprising his role as the bow-wielding elf Legolas, was working. \u201cThere\u2019s a cafeteria where everyone eats lunch, and they\u2019re all in full makeup,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cSo you see these poor Orcs\u201d \u2014 the demonic goblin soldiers of the film \u2014 \u201ctrying to eat without ruining their costumes. For Orlando , it\u2019s easier. He just has the blond wig and the pointy ears.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story"}

Born Eric Maxwell Johnson on September 15, 1979, in Needham, Massachusetts, US, he played as a tight end in the National Football League. Athletically gifted Johnson first got the chance to flaunt his football skills on a wider scale at Yale, where he played as a wide receiver. He was the one to catch 21 receptions for 244 yards in Yale's come-from-behind victory against Harvard in 1999, including the game-winning touchdown catch. He turned pro after he was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers in the seventh round of the 2001 NFL Draft. When healthy, he was a big contributor to the 49ers passing game. But still, he did miss all of the 2003 and 2005seasons, due to injuries. He remained with the San Francisco 49ers until 2006, and he signed a one-year contract with the New Orleans Saints in 2007. The following year he got re-signed by the team, but the Saints released him for good on July 31, 2008. Two years after his retirement from the sport, the once-married former NFL player started dating singer Jessica Simpson. The couple announced their engagement few months later and they have now two children together: daughter Maxwell Drew Johnson and son Ace Knute Johnson."}

{"label": false, "txt": "Barbra Streisand speaks onstage during the 75th Annual Golden Globe Awards at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on Jan. 7, 2018 in Beverly Hills, Calif.\n\nBarbra Streisand took a trip down memory lane Friday night (March 16).\n\nThe Hollywood legend was presented with the Icon Tribute during the kickoff to the 35th annual PaleyFest LA at the Dolby Theater.\n\nRyan Murphy was on hand to a lead an in-depth conversation with Streisand about her life in television, which began in 1961 with an appearance on The Tonight Show.\n\n\u201cI have to look up everything about myself because I forget,\u201d Streisand said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember. I asked my assistant today, \u2018Did I win the Emmy for that? I don\u2019t remember that.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI usually remember things by the food or what I was wearing. Quincy [Jones] sent me a picture and there we are, 1963, at my first Grammys and I don\u2019t know where it was. At a hotel? A theater? I get things like that mixed up.\u201d\n\nStreisand admitted that she didn\u2019t realize the PaleyFest tribute would be on stage at the Dolby. \u201cI thought tonight was going to be at Beverly Hills at the Television Academy,\u201d she said to big laughs. \u201cI really thought that it was a dinner and we\u2019d be sitting around tables and it was a chat. I wasn\u2019t prepared for the Dolby Theatre.\u201d\n\nPrepared or not, Streisand had no trouble reminiscing about her many television projects, which have earned her five primetime Emmys.\n\nHere are some of the highlights of Friday night\u2019s almost hour-long chat with Murphy.\n\nShe was 21 when she appeared on Judy Garland\u2019s variety show. She recalled the 41-year-old Wizard of Oz\u2019s hands to be cold and shaking. \u201cI adored her,\u201d Streisand said. \u201cI loved her. She was so wonderful to me. But it was interesting to observe, that drinking to try to ease the tension of fear\u2026I know what she feels now because she was a legend. It gets harder as you get older.\u201d\n\nStreisand was struck with a paralyzing case of stage fright after she forgot the lyrics to one of her songs during her famous Central Park concert in 1968. She didn\u2019t perform publicly for another almost 30 years unless it was for a political cause or a charity fundraiser. Listening to a self-help tape called Excellence helped her overcome the fear of performing.\n\n\u201cEven today, I don\u2019t really like to talk before I go on,\u201d she said. \u201cI get very quiet. I also got a little pill called Inderoll. 10 milligrams. It did take away my pounding heart because when you have a pounding heart you can\u2019t sing. It effects your vocals.\"\n\nAs for calming her nerves with a glass of wine, Streisand said she doesn\u2019t drink. \u201cI liked rum-and-coke sometimes when I was a teenager,\u201d she said. \u201cI like that little buzz like beer. I like beer but I was never into wines.\u201d\n\nStreisand\u2019s longtime disdain for the press hasn\u2019t subsided. She doesn\u2019t understand why the press is surprised when she asks for photo approvals. \u201cYeah, I want f---ing photo approval,\u201d she said.\n\nShe makes no apologies for being a control-freak. \u201cI would say anybody talented\u2026wants to control their work,\u201d Streisand explained. \u201cIt\u2019s not controlling life. It\u2019s not controlling your life. It\u2019s controlling your work.\u201d\n\nStreisand also says she never experienced a #MeToo moment. \u201cI wasn\u2019t one of those pretty girls with those nice little noses,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019re in a strange time now with men and women and the pendulum is swinging this way and that way and it\u2019s going to have to come to the center.\u201d\n\nMost of Streisand\u2019s television watching these days is CNN and MSNBC. However, she enjoys watching Who Wants to be a Millionaire? while she\u2019s exercising. The latest season of Homeland has left her \u201cdisappointed\u201d and Murphy\u2019s American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace too \u201cscary.\u201d \u201cI like the parts with Penelope Cruz and Edgar Ramirez,\u201d she said.\n\nShe has seen parts of the upcoming remake of A Star is Born directed by and starring Bradley Copper opposite Lady Gaga. \u201cIt\u2019s very very good,\u201d Streisand said.\n\nThere was no mention of rumors that Streisand would guest star on Murphy\u2019s upcoming political drama on Netflix with Gwyneth Paltrow and Ben Platt. However, when Streisand said she doesn\u2019t like doing more than four takes when she\u2019s acting, Murphy said with a smile, \u201cNoted.\u201d When she talked about still wanting to star as Mama Rose in a Gypsy remake, Ryan offered, \u201cI have a really good Netflix deal, Barbra.\u201d\n\nThe evening ended with The Paley Center for Media president and CEO Maureen J. Reidy presenting the Icon award to Streisand. Anyone hoping to get a quick photo or word with Streisand was out of luck. As soon as she began to walk off stage, seven burly security guards appeared on stage to thwart any overzealous fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Hollywood Reporter."}

Robart wrote in his opinion that \u201cfundamental\u201d to the court\u2019s work was \u201ca vigilant recognition that it is but one of three equal branches of our federal government.\u201d\n\nRobart, a judge appointed by George W. Bush, said in his written order that U.S. officials should stop enforcing the key aspects of the ban: the halting of entry by citizens from certain countries and by refugees from around the world. He did not specifically address the matter of those whose visas already had been revoked.\n\nFollowing the Friday-night ruling, government authorities immediately began communicating with airlines and taking steps that would allow travel by those previously barred from doing so, according to a U.S. official.\n\nAt the same time, though, the White House said in a statement that the Justice Department would \u201cat the earliest possible time\u201d file for an emergency stay of the \u201coutrageous\u201d ruling from the judge.

The Department of Homeland Security said the ban would not apply to permanent residents or green-card holders, dual citizens who carry a passport from somewhere other than one of the banned countries and those with NATO or U.N. visas.\n\nRobart's ruling Friday, which was broader than similar ones before it, sets up a high-stakes legal confrontation between the new president and the judicial branch.\n\nThe ruling is temporary, and the ultimate question of whether Trump\u2019s executive order will pass constitutional muster will fall to higher-level courts. Legal analysts have said the ban could be difficult to permanently undo because the president has broad authority to set immigration policy.\n\nLater Saturday morning, the State Department announced it would reverse its visa revocations, allowing previously banned travelers to enter the United States.\n\nTrump, presumably responding to the latest development, resumed tweeting his displeasure hours later.\n\nWhat is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.? \u2014 Donald J.

We know all those details. You know what\u2019s much more fun to discuss than wedding logistics? Wedding drama.\n\nAnd unlike many royal weddings, there has been no shortage of it, especially in the last week. Here\u2019s all the gossip leading up to the year\u2019s most anticipated nuptials:\n\nWhat\u2019s up with Meghan\u2019s dad?\n\nThomas Markle Sr., 73, used to work as a TV lighting director and cinematographer and has since retired to Mexico. Much has been made of Meghan\u2019s relationship with her dad, as he and her mom divorced when Meghan was 6. Thomas has never met Harry, but they\u2019ve reportedly spoken by phone. An \u201cinsider\u201d recently told People magazine, \u201cLike any father-daughter relationship, there have been ups and downs over the years. But they are in a good place now.\u201d\n\nThen it gets confusing. In early May, Meghan\u2019s half-brother (more about him later) sent a nasty letter to Harry, imploring him not to marry Meghan and calling it \u201cthe biggest mistake in wedding history.\u201d The letter, obtained by In Touch magazine, claimed Meghan\u2019s father had not received an invitation to the wedding. However, the palace released a statement at the time confirming that Thomas would walk his daughter down the aisle. So that was weird.\n\nHowever, things fell apart this week when it was revealed that Thomas Sr. had been working with the paparazzi to stage photos of himself: Reading a book on Great Britain, getting fitted for a suit, etc. This did not go over well, as the palace had chastised the media for badgering him. On Monday, Thomas told TMZ that he regretted the photos, saying they were \u201cstupid and hammy,\u201d and said he would not be attending the wedding because of a recent heart attack. A day later, he changed his mind and said he would love to go. Then, he contacted TMZ once more to say that he had to undergo heart surgery on Wednesday, and he would officially not be attending.\n\nEarly in the week, the palace sidestepped commenting on this mess, as a spokesperson simply said, \u201cThis is a deeply personal moment for Ms. Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr. Markle in this difficult situation.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Markle finally weighed in: \u201cSadly, my father will not be attending our wedding. I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health. I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.\u201d\n\nAnd what\u2019s up with her half-sister?\n\nSamantha Markle, 53, is Thomas Sr.\u2019s daughter from his first marriage and lives in Florida with her three kids. She made headlines early in Meghan and Harry\u2019s relationship when it was reported she was penning a tell-all memoir called \u201cThe Diary of Princess Pushy\u2019s Sister.\u201d (The two reportedly haven\u2019t spoken in years.) Samantha also trashed her half-sister in interviews, calling her a \u201cshallow social climber\u201d only interested in fame. Later, she changed her tune, saying Meghan was \u201cabsolutely lovely.\u201d\n\nSo guess who wasn\u2019t invited to the wedding? Plus, Samantha admitted this week she was the one who persuaded their father to take those staged pictures, thinking it would help improve his image. This earned her a dressing-down from TV host Piers Morgan, who called her a \u201clittle vulture.\u201d\n\nWhy did Meghan\u2019s half-brother write such a cruel letter to Harry?\n\nIt\u2019s unclear \u2014 maybe Thomas Jr., 50 (Thomas Sr.\u2019s son from his first marriage) was upset that he was left off the wedding guest list? \u201cMeghan Markle is obviously not the right woman for you,\u201d he wrote to Harry, adding his half-sister was a \u201cjaded, shallow, conceited woman that will make a joke of you and the royal family heritage.\u201d Thomas Jr. later appeared to regret this, as he gave a follow-up letter to In Touch in which he begged Meghan for a wedding invitation, trying to guilt her with the line, \u201cWe are all still family.\u201d We\u2019re guessing that it did not work.\n\nHowever, Thomas Jr.\u2019s ex-wife, Tracy, and their sons, Tyler and Thomas, did not let that deter them \u2014 they recently landed in London, where they\u2019ll be acting as wedding correspondents for \u201cGood Morning Britain.\u201d\n\n\n\nMeghan Markle watches the closing ceremonies of the Invictus Games with her mother, Doria Ragland, in Toronto last year. (Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press/AP)\n\nWhat about her mom?\n\n\n\nDoria Ragland, 61, is a yoga instructor and social worker. Meghan is her only child, and they\u2019re extremely close. Before the engagement, she met Harry, who proclaimed her \u201camazing.\u201d Tabloids reported that Doria, who lives in Los Angeles, recently quit her job at a mental health clinic. (Hmmm, could she be moving out of the country sometime in the future?) It has been speculated that Doria could walk her daughter down the aisle. (Update: Prince Charles is actually going to do it.) Either way, she arrived in London earlier this week to spend time with Meghan and meet the royal family.\n\nIs her ex-husband really producing a TV show based on their relationship?\n\nMeghan married film producer Trevor Engelson in 2011; they split two years later. In September 2017, Deadline reported that Engelson was shopping a fictional TV comedy with the description: \u201cDivorce is hard. Sharing custody is harder. Sharing custody with the British Royal family when your wife marries a prince, in the unforgiving spotlight of London\u2019s tabloid media, is next level.\u201d Hmmm. The idea was apparently sparked when Engelson and another producer were talking about what could have happened if he and Meghan had kids.\n\nHowever, the Sun recently reported that Engelson, after being persuaded by Meghan and some mutual friends, has put the project on hold \u2014 for now.\n\nIs there any drama on Harry\u2019s side of the family?\n\nHave you seen \u201cThe Crown\u201d? You have? Good. That\u2019s probably all the intense Windsor drama you\u2019re going to get. Because Harry and Meghan limited the size of their guest list \u2014 it still includes 600 people, so everyone can chill \u2014 some distant relatives who were invited to William\u2019s wedding were not invited to Harry\u2019s. The royals are trained in remaining tight-lipped about most drama, of course, so we don\u2019t know whether these minor snubs have caused any problems.\n\nWhat\u2019s up with those rumors about Meghan and Kate feuding?\n\nMeghan\u2019s eloquence and openness have earned her comparisons to Harry\u2019s late mother, Princess Diana, often called the \u201cPeople\u2019s Princess.\u201d Several tabloids report Kate is jealous of this comparison and Meghan\u2019s overall popularity with the family and public.\n\nBut some rumors are simply rumors, friends, as Meghan and Kate have shown no signs of fighting \u2014 in public, at least. They both attended a Royal Foundation event with their significant others in February, during which the foursome were asked whether they ever disagree.\n\nWilliam replied, \u201cOhhh, yes,\u201d according to Vanity Fair. Harry elaborated: \u201cI think it\u2019s really good we have got four different personalities and we all have that same passion to make a difference. We have different opinions and they work really well [together].\u201d He then noted that they are all \u201cstuck together for the rest of our lives,\u201d to which Meghan added, \u201cTogetherness at its finest.\u201d\n\n\n\nPrince Harry, Meghan Markle and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, attend the first annual Royal Foundation Forum. (Chris Jackson/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nWhat roles will William and Kate have in the wedding?\n\nA few months after William said his younger brother had not yet asked him to be his best man \u2014 \u201cIt could be a sensitive subject,\u201d he joked on a radio show \u2014 Kensington Palace announced that William would, in fact, return the favor that Harry did for him in 2011. Kate probably won\u2019t have a formal role during the ceremony, according to a Vanity Fair source who said Meghan and Harry \u201cjust want Kate to be able to enjoy the day and not worry about anything.\u201d William and Kate\u2019s older children, George and Charlotte, will be in the wedding party, while young Louis will stay at home.\n\n[Little royals George and Charlotte threaten to upstage everyone else at Uncle Harry\u2019s wedding]\n\nAre Harry\u2019s exes invited to the wedding?\n\nProbably! Harry is said to be on good terms with Cressida Bonas, whom he dated for two years, and Chelsy Davy, whom he dated on-and-off for seven. There\u2019s also precedent: Several of William\u2019s exes attended his wedding, and Prince Charles\u2019s then-ex-girlfriend \u2014 now his wife, Duchess Camilla \u2014 attended his to Diana.\n\nWhich celebrities will be there?\n\nNever forget that before she ascended to royalty, Meghan was a mere Hollywood celebrity. Several actors from \u201cSuits,\u201d the USA network legal drama that propelled her to fame, are expected to attend the ceremony: Gabriel Macht, Patrick J. Adams, Sarah Rafferty, Gina Torres and Rick Hoffman. All five Spice Girls \u2014 British royalty in their own right \u2014 likely will, too, along with Meghan\u2019s pals Priyanka Chopra and Serena Williams.

I think it's so important and I spent so much time making sure that everything that I do, I do for myself. So as much as that has been inspiring because I love to be inspired by people that I do love and care about, but I'm a big advocate on making sure that I'm doing it for me. Because the moment I start doing something because I'm influenced by someone else, whoever it may be, it just doesn't work out so believe it or not, I keep that very, very separate, which is good.\"\n\nOn June 6th, Gomez and Tesfaye have a well-documented date night at Rao's restaurant in East Harlem.

It's great,\" she started. \"[But] I don't depend on one area of my life to make me happy. It's really important for me to love and nourish my friends and family and to make sure that I never get influenced by a guy. I've wanted to be in a strong headspace for years, and I really wasn't. Before, I was so young and easily influenced, and I'd feel insecure. You want someone to add to your life, not to complete you, if that makes sense.

For what? Society? Who gets to decide what is appropriate and fashionable? I wear what I like and no one should fault me for that. I don\u2019t want people to constantly see me in the news for going to dinner, or grocery shopping, or anything. I want to be in the news when I ASK for it by going to a publicized event.

{"label": false, "txt": "Jul 26, 2015; Toronto, Ontario, CAN; Recording artist Kanye West performs during the closing ceremony for the 2015 Pan Am Games at Pan Am Ceremonies Venue. Mandatory Credit: Jeff Swinger-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe Moment Dave Chappelle, Talib Kwali and Common Knew Kanye West Would Be Famous by Ryan Brennan\n\nReports are saying that Kanye West is so paranoid that he wears a bulletproof vest everywhere. I don\u2019t buy it one bit.\n\nIf so, then Kanye West is a lot skinnier than I thought he was.\n\nThe report I am talking about comes from the National Enquirer, which stated that Kanye West is \u201cso paranoid he is going to be assassinated he\u2019s made a bulletproof vest part of his everyday attire.\u201d I wasn\u2019t buying it the second I saw it, mostly because their source was cited as a \u201csnitch.\u201d\n\nAccording to this \u2018snitch,\u2019 Yeezus fears that his wealth has made him, his wife Kim Kardashian and his children susceptible to people that mean harm. As evidence, he now wears a bulletproof vest anytime he leaves the house.\n\nWhen he married Kim Kardashian and had two children with her, he created quite the household. It\u2019s a household that gets a crazy amount of attention and doesn\u2019t get much privacy. With Kanye\u2019s recent nervous breakdown, it\u2019s understandable to assume he might be paranoid of bad things happening to his family.\n\nBut a bulletproof vest everytime he leaves the house? I don\u2019t buy it all.\n\nFirst off, Kanye West can\u2019t leave the house without a photo of him being taken \u2014 whether it\u2019s the media or one of Kim K\u2019s selfies. With that being said, don\u2019t you think people would\u2019ve noticed him wearing a bulletproof vest \u2014 and asked why he\u2019s wearing one.\n\nA random report that says he does it everyday isn\u2019t exactly believable when we see pictures of him.. everyday. Keep in mind, the report said \u2014 word for word \u2014 that he \u201cwears the bulky gear even when it\u2019s just out for dinner.\u201d\n\nIn addition to that, the report suggests that he is \u201ctortured\u201d by thoughts of what happened to Kim in Paris last October \u2014 the robbery. If you don\u2019t know Kanye West, he\u2019s a family person. He loves his family, loves his wife and loves his children. With that being said, why would he only put a bulletproof vest on himself?\n\nIf he was that paranoid, we would see Kim Kardashian wearing a bulletproof vest out to dinner, too. As well as the children.\n\nWhen I see photos of Kanye, Kim, North and Saint, I see no bulletproof vests.\n\nObviously, these reports of Kanye wearing a bulletproof vest are not true and are aimed to hurt his image. In fact, the only people really targeting Kanye and his family are media outlets like National Enquirer and others that have picked up the story as true.\n\nLet\u2019s just take one last look at a quote from this so-called \u2018snitch,\u2019 according to National Enquirer:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fearful of being followed \u2014 but it\u2019s really all in his mind.

His social media posts blasted Chyna for allegedly cheating on him in his bed. He also shared nude pictures of her and revealed that he had paid for her weight loss surgery after her pregnancy. Rob\u2019s Instagram account was eventually suspended because of his posts, but then he continued his tirade on Twitter.\n\nIn response, Chyna posted a now deleted Snapchat where she accused Rob of abusing her physically.\n\nAs Gossip Cop reported, one of Chyna\u2019s other attorneys, Walter Mosley, made a statement on her behalf soon after Kardashian\u2019s tantrum cooled down.\n\nI represent Blac Chyna.

Friends are worried the 25-year-old is on a downward spiral and actually \u201cis a mess,\u201d a source tells OK! Magazine.\n\nEven prior to her breakup, Selena\u2019s been very open about struggles she faces, including depression and anxiety, and goes to therapy on a regular basis to work on her battles.\n\nAnd the split, which of course happened in front of the world, didn\u2019t help matters. Says the insider, \u201cShe went from being on top of the world to dealing with nonstop relationship drama. She feels so demoralized and alone.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, because her mother Mandy doesn\u2019t particularly like Justin, Selena reportedly chose to end things because she could not take the burden of having her mom at odds with her.\n\nUnfortunately, that choice backfired. The source added, \u201cSelena now feels a lot of resentment toward Mandy about the decision she made, and they\u2019re barely speaking. So she\u2019s essentially lost the two main influences in her life, which could be a recipe for disaster.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Selena\u2019s spiral? Let us know in the comments section."}

{"label": false, "txt": "Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth are still very much an item, despite a recent report speculating that the couple had broken up . But don't expect them to make any grand public appearances soon. Instead, the pair are going to be laying low for a while so they can have as much privacy as possible. Which means you might not see any cute couple antics on Instagram stories for a while.\n\nAccording to the latest update on their relationship, Cyrus and Hemsworth are \"very much still together and have just been trying to be more private about their relationship,\" a source told E! News, adding, \"They have been spending a lot of their time being low-key in Nashville lately, and come home to Malibu often to spend time with family.\"\n\nAs it turns out, the reason Cyrus deleted all her Instagram posts\u2014including ones with Hemsworth\u2014is that she's shifting how she presents herself to the world in anticipation of her next album, the followup to 2015's Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz and 2017's Younger Now . \"Miley is working on new music and rebranding herself, hence why she deleted her Instagram photos,\" the source says, \"She is starting the process of a new music project and wants a clean slate.\"\n\nThat clean slate may also include wedding plans, although as of now no date has been set. \"Wedding planning has been a continuous conversation over the years but they have not locked in any set plans,\" the source says. \"Their family would love for them to finally tie the knot, and are very excited about it, but no one is pushing them. Miley is very simplistic when it comes to her ideas and does not want things to be an ordeal. Both Miley and Liam want to have children and they both want to be married but aren't trying to rush the process.\"\n\nThe last time Cyrus opened up about marriage, though, she said it wasn't something she was necessarily interested in. \"I'm just riding this out,\" she said last fall. \"I don\u2019t envision marriage. I\u2019m 24. I hope I get to live a little bit more. I have too much living to do.\" This time, however, she'll be doing much of that living behind closed doors.\n\nRelated: Miley Cyrus Says Playing Hannah Montana Did \"Extreme Damage in My Psyche\""}

{"label": false, "txt": "Over the course of their 12-year relationship, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie engaged in 'heated, screaming fights' about how to raise their six children, a source reveals to Us Weekly.\n\nFor years, the parents of Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and 8-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne, shuttled between their 1,000-acre estate, Ch\u00e2teau Miraval, in France; a compound in L.A.\u2019s Los Feliz neighborhood; a mansion in New Orleans\u2019 French Quarter; a New York City penthouse; and wherever the actors happened to be working. As Jolie explained to NBC News in 2011, \u201cI\u2019m trying to raise [the children] to \u2026 really live a truly global [life].\"\n\nPitt, 52, grew to resent the peripatetic existence. As far back as 2009, a source told Us at the time, Pitt wanted to enroll the kids in one school in New Orleans, while Jolie preferred homeschooling to allow them to continue their travels. \u201cBrad wants them to have a normal upbringing and worries that they\u2019ll come out spoiled, elitist and not grounded,\u201d the source said at the time. \u201cBut Angie feels they should be \u2018children of the world.\u2019 They argue about it all the time: heated, screaming fights.\u201d\n\nIn a 2012 interview, the Oscar-winner, 41, acknowledged Pitt was the tougher parent of the two. \"Brad's had to play bad cop more often,\" she said. But according to a Jolie friend, Pitt was too strict for his wife's liking. \"[He] became a big yeller,\u201d claims the source. \u201cAnd she would not tolerate him yelling at the kids. There were a few times Angie said she was terrified.\u201d\n\nThe War Machine actor, raised in a conservative household in Springfield, Missouri, was stern but never abusive, says a source who has worked with the family. \"When he raises his voice and yells at the kids, it's almost comical,\" says the source. \"He's not one of those guys with a temper. He's not a drill sergeant.\"\n\nAt the skate park he had installed at the Los Feliz home, Pitt would often play with the kids. But if the youngsters didn\u2019t put away their scooters and bicycles, \u201che\u2019d go, \u2018You clean up your bikes!\u2019\u201d relates the source. \u201cRegular fatherly things. He might say, \u2018How come nobody did this?\u2019 or \u2018Why didn\u2019t this get done?\u2019\u201d\n\nPitt was also a stickler when it came to bedtimes. Says the source, \"He might get upset if the kids stay up too late playing video games.\" Structure and order, adds another Pitt source, were important to him: \"Brad teaches them to be respectful human beings. Angelina lets the kids run around and behave badly.\"\n\nThe disagreements ultimately doomed the couple. Jolie filed for divorce on September 19 and requested full physical custody of the children. Their split, admits a Pitt source, \"came down to differences in lifestyle and parenting.\"\n\nFor much more on Jolie and Pitt's bitter split, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now.\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?

{"label": false, "txt": "Emily Jean Stone (born November 6, 1988) is an American actress. The recipient of such accolades as an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, and a Golden Globe, she was the highest-paid actress in the world in 2017. She appeared in Forbes Celebrity 100 in 2013 and the Time 100 in 2017, and has been cited in the media as one of the most talented actresses of her generation.\n\nBorn and raised in Scottsdale, Arizona, Stone began acting as a child, in a theater production of The Wind in the Willows in 2000. As a teenager, she relocated to Los Angeles with her mother, and made her television debut in In Search of the New Partridge Family (2004), a reality show that produced only an unsold pilot. After small television roles, she made her film debut in Superbad (2007), and received positive media attention for her role in Zombieland (2009). The 2010 teen comedy Easy A was Stone's first starring role, earning her nominations for the BAFTA Rising Star Award and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress. This breakthrough was followed with further success in the romantic comedy Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011) and the drama The Help (2011).\n\nStone gained wider recognition for playing Gwen Stacy in the 2012 superhero film The Amazing Spider-Man, and its sequel in 2014. She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for the role of a recovering drug addict in the black comedy-drama Birdman (2014). Her Broadway debut came in a revival of the musical Cabaret (2014\u20132015). Stone won an Academy Award for Best Actress for playing an aspiring actress in the highly successful musical film La La Land (2016), following which she portrayed Billie Jean King in the biographical sports film Battle of the Sexes (2017).\n\nEarly life\n\nEmily Jean Stone was born on November 6, 1988, in Scottsdale, Arizona, to Krista Jean Stone (n\u00e9e Yeager), a homemaker, and Jeffrey Charles Stone, the founder and CEO of a general-contracting company.[1][2] Stone lived on the grounds of the Camelback Inn resort from the age of 12 to 15.[3][4] She has a younger brother, Spencer.[5] Her paternal grandfather, Conrad Ostberg Sten, was from a Swedish family that anglicized their surname to \"Stone\" when they immigrated to the United States through Ellis Island. She also has German, English, Scottish, and Irish ancestry.[6]\n\nAs an infant, Stone had baby colic and cried frequently; she consequently developed nodules and calluses on her vocal cords while she was a child.[7] Stone has described herself as having been \"loud\" and \"bossy\" while growing up.[8] She was educated at Sequoya Elementary School and attended Cocopah Middle School for the sixth grade. Although she did not like school, she has stated that her controlling nature meant that \"I made sure I got all As\".[9] Stone suffered panic attacks as a child,[10] which she says caused a decline in her social skills.[11] She underwent therapy but states that it was her participation in local theater plays that helped cure the attacks.[10]\n\nThe first time I had a panic attack I was sitting in my friend's house, and I thought the house was burning down. I called my mom and she brought me home, and for the next three years it just would not stop. I would go to the nurse at lunch most days and just wring my hands. I would ask my mom to tell me exactly how the day was going to be, then ask again 30 seconds later. I just needed to know that no one was going to die and nothing was going to change. Stone, The Wall Street Journal, June 2015[10]\n\nStone started acting at age four;[4] she wanted a career in sketch comedy initially, but shifted her focus toward musical theater, and took voice lessons for several years.[12] Her acting debut, at the age of 11, came in a stage production of The Wind in the Willows, playing the part of Otter.[13] The actress was homeschooled for two years, during which time she appeared in sixteen productions at Phoenix's Valley Youth Theatre\u2014including The Princess and the Pea, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat[1]\u2014and performed with the theater's improvisational comedy troupe.[14] Around this time, she traveled to Los Angeles and auditioned unsuccessfully for a role in Nickelodeon's All That.[15] Her parents later sent her for private acting lessons with a local acting coach, who had worked at the William Morris Agency in the 1970s.[2]\n\nStone attended Xavier College Preparatory\u200d\u2014\u200can all-girl Catholic high school\u200d\u2014\u200cas a freshman, but dropped out after one semester to become an actress.[1] She prepared a PowerPoint presentation for her parents titled \"Project Hollywood\" (featuring Madonna's 2003 song \"Hollywood\") to convince them to let her move to California to pursue an acting career.[12] In January 2004, she moved with her mother to an apartment in Los Angeles. She recalls: \"I went up for every single show on the Disney Channel and auditioned to play the daughter on every single sitcom\", adding, \"I ended up getting none.\"[4] Between auditions for roles, she enrolled in online high-school classes, and worked part-time at a dog-treat bakery.[2][10]\n\nCareer\n\nEarly career (2004\u20132008)\n\nWhen Stone registered for the Screen Actors Guild, the name \"Emily Stone\" was already taken. \"Riley Stone\" was the stage name she chose initially, but after guest-starring in the NBC drama Medium and the Fox sitcom Malcolm in the Middle, she decided that she was more comfortable with \"Emma\".[15][16] She made her television debut as Laurie Partridge on the VH1 talent competition reality show In Search of the New Partridge Family (2004). The resulting show, retitled The New Partridge Family (2004), remained an unsold pilot.[17] She followed this with a guest appearance in Louis C.K.'s HBO series Lucky Louie.[10] She auditioned to star as Claire Bennet in the NBC science fiction drama Heroes (2007) but was unsuccessful and later called this her \"rock bottom\" experience.[2] In April 2007, she played Violet Trimble in the Fox action drama Drive, but the show was canceled after seven episodes.[1]\n\nStone made her feature film debut in Greg Mottola's comedy Superbad (2007), co-starring Michael Cera and Jonah Hill. The film tells the story of two high school students who go through a series of comic misadventures after they plan to buy alcohol for a party. To play the role of Hill's romantic interest, she dyed her hair red.[18] A reviewer for The Hollywood Reporter found her \"appealing\", but felt that her role was poorly written.[19] Stone has described the experience of acting in her first film as \"amazing ... [but] very different than other experiences I've had since then\".[20] The film was a commercial success, and earned her the Young Hollywood Award for Exciting New Face.[21][22]\n\nThe following year, Stone starred in the comedy The Rocker (2008) playing Amelia Stone, the \"straight face\" bass guitarist in a band; she learned to play the bass for the role.[23] The actress, who describes herself as \"a big smiler and laugher\", has admitted that she found it difficult portraying a character whose personality traits were so different from her own. The film, and her performance, received negative reviews from critics and was a commercial failure.[24][25] Her next release, the romantic comedy The House Bunny, performed better at the box-office, becoming a moderate commercial success.[26] The film sees her play the president of a sorority, and perform a cover version of the Waitresses' 1982 song \"I Know What Boys Like\".[27] Reviews for the film were generally negative,[28] though she was praised for her supporting role,[29] and TV Guide's Ken Fox wrote of Stone that: \"She's positively incandescent, lighting up a movie that would be pretty dim without her.\"[30]\n\nBreakthrough (2009\u20132011)\n\nZombieland world premiere in 2009 Stone at theworld premiere in 2009\n\nStone appeared in three films released in 2009. The first of these was opposite Matthew McConaughey, Jennifer Garner and Michael Douglas in Mark Waters' Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. Loosely based on Charles Dickens' 1843 novella A Christmas Carol, the romantic comedy has her playing a ghost who haunts her former boyfriend. Critical reaction to the film was negative, though it was a modest commercial success.[31][32] Her most financially profitable venture that year was Ruben Fleischer's $102.3 million-grossing horror comedy film Zombieland,[33] in which she features alongside Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson and Abigail Breslin. In the film, she appeared as a con artist and survivor of a zombie apocalypse, in a role which Empire's Chris Hewitt found to be \"somewhat underwritten\".[34] In a more positive review, the critic for The Daily Telegraph wrote: \"[T]he hugely promising Stone ... [is] a tough cookie who projects the aura of being wiser than her years.\"[35] Stone's final release in 2009 was Kieran and Michelle Mulroney's Paper Man, a comedy-drama which disappointed critics.[36]\n\nStone provided the voice of an Australian Shepherd in Marmaduke (2010), a comedy from director Tom Dey, which is based on Brad Anderson's long-running comic strip of the same name.[37] Her breakthrough came the same year with a starring role in Easy A, a teen comedy directed by Will Gluck.[38][39] Partially based on Nathaniel Hawthorne's 1850 historical romance novel The Scarlet Letter, the film tells the story of Olive Penderghast (Stone), a high school student who becomes embroiled in a comic sex scandal after a false rumor circulates that she is sexually promiscuous. Stone read the script before the project was optioned for production, and pursued it with her manager while production details were being finalized. She found the script \"so different and unique from anything I'd read before\", saying that it was \"funny and sweet\". When Stone discovered that the film had begun production, she met with Gluck, expressing her enthusiasm for the project. A few months later, the audition process started and she met again with Gluck, becoming one of the first actresses to audition.[40] The film received positive critical reviews, and Stone's performance was considered its prime asset.[41] Anna Smith of Time Out commented: \"Stone gives a terrific performance, her knowing drawl implying intellect and indifference with underlying warmth.\"[42] With a total box office of $75 million, the film was a commercial success.[43] Stone was nominated for a BAFTA Rising Star Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy, and won the MTV Movie Award for Best Comedic Performance.[44]\n\nIn October 2010, Stone hosted an episode of NBC's late-night sketch comedy Saturday Night Live; her appearances included a sketch playing off her resemblance to Lindsay Lohan.[45] Stone described it as \"the greatest week of my life\".[4][46] She hosted it again in 2011, appeared in an episode in 2014, and in its 40th anniversary special in 2015.[47] A brief appearance in the sex comedy Friends with Benefits (2011) reunited her with Gluck.[48] She followed this with a supporting role in Glenn Ficarra and John Requa's romantic comedy Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011) alongside Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling and Julianne Moore. The film features her as a law school graduate, and the love interest of Gosling's character. Despite finding \"some inevitable collapses into convention\" in the film, Drew McWeeny of HitFix wrote that Stone \"ties the whole film together\".[49] At the 2012 Teen Choice Awards, she won the Choice Movie Actress \u2013 Comedy award for her performance in the film.[50] Crazy, Stupid, Love was a box office success, grossing $142.9 million worldwide with a production budget of $50 million.[51]\n\nDisillusioned at being typecast as the \"sarcastic interest of the guy\", Stone co-starred with Viola Davis in Tate Taylor's period drama The Help (2011), a film she found to be challenging.[52] The film is based on Kathryn Stockett's 2009 novel of the same name and is set in 1960s Jackson, Mississippi. She met with Taylor to express a desire to work in the film. Taylor has said: \"Emma was completely awkward and dorky, with her raspy voice, and she sat down and we got a little intoxicated and had a blast, and I just thought, 'God! God! This is Skeeter.\"[53] She was cast as Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan, an aspiring writer learning about the lives of the African-American maids. In preparation for the part, she trained to speak in a Southern dialect; she also educated herself on the Civil Rights Movement through literature and film.[54] With a worldwide gross of $216 million against a budget of $25 million, The Help became Stone's most commercially successful film to that point.[55] The film, and her performance, received positive reviews from critics.[56] Writing for Empire, Anna Smith thought that Stone was \"well-meaning and hugely likable\" despite finding flaws in the character.[57] The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture,[58] and won Best Ensemble Cast from the Women Film Critics Circle and the Broadcast Film Critics Association.[59][60]\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man, Birdman, and Broadway (2012\u20132015)\n\nStone declined a role in the action comedy film 21 Jump Street after signing on to Marc Webb's 2012 film The Amazing Spider-Man, a reboot of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man series.[61][62] She portrayed Gwen Stacy, the love interest of the title character (played by Andrew Garfield).[63] Stone returned to a blond hair color for the role, having dyed it red previously.[64][65] She told The Vancouver Sun that she felt responsible to educate herself about Spider-Man and admitted that she had not read the comics: \"My experience was with the Sam Raimi movies ... I always assumed that Mary Jane was his first love\",[66] adding that she was only familiar with Stacy's character from Bryce Dallas Howard's portrayal in Spider-Man 3.[67][68] The Amazing Spider-Man was a commercial success and was the seventh highest-grossing film of 2012 with global revenues of $757.9 million.[69] Entertainment Weekly's Lisa Schwarzbaum found Stone \"irresistible\",[70] and Ian Freer of Empire magazine was particularly impressed with Stone's and Garfield's performances.[71] At the annual People's Choice Awards ceremony, she was nominated for three awards, including Favorite Movie Actress.[72] Later that year, Stone voiced a role in the crime-based video game, Sleeping Dogs, which earned her a Spike Video Game Award for Best Performance by a Human Female nomination.[73]\n\nStone began 2013 with a voice role in DreamWorks' The Croods, an animated feature nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.[74] This followed with an appearance in Movie 43, an anthology film which consists of sixteen short stories\u2014she played the title role in the segment entitled \"Veronica\".[75] The actress collaborated with Ryan Gosling and Sean Penn in Ruben Fleischer's Gangster Squad (2013), a crime thriller set in Los Angeles during the 1940s.[76] The New York Times' A. O. Scott dismissed the film as \"a hectic jumble of fedoras and zoot suits\", but praised her pairing with Gosling.[77] Stone expressed a desire to work with Gosling on more projects.[78]\n\nStone at WonderCon in 2012\n\nIn 2014, Stone reprised the role of Gwen Stacy in The Amazing Spider-Man 2. In an interview with Total Film, the actress explained that her character was not dependent on the film's protagonist. \"She saves him more than he saves her. She's incredibly helpful to Spider-Man ... He's the muscle, she's the brains.\"[79] Her performance was well received by critics;[80] an Empire reviewer praised her for standing out in the film: \"Stone is the Heath Ledger of this series, doing something unexpected with an easily dismissed supporting character.\"[81] The role earned her the Favorite Movie Actress award at the 2015 Kids' Choice Awards.[82] Later that year, Stone took on a role in Woody Allen's romantic comedy Magic in the Moonlight, a modest commercial success.[83] A. O. Scott criticized her role, and pairing with Colin Firth, describing it as \"the kind of pedantic nonsense that is meant to signify superior intellect\".[84]\n\nThe black comedy-drama Birdman, from director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, was Stone's final film release in 2014. Co-starring Michael Keaton and Edward Norton, the film features her in the role of Sam Thomson, the recovering-addict daughter of actor Riggan Thomson (Keaton), who becomes his assistant. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu created the character based on his experience with his daughter.[85] Birdman was critically acclaimed,[86] and was the most successful film at the 87th Academy Awards; it was nominated for nine awards, winning four, including Best Picture.[87] The Movie Network considered it one of Stone's best performances to date and Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph was impressed with a monologue she delivers, which he thought was \"like a knitting needle to the gut\".[88][89] She received numerous accolades for her portrayal, including nominations for an Academy, a BAFTA, a Golden Globe, a Screen Actors Guild, and a Critics' Choice Movie award for Best Supporting Actress.[90]\n\nFrom November 2014 to February 2015, Stone starred in a revival of the Broadway musical Cabaret as Sally Bowles, taking over the role from Michelle Williams.[91] Considering it to be \"the most nerve-racking thing ever\", Stone told the Entertainment Weekly magazine that she listened to a French radio station to mentally prepare herself for the role.[92][93] Variety's Marilyn Stasio was critical of her singing and found her performance \"a bit narrow as an emotional platform, but a smart choice for her acting skills, the perfect fit for her sharp intelligence and kinetic energy.\"[94] Both of Stone's 2015 films\u200d\u2014\u200cthe romantic comedy-drama Aloha, and the mystery drama Irrational Man\u200d\u2014\u200cwere critical and commercial failures, and her roles were panned by critics.[83][95] In Cameron Crowe's Aloha, she took on the role of an Asian-American air force pilot alongside Bradley Cooper, and in the Woody Allen-directed Irrational Man, she portrayed the romantic interest of Joaquin Phoenix's character, a philosophy professor. The former was controversial for whitewashing the cast; Stone later regretted the project, acknowledging whitewashing as a widespread problem in Hollywood.[96] Despite the criticism, she was nominated for Choice Movie Actress \u2013 Comedy at the 2015 Teen Choice Awards.[97]\n\nLa La Land and beyond (2016\u2013present)\n\nDuring her Cabaret show, Stone met director Damien Chazelle, who, impressed with her performance, cast her in his musical comedy-drama La La Land.[98] The project, which marked her third collaboration with Gosling, featured Stone as Mia Dolan, an aspiring actress living in Los Angeles.[99] Stone borrowed several real-life experiences for her character, and in preparation, watched The Umbrellas of Cherbourg and films of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.[100][101] For the musical's soundtrack, she recorded six songs.[a] La La Land served as the opening film at the 2016 Venice Film Festival, and received highly positive reviews.[103] Besides being Stone's highest-rated film on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes,[104] the film was successful at the box office, earning over $440 million against its $30 million budget.[105] Writing for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw reviewed, \"Stone has never been better: superbly smart, witty, vulnerable, her huge doe eyes radiating intelligence even, or especially, when they are filling with tears.\"[106] Stone received an Academy, BAFTA, Golden Globe and a SAG award for Best Actress.[107]\n\nStone's sole film release of 2017 was the sports drama Battle of the Sexes, based on the 1973 eponymous match between tennis players Billie Jean King (Stone) and Bobby Riggs (Steve Carell).[108] In preparation, Stone met with King, watched old footage and interviews of her, trained with a dialect coach to speak in King's accent, and drank high-calorie protein shakes to gain 15 pounds (6.8 kg).[109][110] The film premiered to positive reviews at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, and certain critics considered Stone's performance to be the best of her career.[111] Benjamin Lee of The Guardian praised her for playing against type, and credited her for being \"strong\" and \"convincing\" in the part.[112] Even so, the film earned less than its $25 million budget.[113][114] Stone received her fourth Golden Globe nomination for it, and attended the ceremony with King.[115][116]\n\nIn September 2018, Stone will feature in and serve as an executive producer for the Netflix fantasy series Maniac, co-starring Jonah Hill and directed by Cary Fukunaga.[117] She will then star as Abigail Masham, who served under Queen Anne, in Yorgos Lanthimos' historical drama The Favourite.[118] Stone is also set to appear in the drama Love May Fail, based on Matthew Quick's 2015 novel and will portray Cruella de Vil in a live-action spin-off of One Hundred and One Dalmatians.[119][120] In addition, Stone has committed to star in a sequel to Zombieland.[121]\n\nPersonal life\n\nStone moved from Los Angeles to Greenwich Village, New York City, in 2009.[12] In 2016, she moved back to Los Angeles.[10] Despite frequent media coverage, the actress has refused to speak about her private life. Concerned with living a \"normal\" life, she has said that she finds little value in media attention.[122] She has expressed her fondness for her profession,[10] and has cited actress Diane Keaton as an influence, who is (in Stone's words) \"one of the most covered-up actresses of all time\". She has also named actress and singer-songwriter Marion Cotillard as one of her inspirations.[2]\n\nStone has a close relationship with her family.[2] She says: \"I am blessed with a great family and great people around me that would be able to kick me in the shins if I ever for one minute got lost up in the clouds. I've been really lucky in that sense.\"[123] During the production of The Amazing Spider-Man in 2010, Stone dated co-star Andrew Garfield.[124] The nature of their relationship was well-documented by the media, with frequent speculation about an impending engagement or a break-up.

{"label": false, "txt": "Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall rang in her 70th birthday on July 17, so what better time to look at one of the most important relationships in her life? The connection that she has with her two high-profile stepsons, Prince William and Prince Harry, is one that has evolved from some very dark times into something that those around them likely doubted they would ever see. By the time William and Harry were born, their father, Prince Charles, had not only long ago ended his relationship with Camilla, but he didn't see her socially as a friend, either. Charles and Camilla had been romantically involved in their early 20s, but Charles's naval career took him away to sea, and he ended the relationship. Camilla married her ex-boyfriend Andrew Parker-Bowles, and Charles wrote to his godfather, \"I suppose the feeling of emptiness will pass eventually.\"\n\nThe pair initially remained friends and lived near each other. The Parker-Bowles were regular visitors to Charles's country home Highgrove, and Charles was made godfather to their son Tom. When Charles and Diana got engaged, he stopped seeing Camilla socially, and so William and Harry never met her as young boys \u2014 but they certainly heard about her. When Charles and Diana's marriage broke down and they both sought affection elsewhere, Diana made her feelings about Camilla clear to her sons and so followed years of William and Harry's anger toward the woman Diana called \"Charles's lady.\"\n\nCharles and Diana separated in 1992, and after five years, he made moves to introduce his sons to the woman he hoped would one day be his wife. In the Summer of 1997, Charles sat down with William and Harry, explained a little about their relationship, and broached the subject of them all meeting \u2014 but William especially was resistant, and Charles knew it would be best to leave it for the time being.\n\n\"Diana made her feelings about Camilla clear to her sons and so followed years of William and Harry's anger towards the woman Diana called 'Charles's lady.'\n\nDiana died two months later, which naturally meant for Charles that it was all about supporting his sons. Over the next year, Charles and Camilla kept their relationship low-key; it was easier to work on building the relationship between Camilla and the queen.\n\nOver time, the princes could see that Camilla made their father happy. At the age of 16, William took charge of the inevitable and finally instigated a meeting in June 1998 at the London residence he and Harry lived at with their father, York House at St James's Palace. They spoke on their own for half an hour, and it was reported that it went well, but that afterward, Camilla came out and said \"I need a drink.\" They went on to meet for lunch and afternoon tea soon after and continued getting to know each other. Harry's first meeting with Camilla was more straightforward and came a couple of weeks later, over tea at Highgrove along with her children, Tom and Laura.\n\nOver the next seven years, the relationship between Camilla, William, and Harry was built very slowly. When the boys organized a 50th birthday party for Charles in November 1998, they invited Camilla to sit with Charles, although their relationship at that point was still very tentative. Camilla started to stay over at York House when William and Harry were in town, but when they were all at Highgrove together, she would drive back to her own house nearby after dinner, out of respect for the fact that it used to be Diana's house, too.\n\nBy the time Charles and Camilla married in 2005, things were significantly better between the two boys and Camilla. Shortly afterward, Harry said in an interview, \"She's a wonderful woman, and she's made our father very, very happy, which is the most important thing. William and I love her to bits.\" A further 12 years on from the wedding, and the brothers have now developed a warm, respectful, and loving relationship with their stepmother. It's telling that Camilla's granddaughter Eliza Lopes was a bridesmaid at William and Kate's wedding, and Harry even brought along a toy for her to play with. Camilla and Kate are also close. When Kate got married, Camilla gave her a special bracelet inscribed with both of their initials and has been best-placed to guide her through the ups and downs of marrying into one of the most famous families in the world."}
{"label": false, "txt": "It\u2019s Kardashian pregnancy and wedding rumors galore today: Just hours after another round of rumors that Kylie Jenner\u2019s gone into early labor comes a high-profile story claiming that Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s secret wedding to 24-year-old boyfriend Younes Bendjima has come and gone without a hitch.\n\nThis is at least the second time that Kourtney and Younes have said to either tied the knot or been ready to do so since the summer. Back then, with Scott Disick trying to get a rise out of Kourtney by engaging in his World Sex Tour, the story was that Kourtney had decided to put an end to Scott\u2019s shenanigans by getting married to Younes for Keeping Up With The Kardashians\u2018 cameras.\n\nThis time, the gossip comes from OK!\u2019s Australian edition, and alleges that Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s secret wedding to Younes came on an undisclosed Mexican beach. The magazine says that apparently, \u201cwith the world watching for the arrival of her sisters Kim, Khloe and Kylie Jenner\u2019s new babies, it\u2019s been the perfect time for low-key Kourt to sneak under the radar and say \u2018I do\u2019 in secret.\u201d\n\nHowever, their story trips up by going on to claim \u2014 in the very next sentence \u2014 that Kris Jenner is \u201cdesperate to air\u201d the supposedly secret ceremony on KUWTK. And just a bit later, the story then doubles down on its contradiction by further claiming that Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s secret wedding was atypical for the Kardashians in that it was only Kourtney and Younes and \u201ca celebrant on the beach, with no cameras around.\u201d\n\nFurther adding to the delightful deception is the magazine\u2019s cover, which does appear to depict a beach wedding ceremony, and which comes complete with privacy-ensuring canopies\u2026\n\n\u2026but which photo, as the good people at Gossip Cop point out, actually comes from Johnny Depp and Amber Heard\u2019s 2015 wedding. (Plus, there are way more than just three people in the cover photo, meaning the magazine is banking on its readers never putting the article\u2019s discrepancies together.)\n\nOn the other hand, KUWTK viewers were recently treated to Kourtney finding out how to treat herself to a little alone time with Younes. \u201cI\u2019ve definitely learned from my past relationship, where I really wouldn\u2019t travel without the kids,\u201d she told the show\u2019s cameras, when debating whether to jet off to Egypt for a kid-free vacation with her boyfriend. \u201cAnd I think it is important to take time, especially because my relationship is important to me.\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s entirely possible that 2018 will be the year we find out about Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s secret wedding \u2014 the real one, that is \u2014 after it\u2019s already happened, in a grand Kris Jenner-organized reveal. But, if 2017 taught us anything, it\u2019s just as likely that Kourtney will slouch her way into a why-not marriage with Scott Disick.\n\n(Photo credits: Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s secret wedding via Instagram, Splash News)\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"label": false, "txt": "\"The One with the Rumor\" is the ninth episode of the eighth season of the American television situation comedy Friends, which aired on NBC on November 22, 2001.[1] It continues the series' annual Thanksgiving-themed episode tradition, and guest-stars cast member Jennifer Aniston's then-husband Brad Pitt in the uncredited role of Will Colbert, who reveals that he and Ross (David Schwimmer) were part of an \"I hate Rachel\" club. The two of them hated Rachel Green (Aniston) and got the exchange student from Thailand to join their club. Will revealed that they spread a rumor in high school that Rachel (Aniston) was a hermaphrodite.\n\nThe episode was directed by Gary Halvorson and written by Shana Goldberg-Meehan.[1] It was nominated for multiple Primetime Emmy Awards, but was criticized as \"insulting\" by a national intersex education group. Pitt admitted his appearance was mainly to promote his upcoming film, Spy Game.\n\nPlot [ edit ]\n\nMonica invites an old school friend of hers and Ross' for Thanksgiving, Will Colbert (Brad Pitt). She also tells a crestfallen Joey Tribbiani that she won't be cooking a turkey because of Will's, Chandler's, Rachel's and Phoebe's aversion to the poultry. Joey admonishes Monica and demands the tradition, and so Monica obliges with a monstrous bird. Throughout the episode, Joey battles the enormous turkey, eventually changing into Phoebe's maternity clothing to ease the strain on his stomach.\n\nWill arrives and is revealed to have lost an enormous amount of weight. However, he reacts very badly when learning that Rachel Green, who he hated in high school, will be joining them for dinner. Rachel is immediately attracted to Will, unable to recognise him, but Will is openly hostile and this culminates in his proud announcement that he - and Ross - founded the \"I Hate Rachel\" club in high school and initiated a rumour that she was a hermaphrodite, which was spread throughout their entire high school. Rachel feels betrayed by Ross, until Monica reminds her that she started a rumor of her own that Ross made out with the school's 50-year-old librarian, though a horrified Ross confirms it as true. Rachel demands that Ross recant the rumour by calling everyone from school, but Monica puts them both in their place by reminding them that Rachel's rumour put Ross on the social radar, that Ross and Will's rumour had no effect whatsoever on Rachel's queen bee status, and that they're having a baby together. Will is completely dumbfounded by this revelation, but takes pleasure in the fact that Ross got Rachel pregnant but isn't going to marry her.\n\nThe episode culminates in Joey finishing off the turkey and getting the meat sweats. After being extremely full, Joey still had room for pie.\n\nProduction [ edit ]\n\nIt was reported by Entertainment Weekly that Pitt would don a fat suit for flashback scenes to his fat childhood,[2] though this was unfounded as Will's weight was merely referred to on screen.[3] Pitt frequently visited Aniston at the studios before and after his appearance, though he did not go onto the set for fear of distracting the audience.[4] When questioned about his appearance in the show, Pitt said it was to promote his upcoming film Spy Game, though added that he liked the series anyway.[3] The episode was taped on November 2, following four days of rehearsals.[5]\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nAs the series finale drew close in 2004, Eric Deggans of St. Petersburg Times ranked Pitt as one of the worst guest stars in Friends: \"Stilted reactions, overly exaggerated comedy, near-palpable self-consciousness - despite his cred as a film actor, Pitt knew he was out of his depth on a sitcom stage. After five minutes' viewing, the audience did, too.\"[6] His work on set is admired by the main stars; Schwimmer recalls Pitt was \"definitely [...] going against type\"[7] and LeBlanc called him \"really great on the show\".[4] USA Today rates Will's line \"Look at her standing there with those yams. My two greatest enemies, Ross. Rachel Green and complex carbohydrates\" one of the best of the episode.[8]\n\nThe eponymous rumor drew criticism from the intersex community, a member of which wrote a strongly worded letter of complaint to NBC, calling the episode \"ignorant, insulting, degrading, and absolutely unprofessional\". The member urged the network to learn about intersex individuals via the Society's website and read an on-air apology before future episodes.[9]\n\nPrimetime Emmy Award nominations [ edit ]\n\nPitt was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series for his appearance in the episode. Additionally, Nick McLean was nominated for Outstanding Cinematography for a Multi-Camera Series, while Stephen Prime was nominated for Outstanding Multi-Camera Picture Editing for a Series, for their work on the episode.[10]\n\nReferences [ edit ]"}

{"label": false, "txt": "(JTA) \u2014 Most artists would see playing one concert at New York\u2019s Madison Square Garden as a crowning achievement. Billy Joel has now done it 100 times.\n\nBefore and after his landmark show last week at the \u201cWorld\u2019s Most Famous Arena,\u201d the native Long Islander gave a series of interviews about his legacy. In one with CBS News, he was asked about the most memorable moments during his incredible \u2014 and likely all-time record-breaking \u2014 MSG run.\n\nAfter mentioning the nights that involved his daughter Della onstage, Joel brought up the concert during which he wore a yellow Star of David. Joel pinned the star to his jacket during the encore of a Garden show last August, shortly after white supremacists and neo-Nazis led a deadly march in Charlottesville, Virginia.\n\n\u201cThis past year or so, there was the night I wore the Star of David, after the Charlottesville incident,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough Joel is usually described as atheist or secular, his father was a German-born Jew who recalled the rise of Hitler and lost relatives in the Holocaust. CBS interviewer Anthony Mason pointed out that Joel usually avoids taking political stands.\n\nOn the weekend of the rally, President Donald Trump said \u201cboth sides\u201d were to blame for the violence that occurred \u2014 and that were some \u201cvery fine people\u201d among the far-right marchers as well as their opponents. That struck a dark chord with the songwriter.\n\n\u201cI had to do something that night,\u201d Joel responded. \u201cThe president said [after the Charlottesville rally], you know, \u2018There\u2019s some good people on that side \u2026\u2019 No, Nazis aren\u2019t good people.\n\n\u201cIt really enraged me, actually,\u201d he continued. \u201cMy old man, his family got wiped out. They were slaughtered in Auschwitz. Him and his parents were able to get out. But then he was in the U.S. Army during the war and fought with Patton and was shot at by Nazis. \u2026 My family suffered. And I think I actually have a right to do that.\u201d\n\nWhile many found the act courageous, it prompted some criticism.\n\nBut the singer also started a trend. Soon after, TV star Nev Schulman and musician and producer Jack Antonoff (both outwardly Jewish) both wore Jewish stars at the MTV Video Music Awards \u2014 Schulman wore one pinned to his suit jacket, and Antonoff wore one in necklace form.

{"label": false, "txt": "Gossip Cop busted 2,404 stories in 2016. That\u2019s nearly a 60 percent increase over 2015, when we busted 1,504 stories. That year, OK! was our worst offender, but this time around, the dishonor belongs to its sister publication, the National Enquirer.\n\nThe National Enquirer was corrected by Gossip Cop 335 times over the course of 2016. Going from ranking fifth on our scorecard in 2015 to the number one spot now, the supermarket tabloid was responsible for some egregious cover stories, photo manipulations, and outright falsehoods. At times, the publication seemed to be little more than a propaganda machine for Donald Trump. One September issue, for instance, declared to have Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cfull medical file,\u201d and a list of \u201cdeadly health conditions\u201d from which Clinton was supposedly suffering, such as muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer\u2019s, liver damage from alcoholism, brain damage and more.\n\nBut Clinton wasn\u2019t the only victim. The National Enquirer also alleged Angelina Jolie was \u201cdying,\u201d and manufactured a cover story about Brad Pitt beating Jolie during their marriage. That edition featured a seemingly doctored photo of the actress with bruises on her face. There was also absolutely no question the outlet engaged in some unscrupulous behavior in May, when it tried to dupe readers into thinking it had video and photos from Prince\u2019s death (see above). In actuality, the National Enquirer morbidly staged the shots with a body double, only acknowledging in tiny print that they were \u201cphoto recreations.\u201d\n\nThe magazine often worked in tandem in 2016 with its sister site RadarOnline, which ranks as our second-worst offender of the year with just one fewer correction than its print counterpart, for a total of 334 busts. It was not unusual to see an untrue tale first spun on the RadarOnline website and then published with minimal changes in the National Enquirer, or vice versa. But the blog was also up to no good all on its own. In December alone, Gossip Cop debunked 45 stories from the webloid. Among them was a story purporting to have video from Kim Kardashian\u2019s Paris robbery. The footage, however, was not actually connected to the crime at all.\n\nOK!, which topped our scorecard in 2015, dropped down to third last year. But that is in no way an indication that the tabloid\u2019s accuracy has improved. In fact, while we busted the magazine 196 times in 2015, we corrected 328 of its articles in 2016. And many of those stories outright contradicted each other. One week in February, the tabloid published a cover story announcing Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani had \u201csplit.\u201d But issues that came out before and after that report wrongly touted tales of marriage and pregnancy. None of it, though, was true. Just as fact-checking ranked low on the OK! priority list, so did consistency.\n\nCuriously, these three outlets, along with Star, which ranks fourth on our year-end chart, are all run by the same media conglomerate. The year 2016 was when fake news broke out in the mainstream, and these gossip publications seemingly played a part in that. RadarOnline and other online-based outlets, such as HollywoodLife and Celeb Dirty Laundry, added to this epidemic by appearing to manufacture content designed to game search engines and go viral on social media. And, when not seemingly making up such stories, these blogs were responsible for regurgitating tabloid articles and often adding unique, yet unverifiable details.\n\nGossip Cop was founded in 2009, but it was only in 2014 that we began to keep a daily bust record of every story we corrected, something we call our \u201ctabloid tally.\u201d We do all this to hold outlets accountable, and never before has this job been more important. There is a misconception that celebrity-related content is simply entertainment, and therefore need not be accurate. This is not true.\n\nThe number one tenet in journalism, no matter what the area covered, is accuracy. Entertainment reporting is not always so serious, and can at times be salacious, but none of this should be at the expense of fact-checking and truth-telling. Gossip Cop is not error-free, but we take great pride in our dedication to veracity. In 2017, we vow to continue separating fact from fiction, keep tracking what\u2019s real and what\u2019s rumor, and always bust bad dish.\n\nGOSSIP COP\u2019S 2016 TABLOID SCORECARD*\n\n1.

{"label": false, "txt": "While known as the reserved one in the clan, Kendall Jenner has allegedly morphed into a terrifying employer. The latest report from OK! via Gossip Cop alleges that the Victoria\u2019s Secret model is a \u201cboss from hell\u201d who makes life tough for the people who work for her.\n\n\u201cEveryone thinks she\u2019s the sweetest, shyest Kardashian sister, but over the last year she\u2019s made so much money and won so much praise that it\u2019s gone to her head.\u201d\n\nThe magazine\u2019s so-called insider recalled an instance when Kendall\u2019s assistant served her the wrong kind of iced tea and instead of being grateful, Kendall reportedly \u201cmade her pay for a new one out of pocket.\u201d The insider also purported that the runway model would fire employees who would attempt to talk about her behind her back. What she allegedly does is to tell her mother, Kris Jenner, that the employee is incompetent.\n\nHowever, Gossip Cop shed some light on the issue and confirmed through a source close to Kendall that the magazine\u2019s claims are unfounded. As someone who has firsthand experiences of bullying, it isn\u2019t fair if Kendall would do the same to her team.\n\nJust last month, Victoria\u2019s Secret Angel Adriana Lima defended Kendall from bullies and acknowledged her pleasant attitude. She told E! Online that Kendall works just as hard as other models in the industry.\n\n\u201cI have worked with Kendall on runways before when we were in Europe, like Versace and also with Victoria\u2019s Secret. Kendall is very sweet and very nice, and it\u2019s always pleasant to work with someone like that. You know, she works as hard as we do, so I give her credit for all the effort. And I think she is going to do great because Victoria\u2019s Secret is all about personality, and she has her own personality.\u201d\n\nIn a previous interview with Garage magazine via E! Online, Kendall also revealed that she\u2019s been following the Golden Rule since she was young.\n\n\u201cI aim to treat others as I want to be treated. I know that sounds slightly basic, but when it comes to humans and human nature, the simplest answer is usually the right one. It really is as easy as that.\u201d\n\nShe understands that everyone is entitled to have an opinion, but she chooses not to focus her energy on dealing with the ruthless things said about her.\n\nWhen she was still starting, some models allegedly bullied Kendall as they believed that it was only because of her famous last name that she managed to get a spot in the competitive industry. Some were reportedly complaining that she only bought her career, and she was undeserving of the special treatment from major designers.\n\nThe Keeping Up with the Kardashians star then opted to drop her last name and simply go by \u201cKendall\u201d when working. As much as possible, she also does want her family members to watch her shows.\n\nLast year, Kendall admitted through the reality show that she\u2019s having a difficult time working because of her sleep paralysis. Since the paralysis often happens when she\u2019s on the plane, she\u2019s starting to develop a fear of traveling; something which Kris finds alarming.\n\n\u201cThe nature of what you do for a living and your career is flying around the world. You have designers that have already booked you and are counting on you to show up,\u201d she told her daughter. Kendall responded that perhaps her health is more significant than those jobs.\n\nApart from meeting with a therapist, Kim Kardashian also arranged a meditation for her younger sister upon learning about Kendall\u2019s dilemma.\n\n[Featured Image by Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images for Vogue]"}
{"label": false, "txt": "When Prince William and Kate\u2018s official announcement that she is pregnant came Monday, the palace said she was \u201cexpecting a baby.\u201d\n\nBut in light of the fact that the Duchess of Cambridge is also suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, a form of acute morning sickness, there has been growing speculation that she may, in fact, be expecting twins.\n\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, the Duchess\u2019s rare condition tends to appear more often in women carrying twins.\n\nSo what would it mean for the royal family if Kate, 30 \u2013 who was discharged from the hospital Thursday \u2013 were to deliver two little royals? A pair of heirs?\n\nNope, royal experts tell PEOPLE. In fact, it\u2019s all a bit complicated.\n\nPHOTOS: Prince William & Kate Middleton\u2019s Pregnancy Clues in 5 Clicks\n\nThe firstborn twin would have a completely different path than his or her sibling, says royal historian Robert Lacey, author of The Queen: A Life in Brief: \u201cThe first child to appear will have precedence. Whichever one comes out first will be the heir \u2013 and it will be the call of the obstetrician if there is a caesarean section.\u201d\n\nAnd the obstetrician will make that delivery based on the location of the babies during labor, Mark Johnson, Professor of Obstetrics at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, tells PEOPLE.\n\nSays Johnson: \u201cIf delivering vaginally, the first baby to enter the pelvis will be delivered first. If delivering by c-section it very much depends on the which baby is closest to the incision, generally that will be the lower of the two babies.\u201d\n\nA year ago, the British government voted to modernize the rule of succession so that in the event of twins, a firstborn girl would not lose the title of heir if a boy were to be subsequently born to the royal couple. But that rule hasn\u2019t been implemented yet.\n\nUnder the current law of the land, says Lacey, \u201cIf the twins are a girl first followed by a boy, the boy will be next in succession.\u201d\n\nWhen or if the law is changed, adds Lacey, \u201cthe boy would be ousted by his sister.\u201d\n\nIf Kate is pregnant with twins, William, who will surely be present for the births, will be able to see firsthand which baby is born first. But in the past that wasn\u2019t the case, adds Lacey.\n\nIn other eras, \u201cthe Home Secretary was on hand in the hospital to ensure there was no foul play,\u201d says Lacey, \u201csince there were fears that if the firstborn turned out to be a girl, she might get swapped for a substitute baby boy \u2013 and smuggled into the bed in a warming pan.\u201d\n\nPHOTOS: Prince William and Kate\u2019s Lucky Little One: Lupo!"}
