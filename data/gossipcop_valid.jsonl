{"label": true, "txt": "You are going to hurt somebody, you are going to hurt somebody deeply. But, I will not be one of those people. I cannot focus on the negative comments or indecently hateful words being said about me or my relationship even though they do sting. I do know great people that I care about deeply that comments and criticisms have affected and as a result I wanted to share my words. A small minority of people (at least I will continue to believe it is a small minority) want to see people suffer or fail. Personally, my basis for judging myself is simple, if I do something that doesn\u2019t represent Christ then I will listen to the opinions and words from family and friends who know me best and love me. I do desire (by the direction of family and peers) to become a better person daily. I know some will not agree with my intentions but in all things my pursuit is to represent Christ better. With that, I will once again clearly tell you I AM NOT PERFECT as none of us are and I have never claimed to be. I do desire to show love in all situations (do I always do that? No, I fail often). To be clear, not that this should be a surprise, but this podcast is a professional decision I have made to enhance my life and career. I still have a full time job. I am still running Generous Coffee company. I still have a blog. I am still actively involved in @humanityandhope. And now, because I was given the opportunity, I have added a podcast with a friend and a great company (@iheartradio) to talk about life (and I love to talk). The last few months have not gone the way I would have preferred. My relationships have changed drastically and what I envisioned my life was going to be has been redirected. It is sad, but it is nothing you should feel sorry for me about, life happens both the good and bad. With this, what do you think I should do now? For all of you that have given me advice let me give you some from my heart. Love as hard as you can (even to strangers). Ask yourself what life is about and pursue your conclusion with passion. When a good opportunity comes your way that fits your desires take it, because life is short but a lot more fun when you are doing something you enjoy.\n\nA post shared by Ben Higgins (@higgins.ben) on May 30, 2017 at 11:11am PDT"}
{"label": true, "txt": "Jason Isaacs Almost Turned Down the Role of Lucius Malfoy in \u201cHarry Potter\u201d\n\nJason Isaacs was the perfect Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter films, but in a new interview with Digital Spy, the actor admitted that he was \u201cmightily pissed off\u201d after being asked to audition for the role. In fact, he almost turned it down.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t audition for Lucius; I auditioned for Gilderoy Lockhart,\u201d he explained. Afterward, they asked him to read for another part \u2014 one that he knew he didn\u2019t want. (The role of Gilderoy Lockhart, the Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor, eventually went to Kenneth Branagh.)\n\n\u201cI was about to go play Captain Hook [in 2003\u2019s Peter Pan] and didn\u2019t want to do two children\u2019s [movie] villains,\u201d Isaacs told Digital Spy of why he was against playing the nefarious wizard.\n\nDespite his hesitation, he did the reading for Lucius Malfoy \u2014 and clearly, he nailed it. But when he got home, he immediately informed his agent that it wasn\u2019t going to happen. \u201cI said to my agent, \u2018When they call, tell them no, thank you very much, I am about to go play Captain Hook.'\u201d\n\nThankfully (for Isaacs and fans of the Harry Potter films), the actor\u2019s agent wasn\u2019t about to take no for an answer. At least not that quickly. He encouraged his client to take the weekend to mull it over, but Isaacs didn\u2019t want to even do that. \u201cI said, \u2018No, I don\u2019t want to think about it \u2014 it\u2019s fun and lovely and flattering but I am not playing two children\u2019s villains!'\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, though, he had a change of heart. \u201c[E]verybody I knew called me \u2014 nieces, nephews, godchildren, and then the parents,\u201d Isaacs told Digital Spy. \u201cThey all tried to persuade me to take the job \u2014 not because they cared about me but because they wanted to visit the set! So, I took the job and thank God I did!\u201d\n\nIsaacs appeared in six of the Harry Potter films \u2014 and he\u2019s open to doing more if the opportunity ever presents itself. \u201cIf [JK Rowling] called me and went, \u2018I want to do a Lucius Malfoy spinoff film,\u2019 she wouldn\u2019t get to the middle of her sentence before I\u2019ve said yes and left my house! But I am not holding my breath for that call.\u201d\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, we would LOVE to see a Lucius Malfoy spinoff movie.\n\nDid you love (or love to hate) Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy?

{"label": true, "txt": "Most of us have wondered what happened to certain kids from our school days, but few can have had their worlds rocked quite like the comic book artist John Backderf, when he found out what his erstwhile friend Jeffrey Dahmer had been up to.\n\nAfter they\u2019d graduated from high school, Dahmer vanished. \u201cI can\u2019t say my friends and I were terribly concerned about it, but we did comment on it, from time to time,\u201d says Backderf, aka Derf, on the phone from New York. \u201cWe knew his parents lived in town and yet we never saw him anywhere.\u201d\n\nWhen Dahmer was arrested in 1991, he discovered why: Dahmer had already embarked on a murderous journey that would brutally extinguish 17 lives and make him one of America\u2019s most notorious and depraved serial killers.\n\nJoin Independent Minds For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read Get the best of The Independent With an Independent Minds subscription Get the best of The Independent Without the ads\n\nAlthough the revelation shocked Backderf, he\u2019d thought from quite early on that there was something off about \u201cJeff\u201d. \u201cThere was always a darkness about him that was really kind of repellent,\u201d recalls the artist, who had been \u201cwary\u201d of him as a consequence.\n\n\u201cI was OK with hanging out with him, if there was other people around. I was never going to be alone with him. And I\u2019m pretty happy I had that instinct, because that could have well been me chopped up in the trunk of his car,\u201d says Backderf, audibly shivering as he alludes to the gruesome fate of Dahmer\u2019s 19-year-old first victim, Steven Hicks.\n\nWe are talking because Backderf\u2019s acclaimed 2012 graphic novel, My Friend Dahmer, has been adapted into a well-received movie, featuring a chilling performance by ex-Disney star and singer Ross Lynch as the teenage Dahmer, spiralling towards the abyss.\n\nWhen Backderf visited the set, the unnerving accuracy of Lynch\u2019s transformation made it hard for him to talk to the actor when he was in costume. \u201cHe just reminded me so much of Jeff. It was spooky.\u201d\n\nThis was undoubtedly enhanced by writer-director Marc Meyers\u2019s decision to film scenes at Dahmer\u2019s actual boyhood home in Bath, Ohio, which today is owned by a musician-friend of Backderf\u2019s. The house is where Dahmer became a murderer, and Backderf admits that he didn\u2019t think they would film there.\n\n\u201cI understand why they did, especially on an indie-film budget,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s sacred ground, and I kept telling them, \u2018You really can\u2019t lose sight of that. You can never lose sight, making this movie, where it ends.\u2019 And I don\u2019t think they did.\u201d\n\nDahmer\u2019s house was around eight miles from Backderf\u2019s, and when they were juniors their paths mainly crossed at school, as lab partners and whatnot.\n\n\u201cThe problem with our town was it was a rural town, and there were these country roads that were not safe to bike on with long distances, so you were limited to kids in your immediate area to be friends with. So we were not going to really become friends. And I don\u2019t know whether I had any interest in becoming his friend at that point.\u201d\n\nWhen they reached high school, Dahmer changed. Previously quiet, he started throwing fake fits and doing a mocking impression of a local interior designer with cerebral palsy (Backderf later discovered that in fact he was copying his own mother, who was known to have mental health issues).\n\nIn the film, Backderf and his friends are fascinated by this behaviour and recruit him, forming the Dahmer Fan Club, with Backderf as its minister for propaganda. In reality, Dahmer came to them, claims the cartoonist.\n\n\u201cThe film strikes a different tone than what it really was, which was that he was a very willing participant in all of this. He loved every minute of it.\u201d\n\nDahmer \u201cinserted himself\u201d into their group, bringing a \u201cweirdness to the table\u201d that they \u201cwholeheartedly embraced\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe were bored stiff,\u201d recalls Backderf, \u201cand just looking to get through the day, and Jeff was entertainment. He was a little bit dangerous, he was a little bit unpredictable, and that was fun for us.\u201d\n\nHe insists they weren\u2019t as casually cruel as the film suggests. \u201c[Meyers] makes my character a little meaner than I was in real life. I wasn\u2019t a mean kid. I certainly was not empathetic, I don\u2019t know many 17-year-olds that are. I don\u2019t shy away from my role in this, and never have, but the truth is that we were all kind of doing it together.\u201d\n\nThey joined in the disablist mockery (\u201cThat\u2019s hard to explain away\u2026 pretty inexcusable by any stretch of the imagination. But I chalk it up just to being 17 and being an idiot\u201d), tried to hide Dahmer in plain sight in school club group photographs, placed drawings of him wherever they could. It was a laugh, until it wasn\u2019t \u2013 Dahmer started drinking heavily and grew noticeably darker, frightening Backderf so much that he eventually \u201cwrote Jeff off\u201d.\n\nDahmer\u2019s arrest years later threw Backderf into a state of confusion. \u201cWith a snap of a finger, my entire personal history changed\u2026 Suddenly all these silly things, all of this stuff that we did as teenagers, it becomes something very different. It becomes very dark, almost dangerous.\u201d\n\nUnknown to him, while they were playing, Dahmer had been secretly struggling with his emerging homosexuality, and necrophiliac urges that scared and repulsed him to such an extent that he\u2019d tried to tamp them down with alcohol.\n\nPut into context his \u201cbehaviour at school became very chilling,\u201d says Backderf, \u201cbecause he was perfecting the tools that he would use to become such a lethal killer. The ability to vanish. The ability to not give anything away and to charm people. The ability to hide everything that was going on in his head.\n\n\u201cAll those things he perfected when he was very young through our goofball antics, he used them when he was a monster. That\u2019s a little hard to live with.\u201d\n\nBackderf doesn\u2019t believe the course Dahmer\u2019s life took was inevitable, though, and his question has always been: where were the adults? Dahmer\u2019s behaviour was bizarre, and his drinking was obvious to everyone, but no one in authority intervened.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t care. They just pushed him along and figured, \u2018Well, next year he\u2019ll be somebody else\u2019s problem.\u2019 And of course he was somebody else\u2019s problem.\u201d\n\nHe could easily have been Backderf\u2019s. When he put the timeline of Dahmer\u2019s activities together for the graphic novel, he was shocked to discover that he and his friends had been nearby when Dahmer had killed Hicks and cut up his corpse. \u201cWe were all around it at various points, in some cases mere yards away. That was a little tough to process.\u201d\n\nWhile Dahmer would go on to kill again and again, it is the slaughter of Hicks that resonates most with Backderf.\n\n\u201cHe haunts me still,\u201d he says sadly. \u201cI think about him from time to time.\u201d\n\nThey didn\u2019t know each other, as Hicks went to a different school, \u201cbut he was like so many kids that I knew,\u201d says Backderf. \u201cJust kind of this affable rock\u2019n\u2019roller who just wanted to smoke a little weed, listen to some music, have a beer, hang out with friends, and his life was snuffed out just because he took a ride with the wrong guy. It was just so arbitrary.\u201d\n\nIt took him a long time to deal with the truth about his friendship with Dahmer, and the role he\u2019d unwittingly played in encouraging parts of his pathology. He didn\u2019t start writing about it until after Dahmer was beaten to death in prison in 1994.\n\nSeeing their relationship recreated on screen (Alex Wolff plays him in the film) has been surreal. \u201cBut in a long list of things that are surreal about this story, it\u2019s just another entry,\u201d he laughs.\n\n\u201cAt this point, after 25 years, I just kind of shrug and say, \u2018Well that was weird\u2019, and move on. It doesn\u2019t really have an impact on me anymore.\u201d\n\nListening to him talking about Hicks, however, it seems clear that not all of the wounds have healed.\n\n\u2018My Friend Dahmer\u2019 is in cinemas on 1 June; \u2018My Friend Dahmer\u2019 by Derf Backderf is published by Abrams ComicArts"}

January Jones is not holding back when it comes to talking about being a single mother \u2014 and the damper it can put on intimacy.\n\n\u201cIt limits your sex life, for sure,\u201d the 40-year-old Mad Men alum said during an interview with Violet Gray published on Friday, January 26.\n\nShe explained: \u201cBecause you can\u2019t bring someone home when your kid\u2019s coming into the room. Honestly, my son turns up in the middle of the night and asks for a massage, and then I fall asleep. I imagine that\u2019s what marriage is like?\u201d\n\nBut the blonde beauty \u2014 who has recently been linked to The Bachelor\u2019s Nick Viall \u2014 revealed how important she thinks lovemaking is.\n\n\u201cSex, what\u2019s that? As my mom always said, sex is a gauge of your relationship, so if you have a good relationship you should be having sex regularly,\u201d Jones told the outlet. \u201cEven if you\u2019re angry or you\u2019ve been together for a million and five years. You have to force yourself to have that physical connection.\u201d\n\nAs for what makes for good sex? \u201c[Being] comfortable with your body,\u201d she said.\n\nThe Last Man on Earth actress continued to detail how she believes you become happy in your own skin. \u201cI don\u2019t know about men, but for women I think that comes with age\u2014knowing and loving yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen I was younger, I wouldn\u2019t ask for things I knew I wanted because I was insecure. And everybody\u2019s different, so guys don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to work. But hopefully now I\u2019m more comfortable with my body and my sexuality.\u201d\n\nAnd perhaps she\u2019ll find her final rose with Viall. Though nothing has been confirmed, the duo, amid reports that they were dating, have showed subtle displays of affection on social media since earlier this month, Us Weekly previously reported.\n\nPrior to fans pointing out their flirty interactions, Jones admitted in a November interview on The Late Late Show with James Corden that Viall had randomly reached out to her.\n\n\u201cHe asked me to battle him on Lip Sync Battle,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cSo is that, like, his way of asking me out, or does he have a problem with me? I don\u2019t know what that was. But I declined, because I don\u2019t need to be humiliated.\u201d\n\nShe added, jokingly: \u201cYou don\u2019t know if you like him or if he\u2019s a scumbag \u2014 and I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m attracted to him, maybe?\u201d\n\nJones was previously linked to director Noah Miller, Jason Sudeikis, Ashton Kutcher and Josh Groban.\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!"}

To put salt in our wounds, the insider added that Spice Girls \"were never going to perform\" at the wedding in the first place. This news follows previous reports that the whole girl gang had received invites for the May 19 nuptials.\n\nAnd now, Mel C has spoken out about being left off of the guest list. Appearing on Australian radio program Fitzy & Wippa this week (via Daily Mail), Mel C announced, \"I should clear up the invitation part of it\u2014we were never invited!\" Basically, Mel B's previous claims that the group would be performing at the wedding appear to have been untrue.\n\nMel C reiterated that, \"No. We were never invited, we were never asked to perform... and I was a little bit annoyed, actually!\" She also revealed that, having seen Prince Charles at an event recently, she was tempted to say something about the snub. She told the hosts, \"He's a lovely, lovely man. But I felt like going 'Oy! Where's my invite?'\"\n\nTMZ also reported earlier this week that \"there are no current plans to have the group perform at any point in the festivities.\" Prince Harry, Meghan Markle and Kensington Palace had reportedly not asked the iconic girl group to take the stage for their big day.\n\nSources told the TMZ that Spice Girls \"haven't rehearsed anything for the wedding,\" further shutting down speculation for a performance. So although the epic quintet are officially reuniting, it looks like the royal wedding isn't included in their list of new projects.\n\nSpeculation over Spice Girls' possible royal wedding cameo began in February, after Mel B's vague answers about the ceremony left fans to believe she and the rest of the band would be present at the event.\n\nEllie Goulding performed at Prince William and Kate Middleton's reception in 2011; which pop star will take the stage for Harry and Meghan's ceremony?"}

No return date for Season 2 of Talking With Chris Hardwick has been set yet due to scheduling issues, I hear. All episodes are already in the can.\n\nDeadline revealed July 4 that Community actor Brown would be taking over Hardwick\u2019s SDCC duties. A week later, AMC confirmed that Brown, who called Hardwick a \u201cfriend\u201d in a Independence Day tweet, would be fronting the Season 9 preview special for the zombie-apocalypse series and the series\u2019 much watched aftershow as an \u201cinterim host\u201d \u2014 only half of which she is doing now.\n\nReps for Hardwick did not respond to request for comment on the move by AMC.\n\nAfter accusations by Hardwick\u2019s ex Chloe Dykstra surfaced on June 15, AMC a day later pulled the Season 2 June 17 premiere of Talking with Chris Hardwick. At the time, the calber also said that The Wall host would not participate in Talking Dead for the immediate future, nor for the TWD or Doctor Who panels at SDCC he had already been set for.\n\nOn June 15, Hardwick strongly denied the allegations from Dykstra, which included sexual and emotional abuse.\n\n\u201cThese are very serious allegations and not to be taken lightly which is why I\u2019ve taken the day to consider how to respond,\u201d said Hardwick that night. \u201cI was heartbroken to read Chloe\u2019s post. Our three year relationship was not perfect\u2014we were ultimately not a good match and argued\u2014even shouted at each other\u2014but I loved her, and did my best to uplift and support her as a partner and companion in any way and at no time did I sexually assault her.\u201d\n\nThe adamant response from the longtime AMC host and Nerdist founder followed the detailed and harrowing first-person account that Dykstra wrote for Medium. The post never called out Hardwick by name, but the post by TV personality and Syfy\u2019s Heroes of Cosplay castmember made it pretty clear whom she was talking about. With the duo having played out so much of their time together in the public and digital spotlight, there were details about the \u201cmildly successful podcaster\u201d who became \u201ca powerhouse CEO of his own company, their age difference and more. The details were indicative of the now married Hardwick, who announced online his break-up with Dykstra in 2014.\n\nDeclaring on June 16 that they were assessing the allegations, NBC has not announced whether Hardwick will be back for more of The Wall later this year."}

ABC\n\nIn the world of reality dating shows, talking about your past relationships and sex life is par for the course, but few would think that extended to the show's producers.\n\nYet that's exactly what a former segment producer for \"The Bachelor\" claims happened to her in a new complaint against Warner Bros., which produces the show.\n\nBecky Steenhoek \u2014 who worked on the production for the 2016 season of \"The Bachelorette\" with JoJo Fletcher\u2014 filed a lawsuit on Monday in the Los Angeles Superior Court and spoke with the Los Angeles Times about what occurred between her and five other producers, who were also named along with Warner Bros. in the complaint.\n\nSteenhoek, 31, says that the show's executive and cast producers named in the complaint would ask her personal questions that were extremely sexual in nature, including about her personal grooming habits, sex life, and masturbation.\n\n\"You could visibly tell it was very uncomfortable to me to witness, just because they did make comments like, 'Oh, Becky's blushing,' or 'Her ears are probably burning,'\" Steenhoek told The Times, adding that her colleagues' questions made her uncomfortable.\n\nWhen she asked her female coworker Caitlin Stapleton \u2014 a cast producer on the show \u2014 what to do about it, Steenhoek said Stapleton told her that was just \"the way of the industry and world that we work in,\" adding that the behavior was \"locker-room talk\" and a way to bond.\n\nSteenhoek said after confiding in Stapleton, her job markedly changed from attending production meetings to fetching meals for her bosses before being told she wasn't needed for the remainder of the season. When she asked why, she said she was told it was because she wasn't enough of a \"bitch.\"\n\nSteenhoek was a producer on Fletcher's season of \"The Bachelorette.\" ABC\n\nSteenhoek is now suing Warner Bros., \"Bachelor\" creator Mike Fleiss' production company NZK Productions, as well as producers Elan Gale, Peter Scalettar, Jacqueline Naz Perez, Bennett Graebner, and Stapleton for \"damages related to sexual harassment and hostile work environment, sex discrimination, retaliation, failure to prevent harassment, intentional infliction of emotional distress and wrongful termination,\" according to the LA Times.\n\nIn a statement to INSIDER, Warner Bros. said it had previously investigated Steenhoek's claims and didn't feel their findings supported her claims. Read the full statement below:\n\n\"We take all allegations of workplace harassment very seriously. These allegations were brought to our attention and were thoroughly investigated earlier this year. Our findings did not support the plaintiff's characterization of the events claimed to have taken place, which is why we are disappointed by the filing of this lawsuit.\"\n\nSteenhoek's lawsuit comes at a time when powerful industry players in Hollywood like producer Harvey Weinstein or director James Toback are being accused of sexual harassment. And it's not just in Hollywood \u2014 many powerful men are now being accused of sexual misconduct, including Ben Affleck and Kevin Spacey."}

Blanket was seven years old when his father, Michael Jackson, died on June 25, 2009. His grandmother, Katherine Jackson, became his legal guardian, as well as the guardian of his siblings, Michael Joseph and Paris Jackson. Due to Katherine's advanced age, along with Michael and Paris leaving the nest as young adults, Blanket is now under the supervision of older cousin T.J.

The identity of his biological mother, a surrogate, is unknown.

Michael Jackson reportedly left each of his three children $33 million.\n\nBlanket Jackson Today\n\nBlanket Jackson is enrolled in private school in Los Angeles. While sources told People magazine that he had the hardest time of his siblings adjusting after his father\u2019s death, he is now doing well, focusing on grades and sports and spending time with his more than 30 cousins. Blanket lives with Katherine Jackson, who became his legal guardian along with siblings Michael Jr. and Paris, as dictated by Michael Jackson's will. Due to Katherine's advanced age, T.J. Jackson, Michael Jackson\u2019s nephew, is Blanket\u2019s guardian.\n\nA rare photo of Blanket Jackson, along with friend Omer Bhatti, sister Paris and brother Prince in December 2017. (Photo: Paris Jackson's Instagram)\n\nBlanket Jackson\u2019s Name Change\n\nIn 2015 several reports surfaced that Blanket no longer wished to be called by his nickname. Radar Online claimed that the young teen now wanted to be addressed as \"Bigi.\" He took the name after being bullied for years for his \"Blanket\" moniker. He lives in Calabasas, California, and attends the Buckley School in Sherman Oaks, California.\n\nFather\u2019s Death\n\nOn June 25, 2009, Blanket's father, Michael Jackson, suffered cardiac arrest at his home in Los Angeles, and died shortly thereafter. The pop star was 50 years old at the time of his death; Blanket was seven.\n\nIn February 2010, an official coroner's report on Michael Jackson's death was released, revealing that the singer had died from acute propofol intoxication. Aided by his personal physician, Dr. Conrad Murray, Michael had used the drug, among others, to help him sleep. A police investigation revealed later that Murray hadn't been licensed to prescribe most controlled medications in California, and the doctor's actions as Michael's caretaker were subsequently further scrutinized. Murray was found guilty of homicide on November 7, 2011, receiving a four-year prison sentence.\n\nBelieving that A.E.G. Live \u2014 the entertainment company that promoted Michael Jackson's planned comeback series, \"This Is It,\" in 2009 \u2014 had failed to effectively protect the singer while he was under Murray's care, the Jackson family decided to take legal action against the company. Katherine Jackson officially filed a wrongful death lawsuit against A.E.G. with Blanket, Michael Jr. and Paris, and the trial began in April 2013. Lawyers sought up to $1.5 billion, an estimation of what Michael Jackson could have earned over the months since his death if he were still alive, in the case.\n\nIn October 2013, a jury determined that A.E.G. wasn't responsible for Michael's death. \"Although Michael Jackson's death was a terrible tragedy, it was not a tragedy of A.E.G. Live's making,\" said Marvin S. Putnam, A.E.G.'s lawyer.\n\nAmong the Jackson's kids, Blanket has generally stayed out of the spotlight. However, he, along with Michael Jr. and Paris, spoke to their father's fans during his funeral in 2009, and again in January 2010, accepting a posthumous Lifetime Achievement Award for Michael Jackson at the Grammy Awards."}

I hope that as you grow up, I can teach you to love and embrace the miraculous physical vessel that is carrying your magnificent heart and soul.\n\nYou don't know this yet, but our society is pretty obsessed with body image. Before too long (it's inevitable) you'll be bombarded with images of perfection almost nobody can attain.

But when you think about your body, let's think not about how it looks, but about all the things it can do. Let's think about your strength and your endurance.

For the title, see Duke of Sussex\n\nAmerican member of the British royal family, former actress\n\nMeghan, Duchess of Sussex (born Rachel Meghan Markle; August 4, 1981), is a retired American actress who became a member of the British royal family upon her marriage to Prince Harry.\n\nMarkle was born and raised in Los Angeles, California, and is of mixed race heritage. During her studies at Northwestern University, she began playing small roles in American television series and films. From 2011 to 2017, she played Rachel Zane, on the American legal drama series Suits. An outspoken feminist, Markle has addressed issues of gender inequality, and her lifestyle website The Tig featured a column profiling influential women. She represented international charity organisations in the 2010s. She has received recognition for her fashion and style, releasing a line of clothing in 2016.\n\nFrom 2011 until their divorce in 2013, Markle was married to actor and producer Trevor Engelson. In 2017, she announced her engagement to Prince Harry, grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, and moved to London. She retired from acting, closed her social media accounts, and started undertaking public engagements as part of the British royal family. She became the Duchess of Sussex on her marriage to Prince Harry in May 2018.\n\nEarly life and education [ edit ]\n\nRachel Meghan Markle was born on August 4, 1981, in Los Angeles, California,[1] at West Park Hospital in Canoga Park.[2] As of 2017, her mother, Doria Ragland, a social worker and yoga instructor lives in View Park\u2013Windsor Hills, California.[1][3] Markle has often described a very close friendship with her mother.[4] Her father, Thomas Markle Sr., who lives in Rosarito, Mexico,[5][6] is a retired television director of photography and lighting director, whose profession resulted in his young daughter often visiting the set of Married...with Children.[7][8] Markle's parents divorced when she was six years old.[9][10] She has two older paternal half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jr., from whom she is reportedly estranged.[11]\n\nDescribing her heritage in a 2015 essay for Elle, Markle states that her \"dad is Caucasian and my mom is African American. I'm half black and half white ... While my mixed heritage may have created a grey area surrounding my self-identification, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that. To say who I am, to share where I'm from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman.\"[12]\n\nMarkle grew up in Hollywood.[13] She was educated at private schools, beginning at age two at the Hollywood Little Red Schoolhouse.[14][15] At age 11, her successful campaign to get Procter & Gamble to change a national television commercial she viewed as sexist was profiled by Linda Ellerbee on Nick News.[16] Though she was raised as a Protestant,[17] Markle attended Immaculate Heart High School, an all-girl Catholic private school in Los Angeles.[18] She then attended Northwestern University, where she joined Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority and participated in community service and charity projects.[19][20] Markle graduated from Northwestern's School of Communication in 2003 with a bachelor's degree and a double major in theater and international studies.[21][22] She also served an internship at the American embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina,[22] and studied for a semester in Madrid, Spain.[20]\n\nActing career [ edit ]\n\nEarly in her career, Markle worked as a freelance calligrapher to support herself between acting jobs.[7] Her first on-screen appearance was a small role as a nurse in an episode of the daytime soap opera General Hospital.[23][24] Markle had small guest roles on the television shows Century City (2004), The War at Home (2006), and CSI: NY (2006).[24] She also took on several contract acting and modeling jobs, including a stint as a \"briefcase girl\" on the US game show Deal or No Deal.[7] She appeared in Fox's series Fringe as Junior Agent Amy Jessup in the first two episodes of its second season.[25] Markle had some difficulty getting roles early in her career. In 2015, she wrote: \"Being 'ethnically ambiguous', as I was pegged in the industry, meant I could audition for virtually any role ... Sadly, it didn't matter: I wasn't black enough for the black roles and I wasn't white enough for the white ones, leaving me somewhere in the middle as the ethnic chameleon who couldn't book a job.\"[26]\n\nIn July 2011, Markle joined the cast of the USA Network show Suits, playing Rachel Zane. The character began as a paralegal and eventually became an attorney. She completed work on the seventh season in late 2017.[27] According to a critique in The Irish Times, Markle deftly and \"actively re-positioned\" her character from ingenue to \"the show's moral conscience\" and gave viewers the unique portrayal of a daughter, whose African-American father is in a position to help her career and advance her \"desire to crack both racial and gender glass ceilings\".[28] She appeared in two 2010 films, Get Him to the Greek and Remember Me, and one 2011 film, Horrible Bosses.[29] She also appeared in episodes of Cuts; Love, Inc.; 90210; Knight Rider; Without a Trace; The League; and Castle.[24][30]\n\nFrom 2014 to 2017, she was founder and editor-in-chief of the lifestyle website The Tig,[31][32] a name she derived from Tignanello red wine.[33] One of The Tig's features was \"Tig Talk\", a column that profiled women including Jessica Alba,[34] Gail Simmons,[35] Ella Woodward,[36] Daphne Oz,[37] Elizabeth Hurley,[38] Lauren Bush,[39] Ivanka Trump,[40] Dianna Agron[41] and Jessica Stam.[42] She closed The Tig in April 2017,[43] and in January 2018, she deleted all of her social media accounts. At the time of its closing, her Instagram account had 1.9 million followers.[44] In a statement issued by Kensington Palace, Markle thanked \"everyone who has followed her social media accounts over the years\".[45][46]\n\nIn November 2016, Markle and Canadian clothing company Reitmans released lines of women's fashion workwear and casual-wear.[47] The lines, based on her personal style, and that of her Suits character, described as \"aspirational girl next door\", quickly sold out.[44] In 2010, Markle was paid $187,000 for her role in Remember Me and $171,429 for her role in the short film The Candidate.[48] For her role on Suits, Fortune magazine estimated that Markle was paid $50,000 per episode, amounting to an annual salary of about $450,000.[49] In addition, it was estimated that as a lifestyle blogger she earned about $80,000 annually from endorsements and sponsorships.[48] In 2017, her total net worth was estimated at $5 million.[48] In 2018, she was among the nominees for the 2018 Teen Choice Awards in the category Choice Style Icon.[50]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nMarkle began a relationship with actor and producer Trevor Engelson in 2004.[51][52] They married in Ocho Rios, Jamaica, on September 10, 2011,[53] and concluded a no-fault divorce in August 2013,[54] citing irreconcilable differences.[55] Markle's subsequent relationship with celebrity chef and restaurateur Cory Vitiello lasted almost two years, ending in May 2016.[56]\n\nIn June 2016, Markle began a relationship with Prince Harry,[57][58] who was then fifth in line to the British throne.[59] His grandmother Elizabeth II is queen of the United Kingdom and 15 other Commonwealth realms, as well as Head of the Commonwealth.[60] The couple met on a blind date set up by a mutual friend.[61] In November, the British royal family's communications secretary released an official statement that addressed a \"wave of abuse and harassment\" directed toward Markle.[62] The statement described sexism, racism and defamatory stories directed at her.[63][64][65] In September 2017, they made their first public appearance together at an official royal engagement at the Invictus Games in Toronto.[66][67]\n\nWhile working on Suits, Markle lived in a rented house in the Seaton Village neighborhood of Toronto, where the show is filmed.[68] She lived in Canada for nine months each year, making a few close friends.[44] She moved out in late November 2017 after work on the seventh season had been completed.[69]\n\nRoyal marriage [ edit ]\n\nMarkle and Prince Harry attending church on Christmas Day, 2017\n\nMarkle's engagement to Prince Harry was announced on November 27, 2017 by Clarence House and Kensington Palace.[57][70] The engagement announcement prompted generally positive comment about the possible social significance of a mixed-race member of the royal family.[71] The ring Harry gave Markle was made by Cleave & Company Ltd., and consists of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from the jewellery collection of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales.[72]\n\nFollowing the engagement, Markle announced she would retire from acting,[73][74] and began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[75] In preparation for the wedding, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, baptized Markle and confirmed her into the Church of England on March 6, 2018.[76] The private ceremony, performed with water from the River Jordan, took place in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace.[76] The marriage ceremony was held on May 19, 2018, at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.[77]\n\nThe Duke and Duchess live at Nottingham Cottage in London, in the grounds of Kensington Palace.[78] They are expecting their first child, who would be seventh in line to the throne, in 2019.[79] The couple will move to Frogmore Cottage in the grounds of Windsor Castle's Home Park following the birth, but their office will continue to operate at Kensington Palace.[80][81]\n\nPublic life [ edit ]\n\nMarkle greeting the public in Belfast, March 2018\n\nMarkle accompanied Harry for the first time during an official public appearance after their engagement at a walkabout in Nottingham on December 1, 2017,[82][83] in connection with World AIDS Day.[84] The Queen invited them to celebrate Christmas with the royal family at her Sandringham estate.[85] In early 2018, Markle accompanied Harry on his engagements in Brixton,[84] Cardiff,[86] Goldsmiths' Hall,[87] and Edinburgh.[88] On February 28, Markle attended an official engagement at the first annual forum of The Royal Foundation, \"Making a Difference Together\" with the prince.[89] She became the fourth patron, alongside Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, after her marriage into the royal family.[90] Markle and Harry marked International Women's Day by attending an event in Birmingham hosted by the Stemettes.[91] Along with the Queen and other members of the royal family, she attended the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey on March 12.[92] The couple made their first visit to Northern Ireland on March 23.[93] Markle carried out a total of 26 public engagements prior to the wedding.[94]\n\nThe Duchess's first official engagement after the wedding came on May 22 when she and her husband celebrated the charity work of his father, Prince Charles.[95] Her first trip abroad at the request of the British government was to Dublin, Ireland, in July.[96][97] According to a review in The Irish Times, her visit became a unique national obsession.[98]\n\nThe Duchess takes part in her husband's work as youth ambassador to the Commonwealth, which includes overseas tours.[99] The first such trip was to Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand in October 2018.[100][101] Despite the low support for the monarchy in Australia, the couple were greeted by crowds in Sydney, and the announcement of the Duchess's pregnancy hours after arrival was enthusiastically received by the public and media.[101][102]\n\nFashion and style [ edit ]\n\nMarkle cited Emmanuelle Alt as her style inspiration in 2017.[103][104] In an interview with Glamour, the Duchess said that she favored \"that French way of styling, where if your outfit is pulled together, then something's got to be dishevelled\u2014your hair, your make-up\".[103] In her youth, Markle's \"sensibility had always been relaxed California girl style\" consisting of jeans, cut-offs and flip-flops.[104] She usually prefers \"streamlined dresses\" with \"neutral colors\" and boat-neck necklines,[105][106] and likes \"monochromatic and tonal dressing\".[104] She has worn outfits and ensembles by a wide variety of fashion designers.[103]\n\nIn December 2017, Markle caused a surge in interest in Scottish retailer Strathberry after carrying one of their handbags to a public event shortly after her engagement.[107][108] This was reported as an indication that her fashion choices would produce her own version of the Kate effect.[107][109] It has been speculated that Markle's effect would be greater, as she has a strong appeal in America.[109] After Markle and Prince Harry's first appearance as a couple, brands Mackage, Birks, R&R Jewelers, Crown Jewelers and Everlane noted an upswing in their website hits and sales.[110][111][108] In 2018, Tatler named her on its list of Britain's best dressed people, praising her for redefining \"modern royal style with every subsequent appearance\".[112] Following the announcement of her pregnancy, the Duchess of Sussex appeared in a Karen Gee dress which resulted in the breakdown of the designer's website.[113]\n\nCharity work [ edit ]\n\nMarkle was a counselor for international charity One Young World. She attended its 2014 and 2016 summits.[115] At the 2014 summit in Dublin, she spoke on the topics of gender equality and modern-day slavery.[116] Also in 2014, she traveled to Afghanistan and Spain as part of the United Service Organizations Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Holiday Tour.[117][118][119]\n\nIn 2016, Markle became a global ambassador for World Vision Canada, traveling to Rwanda for the Clean Water Campaign, the agency's campaign to provide safe, clean drinking water,[120][121][26] and she traveled to India to raise awareness of issues concerning women.[122] Upon returning from India, she penned an op-ed for Time magazine concerning stigmatization of women in regard to menstrual health.[123] She has also worked with the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women as an Advocate.[120][124] The Duchess is a vocal feminist and likely to use her role as a member of the royal family to continue supporting women's rights and social justice.[125]\n\nIn September 2018, the Duchess announced her support for a charity cookbook (for which she wrote the Foreword) titled Together: Our Community Cookbook.[126][127] The book, which is written by women from the Grenfell community, features recipes from around the world.[128] Meghan, who has regularly visited the Hubb Community Kitchen since January 2018,[128] said in a statement: \"Through this charitable endeavour, the proceeds will allow the kitchen to thrive and keep the global spirit of community alive.\"[126]\n\nIn 2018, Time magazine included Markle on its list of the 100 Most Influential People in the World, and placed her on its shortlist for Person of the Year.[129][130][131] She was also chosen as one of the most influential women in the United Kingdom by Vogue magazine.[132]\n\nTitles, styles, and arms [ edit ]\n\nTitles and styles [ edit ]\n\nRoyal monogram\n\nUpon her marriage to Prince Harry, Meghan Markle became a princess of the United Kingdom entitled to the style of Royal Highness, as well as Duchess of Sussex, Countess of Dumbarton and Baroness Kilkeel.[133][134] She is styled as \"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex\",[135] and she is the first person to hold that title.[136]\n\nArms [ edit ]\n\nAncestry [ edit ]\n\nOn her mother's side, the Duchess of Sussex is descended from African Americans enslaved in Georgia,[140] and on her father's side from German,[141] English,[142] and Irish settlers.[143] One of her possible forefathers, Heinrich Martin Merckel, emigrated to the United States from Lampertsloch, an historically German-speaking town in Alsace, and later changed the spelling of his name to Markle.[141] Among her father's distant ancestors are Captain Christopher Hussey, King Robert I of Scotland, Sir Philip Wentworth, and Edward III of England.[144][145]\n\nFilmography [ edit ]\n\nTelevision [ edit ]\n\nFilm [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]"}
{"label": true, "txt": "Shonda Rhimes' Scandal will come to an end next year, according to a report from TVLine. The series, which is part of ABC's popular T.G.I.T Thursday night lineup, has been a hit for the network and has helped secure Rhimes' dominance and make a big name out of star Kerry Washington, who plays Washington D.C.'s \"fixer\" Olivia Pope.\n\nThis should not come as a huge surprise to big Shondaland fans, as Rhimes herself said that the show would have a shorter shelf life than her original hit, Grey's Anatomy, which is now in its 13th season. \"I feel like there is a finite amount of Scandal to be told,\" she told NPR in 2013. \"So I know what the end of Scandal will be, and I feel really good about that. And I can see where the end point is.\"\n\nThus the show's conclusion was the decision of Rhimes, not the network. Among the advertiser-coveted 18 to 49 demographic, the show was among the 20 highest-rated shows of 2016. The current season averages 5.699 million viewers and 1.46 viewers in the 18-49 demo. While this marks a drop from the fifth season's average of 7.18 million viewers, the current live number is impressive considering the steady decline of live-viewership. Scandal remains one of ABC's most popular series and a large reason why the network routinely beats the other broadcasters on Thursday nights.\n\nThese ratings, of course, have allowed the network to pull in a hefty amount in ad revenue. At its peak, Scandal was part of a Thursday night block that brought ABC over half a billion dollars. In 2016, Scandal brought in $75 million for ABC--more than How to Get Away with Murder or The Catch, according to iSpot.tv.\n\n\"What Shonda Rhimes possesses is this extraordinary instinct and compass for what our audience needs,\" then-president of ABC Entertainment group Paul Lee told FORBES in 2013. \"That Shonda is free and has a huge amount of power to pursue her vision is precisely how the magic happens.\"\n\nThe network isn't the only beneficiary of Scandal's popularity. The show's stars have risen to prominence--and their wallets have grown--with the series. Washington routinely lands high on Forbes' list of highest-paid TV actresses. Last year, she pulled in $12 million, with about half of that coming from her salary from the show. Being on the show has made her well-known enough to land lucrative endorsement deals with the likes of Neutrogena and a commercial with Apple Music.\n\nAs a black lead on a broadcast series, Washington's star turn has also brought much-needed diversity to prime time. After the success of Scandal, Rhimes brought another African American woman--Viola Davis, the first black woman to ever win the Emmy for Best Lead Actress in a Drama--to the limelight on How to Get Away with Murder. On broadcast TV, only 22.6% of series regulars are of underrepresented racial minorities according to the 2016 Annenberg report on diversity. In dramas, like Scandal, this percentage drops. Unfortunately, that means two dramas with black leads is a big deal for the industry.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always room for our film and television, for our art, to be more representative of who we are as a culture.

{"label": true, "txt": "\u201cThe Flash\u201d returns this week after a month-long hiatus with Barry (Grant Gustin) making a dangerous play to learn the identity of Savitar.\n\nAfter an encounter with future villain Abra Kadabra (David Dastmalchian) \u2014 who not only knew a future version of Flash, but also who Savitar was \u2014 Barry decides the best way to learn more about the God of Speed is to head to the future himself. On top of all that, Caitlin (Danielle Panabaker) has succumbed to her Killer Frost persona and is on the run. All of this is juggled by first-time \u201cFlash\u201d director, and series\u2019 star, Tom Cavanagh.\n\nVariety spoke with Cavanagh \u2014 who has played three separate versions of the same character across the show\u2019s three seasons; currently H.R. Wells, and previously Harry Wells and Harrison Wells \u2014 about directing different versions of the main characters, how being behind the camera this time differed from his previous directing gigs, and more.\n\nHow did directing an episode come about? Was it something you wanted to do or did they approach you about it?\n\nGenerally, when I am signing a contract for a television series, we have a handshake deal in there about directing. This is my third show for Greg Berlanti, and they sort of know I like to direct. In the past the stuff that I\u2019ve done seems to have been well-enough received that it allowed me to forge forth.\n\nRelated 'Elseworlds, Part 1' Recap: Barry Allen and Oliver Queen Swap Skills, Visit Superman Flash Standalone Movie Pushes Start Date, Eyes 2021 Release (EXCLUSIVE)\n\nDid you know when you said you\u2019d direct that it would be this big Barry-heads-to-the-future episode?\n\nThey do a ridiculous amount of episodes of \u201cFlash\u201d every year. \u201cThe Flash\u201d is one of the most prepared television shows I\u2019ve ever been on, and for the amount of work that comes through the pipeline they are incredibly on top of it. As a director \u2014 I\u2019ve been on shows where the director gets the script on the first day of shooting \u2014 they will get a script for the entire length of the prep. It gives you a fighting chance.\n\nIn terms of what the actual story is going to be, they\u2019ve got a story arc when they start the season but you don\u2019t really know where your story is going to fall. I feel very fortunate to deal with Barry \u2026 dealing with Barry. That\u2019s two versions of Grant Gustin, which is phenomenal. I was grateful to have this storyline.\n\nYou\u2019re no stranger of playing multiple versions of the same character, or acting opposite yourself. Was it fun directing altered, future versions of the other characters?\n\nThat\u2019s part of the aspect of this episode that I really, really liked. We see a whole different world. We got to mess some stuff up. I\u2019ve played five or six or seven different versions of myself since the show started but most of the cast has just played one or two versions of their character. In this one, I think it was great for them to pull out of the hat another version of themselves. I think both Grant and Carlos Valdes in particular were exceptional in this episode. They\u2019re very talented to begin with, but then you add these different layers you kind of marvel at their abilities.\n\nHow is it to direct yourself?\n\nI always find it\u2019s really good. If you write something and you have the visual of that in your head, I don\u2019t have to convince the actor \u2014 or even explain to the actor \u2014 what the visual is. So I can accommodate however I want. One thing I will say, though, if anyone is going to get short-changed when I\u2019m directing it\u2019s not going to be the other actors; it\u2019s going to be me. You become much less self-indulgent.\n\n\u201cThe Flash\u201d airs on the CW on Tuesdays at 8 p.m."}
{"label": true, "txt": "Kylie Jenner, being normal.\n\nDolls, it\u2019s nearing the end. With just one more week until the finale of Life of Kylie, let\u2019s savor all the moments we have alone with our star. #LEGGO!\n\nScene 1\n\nIn this, the penultimate episode of E!\u2019s situational dramedy Life of Kylie, the producers are still reaching for nuggets of Kylie\u2019s life that have remained untouched by gossip outlets and Keeping Up With the Kardashians. A hardworking producer asks Kylie to tell the cameras something no one knows about her. Kylie\u2019s response? She eats shrimp tacos every day. Following a recipe she learned from Karrueche Tran, Kylie (who\u2019s now vegan) apparently serves up a plate of tacos for herself, daily. With this admission coming so late in the season, it\u2019s a shame we couldn\u2019t have spent at least one episode investigating whether or not Kylie has mercury poisoning. Kylie\u2019s shocking dietary admission was filmed on April 24, 2017.\n\nWhat she should have filmed: Kylie\u2019s current cosmetics rival, Rihanna, had beef with Kylie all the way back on April 24. You see, the kind souls of the internet discovered that Rihanna, Travis Scott\u2019s ex, didn\u2019t feel great about Scott\u2019s current relationship with Kylie Jenner. On the 24th of April, it was reported that Ms. Fenty found their relationship to be \u201ctasteless,\u201d much like the tacos Kylie\u2019s eating (the only seasoning in sight is Old Bay). Between bites, I\u2019m sure Kylie had a lot to say about Rihanna\u2019s comments \u2014 but I\u2019ll give her production team the benefit of the doubt and assume her mic was just turned off.\n\nPhoto: E!\n\nScene 2\n\nAt her \u201ctherapist\u2019s\u201d office, Kylie talks to an unseen woman about the evolution of her lips. Kylie\u2019s always been shy about that part of her appearance, and, as it turns out, one of her first kisses really drove the issue home. After kissing a boy as a teen, Kylie remembers him being shocked that she could kiss so well, considering the thinness of her lips. That really heightened Kylie\u2019s insecurity, so she started overlining her lips in the hopes that it would make her feel \u201cdesirable and pretty.\u201d Once the lip liner stopped cutting it she got them plumped up. This lip-themed scene was filmed on April 6, 2017.\n\nWhat she should have filmed: Kylie\u2019s session was filmed right in the thick of Kylie\u2019s relationship transition. Reports that she and permanent renter Tyga had split were out in the world, and she wasn\u2019t publicly dating Travis Scott. With room for anything to happen, rumors spread that Kris Jenner was trying to set up her youngest child with Drake. I mean, if I were Kylie, I\u2019d be telling my therapist that I currently feel my most \u201cdesirable and pretty,\u201d considering someone wanted to set me up with a man with immediate name recognition.\n\nPhoto: E!\n\nScene 4\n\nProfessional family member and Lip Kit entrepreneur Kylie is seeking to add philanthropist to her credits! She\u2019s almost there, but needs to cement her status. So she\u2019s traveling to Peru to check out the Smile Train, an organization that she and Kylie Cosmetics have been supporting. Last year, Kylie debuted a Lip Kit named \u201cSmile,\u201d which was sold exclusively to support Smile Train\u2019s mission, which is providing reconstructive surgeries to children with cleft lips in Peru. Kris is also joining Kylie on the trip \u2014 easy enough since Kylie, Best Friend Jordyn, and Assistant Victoria are all ready to fly from Los Angeles to Peru as a group. However, Kylie sends Victoria into a panic when she asks her assistant to ask Kris if it\u2019s okay for the plane to pick up Kylie and Jordyn in Miami before heading to Peru. Victoria refuses to ask Kris herself, convincing Kylie that it will of course be better coming from her. Kylie\u2019s hesitant and admits she\u2019s scared of her mother. Still, she calls \u2014 and after some convincing, Kris agrees. This scene was filmed on May 26, 2017, almost three weeks after their trip to Peru on May 7.\n\nWhat she should have filmed: Instead of making sure their acting muscles worked on one another, Kris and Kylie should have had a frank conversation over FaceTime about Scott Disick prancing around Cannes with Kylie\u2019s former friend Bella Thorne on his arm. Screw lying about on a plane to Miami, these two should have hopped a plane to France and really shook down the father of three and Disney star!\n\nPhoto: E!\n\nPhoto: E!\n\nPhoto: E!\n\nScene 5\n\nAn anxious Victoria shares a plane to Miami with Kris Jenner, who is none too pleased with Kylie. Kris appreciates that Kylie is out in the world having fun and dating, but she also thinks she needs to focus on her real goal: Being Kylie Jenner. Victoria agrees, but tries to remember that Kylie is only 19 (and is responsible \u201cin her own way\u201d). After one-on-one critiquing their child and boss, Kris and Victoria land in Miami. Kylie and Jordyn look exactly like two teens who spent the weekend partying in Miami would, and as a special gift to Kris, it\u2019s mentioned that Kylie made sure to make out on the hood of her car with Travis before boarding. The hits don\u2019t stop coming: Just as everyone\u2019s getting settled, Jordyn realizes she doesn\u2019t have her passport. Kris actually requests someone to \u201cshoot\u201d her, but thankfully no one has to once Jordyn finally finds her passport deep in a bag. This scene was filmed on May 7, 2017.\n\nWhat she should have filmed: While Kris and Victoria were chopping it up on a private jet, Kylie and Jordyn were busy having the time of their little underage lives in Miami. Of course, Kylie\u2019s secret trip was with Travis, a man we\u2019re still begging to see on our television screens. I would argue that we as a viewing community have been put through hell while being forced to watch Tyga on Keeping Up With the Kardashians \u2014 at the very least we deserve to enjoy moments with an actually talented person!\n\nPhoto: E!\n\nPhoto: E!\n\nScene 6 and Scene 7\n\nJust hours after landing in Peru, Kris invites Kylie and Jordyn to join her at a Michelin-starred restaurant in Lima with the Smile Train crew. The girls are reluctant to attend because they don\u2019t have any fancy clothes, and have settled on a bun-and-no-makeup look for the day. Kris forces them to go, and while she waits for them to drag their feet out the door, she comments on how messy their room got in just a matter of hours. Kylie rolls her eyes at her mother\u2019s shock, and in her confessional she tells the cameras that she\u2019s not like either of her parents or even Kendall. Kylie blames it on the fact that she\u2019s a Leo and her parents and sister are all Scorpios, signs that notoriously do not get along.\n\nThe group finally makes it to the restaurant, where Kris yet again forces Kylie and Jordyn to do something they don\u2019t want to do: take a photo with the chefs. The girls forget a smize and go straight for a frown in the pictures, and keep that attitude throughout the whole meal. Kylie and Jordyn aren\u2019t fond of the experimental food (which they compare to rocks) so they refuse to eat. Kylie asks her mom if she can leave, and Kris looks around at all of the other guests from the organization Kylie is there to promote and between her smiling teeth tells Kylie to \u201cplay ball, kid.\u201d Kylie doesn\u2019t want to play, so she and Jordyn pretend to get up to go to the bathroom and ditch the dinner. Kylie and Jordyn\u2019s poor behavior was filmed on May 8, 2017.\n\nWhat she should have filmed: I\u2019d like to think that Kylie and Jordyn were such sour pusses during their meal with the Smile Train workers because Kylie was upset over being cropped out of Diddy\u2019s Met Ball photo. It\u2019s possible Kylie felt like she couldn\u2019t catch a break or real meal so she was acting out. Still, it would have been easier to digest seeing Kylie throw a tantrum over an Instagram snub instead of Peruvian food.\n\nPhoto: E!\n\nPhoto: E!\n\nPhoto: E!\n\nScene 8\n\nThe following day, Kylie, Kris, Jordyn, and Victoria head to the Smile Train facilities, where children have surgeries performed on their cleft lips. Before entering the hospital, the group tours the gift shop and marvels at statues that seem to be performing sexual acts. At the hospital, a little baby named Mia is headed into surgery. Kris and Kylie head in with her, and watch from the wings. Overcome with emotion for both Mia and her mom, who was very anxious for the surgery, Kylie\u2019s grateful that she can help so many children and admits that any insecurities she has pale in comparison to their struggles. This scene was filmed on May 8, 2017.\n\nWhat she should have filmed: On May 8, even though she was all the way in Peru, Jordyn was facing one of her first Photoshop fail nightmares. After posting a photo from her and Kylie\u2019s Miami trip, the internet happily dragged Jordyn for appearing to have Photoshopped her shins in a photo with Kylie. A suspicious curve in the carpet is what gave her away. In my personal opinion, it would have been productive for Jordyn to work through her emotions over being caught Photoshopping while on camera, especially after visiting the Smile Train facilities.\n\nPhoto: E!\n\nPhoto: E!\n\nPhoto: E!\n\nScene 9\n\nFollowing their successful visit to the Smile Train, Kylie and Kris treat themselves to an intimate dinner. Kris is emotional, and tells Kylie that she\u2019s worried about her. Kylie\u2019s mom thinks she\u2019s running herself ragged jumping from city to city, and she should focus more on managing her business and brand. Kylie doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s doing anything wrong, since she just wants to be a normal 19-year-old who makes mistakes. That\u2019s all it takes for a teary-eyed Kris to back down, and she tells Kylie that she\u2019s the perfect \u201cspokesperson\u201d for her generation. Kylie agrees. This scene was filmed on May 11, 2017.\n\nWhat she should have filmed: It\u2019s always great to see a mother and daughter bond, but ideally we would have heard Kylie\u2019s opinions on the never-ending Caitlyn Jenner drama within her family. On the 11th of May, it was reported that Brody Jenner was strictly Team Caitlyn and was pretty disgusted with the Kardashians\u2019 treatment of her during and after her transition, particularly Kim\u2019s current vow of silence against Cait. We know that both Kylie and Kendall support both of their parents, but since they\u2019re rarely seen interacting with their Jenner siblings, it wouldn\u2019t hurt to get an update on those relationships.\n\nPhoto: E!\n\nPhoto: E!\n\nScene 10\n\nIn the final scene of the night, Kylie and Kris visit little Mia after her surgery. All is well with the child and her family, but Kris and Kylie are still emotional. Kris cries just looking at Mia, while Kylie asks the infant if she\u2019ll even remember her. Mia doesn\u2019t respond, so Kylie and Kris head out to take some photos. This scene was like Scene 8, and filmed on May 9, 2017.\n\nWhat they should have filmed: I truly love seeing Kylie being one with the people and doing house calls, but I know the only thing on her mind was jetting out of Peru to have some real fun. In fact, on that very day, Kylie\u2019s sister Kendall and dear friend Bella Hadid were currently in Mexico jet-skiing for their lives! How beautiful would it have been to have the episode come full circle with Kylie asking Kris to drop her off in Mexico before landing in L.A.?\n\nPhoto: E!\n\nPhoto: E!\n\nAll right, Dolls, don\u2019t miss me next week for the final Life of Kylie Minus Kylie\u2019s Real Life recap! I know it\u2019s sad, but don\u2019t think of this as the end, think of this as one step closer to Keeping Up With the Kardashians! #BRINGBACKKEEPINGUPNOW"}

{"label": true, "txt": "Kelis, Nas' Ex-Wife, Accuses Rapper Of Physical And Mental Abuse\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for Spotify Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images for Spotify\n\nFor nearly a decade, singer and celebrity chef Kelis kept the details surrounding her divorce from the rap artist Nas private. But in a new video interview with Hollywood Unlocked, she describes their high-profile celebrity marriage of five years as a \"tumultuous and toxic\" relationship in which she suffered both mental and physical abuse.\n\n\"I have edited myself for nine years and I woke up this morning and said, 'not today,' \" Kelis says during the nearly two-hour interview recorded at her home.\n\nA representative for Nas did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nYouTube\n\nWhen the couple married in 2005, Nas's status as one of the greatest rappers alive and Kelis's genre-bending musical repertoire made them instant hip-hop royalty in the public eye. Yet the fairy-tale was far from reality, Kelis claims. She describes a marriage in which they fought frequently, with Nas often drinking to the point of being black-out drunk before becoming violent toward her. Kelis would fight back in self-defense, she says, and Nas would often wake up with no memory of the events. \"Literally, we would have the worst night ever and we would wake up the next day, and it's like it never happened.\"\n\nHer revelations come amid the backdrop of #MeToo, a movement whose greater reckoning around sexual assault, harassment and violence against women has yet to make a dent in hip-hop, despite its tangled, misogynist history. Russell Simmons, the godfather of the rap industry, has been the subject of multiple allegations of sexual assault and harassment over the past year; one of two assault cases filed against Simmons was dropped earlier this week. But the music industry, and hip-hop in particular, has yet to face the wide-scale scrutiny that has hit Hollywood head-on.\n\nIn one grim account, Kelis recalls feeling empathy for Rihanna when details emerged of her abuse at the hands of Chris Brown because she found herself in the same predicament. \"I remember so clearly when the pictures came out with that whole thing that happened with her and Chris Brown. And the only way I can describe it was like double-dutch. I felt like, 'Do I jump in? Do I say it?' Cause I had bruises all over my body at that time,\" she says. \"That day, I remember being in Atlanta sitting in the kitchen and I wasn't ready to walk.\"\n\nBy the time she filed for divorce over \"irreconcilable differences\" in April 2009, Nas had been cheating for two years, she alleges, in addition to the domestic abuse. Pregnant with their son Knight at the time, she gave birth in July. In less than a year, their divorce was finalized.\n\nOn the cover photo of Nas' 2012 album Life Is Good, the artist is seated with part of his ex-wife's green wedding dress draped over his leg. It was left behind when they split, he said in interviews at the time of the album's release. Nas has never acknowledged physical abuse and has yet to respond publicly to Kelis's new allegations.\n\nIt's not the first time Nas has been the subject of such accusations. In her 2006 tell-all book It's No Secret, Carmen Bryan, the mother of Nas' daughter Destiny Jones, wrote: \"The next thing I knew I was being hit in the face with a closed fist,\" detailing what happened the morning after she came home and Nas noticed a hickey on her neck. \"The impact of the blow was so fierce that I saw stars.\"\n\nKelis's interview comes in the wake of the latest filing by Nas in the protracted custody battle over their eight-year-old son, which provoked her to speak out, she says. \"I'm really private; I don't like people in my business,\" Kelis says, explaining why she stayed quiet during their marriage. \"I felt like, 'This is my partner; I chose this. We're gonna do this. We're gonna make it work.' I stayed for years after that, and you keep it moving. Like I said, I'm not frail, I'm not scared, I'm not weak.\""}

Carlos), the wide-eyed baby boy who tags along with Zach Galifianakis, Bradley Cooper and Ed Helms in Las Vegas.\n\nAnd there\u2019s no mistaking him four years later in The Hangover Part III, in theaters Friday.\n\n\u201cThe cheeks kinda give it away, right?\u201d his mom, Carrie Holmquist, jokes to PEOPLE. In honor of the third installment (the last of the series, promises director Todd Phillips), we give you a trio of little known, fun facts about the littlest member of the franchise.\n\n1. HE WAS SURROUNDED BY THE LADIES IN VEGAS\n\nLittle ladies, that is. In the first movie, the role of Tyler/Carlos was primarily played by Grant, secondarily by his twin sister Avery, along with six other babies \u2013 all girls. After some early scheduling trouble, the Holmquist twins signed on for the film. \u201cWe started shooting in Vegas and it was the pool scene, which was fun,\u201d says Carrie. \u201cThey had shot for two days prior to us getting there, so there are a couple clips in that movie where it\u2019s not Grant or Avery.\u201d Otherwise, it\u2019s about \u201c60 percent Grant, 40 percent Avery,\u201d says their mom.\n\nZach Galifianakis and Grant Holmquist in The Hangover Warner Bros.\n\nFor the third installment, Grant won the role despite the initial call for 6-year-old child actors (he was 4-and-a-half when they filmed Part III) with an older understudy in place in case \u201che had a meltdown on set,\u201d jokes Carrie. (No spoilers here, but Grant\u2019s scene opposite Galifianakis in the latest installment is a scream.)\n\n2. HE LOVES ZACH GALIFIANAKIS\n\nCooper and Helms hung out with Grant between takes, but it was his scene partner, Galifianakis, who really stood out to the young actor. \u201cZach did an amazing job loosening Grant up,\u201d says his mom. \u201cHe\u2019s the type of kid who\u2019s very analytical and intelligent. So he kind of walks into a room and takes it all in first so it was really nice to have those personalities warm up to him.\u201d Today, \u201cWhen he sees him in the trailer or in the paper, he\u2019ll go, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s Zachy!\u2019 He\u2019s taken to calling him Zachy,\u201d says Carrie. \u201cGrant loves him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe got to do a promotional photo shoot and that was an interesting day as well,\u201d says Carrie. \u201cWe were just lounging at the studio waiting for Grant\u2019s turn and there\u2019s Bradley on one couch and John Goodman walks by and Ken Jeong and I had a great heart to heart. He\u2019s a physician and has twins, too. Just nice, nice people.\u201d\n\n3. AND HE REALLY DIGS YODA\n\nIn addition to playing soccer and loving his Legos, Grant \u201chas an infatuation with Yoda,\u201d says Carrie. \u201cHe was interested in finding out how he uses his light saber \u2026 but what Grant really likes about him is that he\u2019s wise. It really resonates with him that Yoda tries to reason with people first, the idea of using the force and being a great Jedi. I thought that was so cool, for a four-and-a-half year old to realize that. He\u2019s pretty amazing.\u201d\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more."}

She posted videos of her and The Weeknd as they walked past an art installation.\n\nThe Weeknd was featured in the last one on her Instagram story and she captioned it, \"muse forever.\" If that doesn't mean their back together, then we don't know what does.\n\nInstagram\n\n5. They were spotted together in Tokyo.\n\nIt looks like it's finally happening as the couple were spotted taking in the sights in Tokyo, Japan together. Fans took videos of Bella and The Weeknd as they walked out of a store and checked out arcades throughout Tokyo.\n\n7/21/18: Video of Bella Hadid and Abel Tesfaye out in Tokyo, Japan. pic.twitter.com/ZdFEgebDMN \u2014 Bella Hadid Daily (@BellaHadidDaily) July 21, 2018\n\n7/22/18: Video of Bella and The Weeknd out in Tokyo. pic.twitter.com/e9zJPHGltE \u2014 Bella Hadid Daily (@BellaHadidDaily) July 22, 2018\n\nThey don't seem to be hiding their rekindled relationship after The Weeknd posted a video featuring Bella on his Instagram story.\n\nBella on The Weeknd's Instagram stories. pic.twitter.com/zfovpeSt8Z \u2014 Bella Hadid Daily (@BellaHadidDaily) July 22, 2018\n\nBella still hasn't featured The Weeknd on her page, but it's only a matter of time before she confirms they're back together again.\n\n6. Bella Posted The Weeknd's Lyrics on Instagram\n\nIt looks like Bella just can't get The Weekend out of her mind and it's even more obvious after she posted a new photo of herself from her trip to Italy with some of his lyrics.\n\nThe lyrics \"as long as u know that when I land ur mine\" are from his song \"Pretty\" from his first album, Kiss Land.\n\nIt looks like The Weekend enjoyed the throwback lyrics from his ex as he liked the photo, even though he doesn't currently follow her on Instagram.\n\nInstagram\n\nIt looks like The Weeknd took back the like as it seems like his like doesn't appear anymore, even after searching through the photos likes. What's more interesting though is how he found the photo in the first place. Looks like The Weeknd might be looking at Bella's page more than he would like us to think.\n\n7. Bella and The Weeknd spend a few days cuddled up inside his mansion.\n\nYou don't need to be in the CIA to solve this mystery: Where did Bella Hadid and Abel spend a recent weekend? Well, they spent it together at his mansion, of course! How do we know? Instagram tells no lies.\n\nAbel posted a pic of him standing on the balcony of his stunning mansion with his two dogs looking up lovingly at him. Obvi, this pic is too far away to be taken from a selfie stick.\n\nSo who was behind the camera for this shot?\n\nWell, that answer became obvious once you meandered over to Bella's IG account where she shared a zoomed out version of the same image on her IG stories. Her only addition to the pic: A tiny black heart emoji placed in the center of all the action.\n\nInstagram\n\n8. They went on an official date months ago.\n\nNothing makes it seems like you're back with ex quite like when you're spotted out on a date with them. And the former couple didn't just go for any old dinner date. They went on a dinner date in PARIS, the most romantic city in the world (or so I've heard). A fan took a photo of them at a small restaurant having drinks. Bella couldn't help but beam at The Weeknd. But the creeping fan wasn't the only person to capture the moment. The Weeknd himself shared an Instagram story during their date time.\n\nAnd if you thought that was enough for you to hop aboard the Abella ship, then you'll be happy to know that the two were photographed by paparazzi cuddling in the street. So cute!\n\n9. They totally made out in public.\n\nYour reunion dreams came true in the form of a make-out sesh during a party yesterday in Cannes, France. The two were photographed kissing at the Magnum party and generally being cuddly all night.\n\nSPLASH NEWS\n\nPics show the pair close-talking.\n\nSPLASH NEWS\n\nSPLASH NEWS\n\nOne even captures Bella affectionately touching Abel's face.\n\nSPLASH NEWS\n\nDo you think she's grabbing his face to kiss him again? Or maybe she's just teasing him about something? Whatever the reason, the two certainly look VERY comfortablee touching each other.\n\n10. Their Cannes hang-out went WELL into the evening hours.\n\nE! reports that the couple was photographed leaving together. What do you think that means, huh?\n\n11. Bella and The Weeknd have been secretly hanging out recently.\n\nThis isn't the first time a rumored reunion has come to light. E! reported last month that Hadid and The Weeknd had been \"secretly seeing each other recently\" but weren't official. \"They are just getting back to a good place,\" a source told the outlet. \"She loves hanging out with Abel and they always have fun together and is very hopeful of their future relationship.\"\n\n12. They were totally spotted kissing at Coachella.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, reports came out saying that Bella and The Weeknd were spotted kissing at Coachella, but Bella quickly squashed those comments. On E! News' Instagram post about the rumored smooch, she commented a simple, \"It wasn\u2019t me.\"\n\nInstagrams\n\nUs Weekly originally reported that The Weeknd and Bella \"were completely all over each other\" at the festival. People said they were \"sitting on each other\u2019s laps and all over each other all night long.\"\n\n13. Bella kept her eye on Abel while he was dating Selena Gomez.\n\nRight after The Weeknd and Selena broke up, there was all that stuff with someone who looked like Bella on a Victoria's Secret flight lurking on IG pics of Abe the babe.\n\n14. The Weeknd's song \"Wasted Times\" is likely about Bella.\n\nWhen The Weeknd's song came out, people were CONVINCED that it was all about his relationship with Bella. There's one lyric in particular that seems to point to Bella. \u201cYou were equestrian, so ride it like a champion,\" he sings in the song. Bella is an accomplished equestrian. Interestingggggg.\n\nIn the song, he also sings about \"reminiscin' how you felt.\" Then, he goes off about feeling jealous...\n\n\"And now I'm askin', who do you belong to now?\n\nWho you give that love to now?\n\nWho you pullin' up on?\n\nWho you gettin' sprung for now?\n\nAnd what they got that I ain't got?\n\n'Cause I got a lot\"\n\nLooks like Bella and The Weeknd 2.0 is seriously in the works."}

This transition will provide greater flexibility for touring artists, eliminate the possibility of invalid ballots, and protect further against fraudulent voting.\n\nAll music creators, including songwriters, producers, engineers, mixers, mastering engineers and featured artists, which are credited with at least 33 percent or more playing time on the winning album will be eligible to receive a Grammy in the Album of the Year category. This is the first time songwriters are recognized in this category.\n\nFrom this year on, Nominations Review Committees will be created and implemented for the Rap, Contemporary Instrumental, and New Age Fields.\n\nFrom this year, the definition of Album is expanded in Classical, Dance, And Jazz Fields. To be eligible for Grammy consideration, an album must comprise a minimum total playing time of 15 minutes with at least five distinct tracks or a minimum total playing time of 30 minutes with no minimum track requirement.\n\nAn exception on the rule of only one version of a song allowed to enter in the Grammy Awards nomination process will be made in the Best Song Written for Visual Media category, allowing the film version of a track to be entered in the category, even if a different version of the track is submitted in other categories. In the Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media category, eligibility guidelines have been amended to require soundtrack albums for a documentary or biopic to contain 51 percent or more of newly recorded music.\n\nNew York as a Host City [ edit ]\n\nThe 60th Annual Grammy Awards marked the first time since 2003 that the ceremony was held in New York City. The Staples Center in Los Angeles had been the home of the Grammys since 2000. The 2003 ceremony was also held at New York City's Madison Square Garden. The fifteen-year gap between the 2003 and 2018 Grammys in New York marked the longest period of time New York went without hosting the awards.\n\nWith the main telecast being held at Madison Square Garden, the premiere ceremony (also known as the Pre-Telecast) was held at the Hulu Theater.\n\nThe MusiCares Person of the Year tribute is typically held at the Los Angeles Convention Center two days prior to the Grammys, but since the 2018 Grammy Awards were held in New York, the MusiCares tribute was held at Radio City Music Hall.\n\nControversy and cost overruns [ edit ]\n\nHosting the Grammy Awards in New York City resulted in the Grammy Awards costing more to organize as costs associated with hosting it in Los Angeles are significantly less. The awards cost $8 million more to host in New York City. The host committee that the city assembled failed to raise the money that they had initially promised. The MusiCares Person of the Year tribute which the Barclays Center (which is operated by AEG) was hoping to host ended up being held at Radio City Music Hall, which is owned by The Madison Square Garden Company. MusiCares funds which were intended for charitable purposes were instead used to pay for the $8 million cost overruns associated with hosting the Grammys in New York City.[17][18]\n\nDana Tomarken, the former Executive VP of MusiCares claims that Recording Academy President Neil Portnow directed these funds away from MusiCares to pay for the cost-overruns. In May 2018, Portnow announced his resignation from the Recording Academy which will be effective in July 2019. Dana Tomarken had been negotiating a deal to have the MusiCares Person of the Year tribute to Fleetwood Mac to be held at the Barclays Center, but Portnow decided to have it at Radio City Music Hall, without consulting Tomarken. Irving Azoff who heads Azoff MSG Entertainment (which is affiliated with The Madison Square Garden Company) informed her of this change rather than Portnow consulting her first. Tomarken has since made a claim of wrongful termination.[19]\n\nOn June 4, 2018, the mayor's office weighed in on the controversy, saying their position was always to be \"venue neutral\" and denied any involvement in the venue controversy. The Barclays Center notified City Hall of their interest in being involved with Grammy week and Julie Menin (the New York City Commissioner for the Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment) passed that information along to Grammy organizers.[20]\n\nOn June 5, 2018, an independent investigation was launched to examine the claims made by Dana Tomarken. The investigation will examine the MusiCares Person of the Year tribute as well as sexual harassment allegations.[21]\n\nRatings [ edit ]\n\nThe show was moved to January to avoid competing with the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, as was the case in 2010 and 2014. Viewership for the ceremony dropped 24% compared to the previous year, obtaining the smallest audience in the show's history in the key demographic.[citation needed]"}

I learnt early on to shut things off so those things didn\u2019t come my way.\u201d\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nShe added, \u201cI only heard what Harvey wanted people to hear, and that made me so f\u2014\u2014 angry. People would say, \u2018Well, you know how she got that role? She f\u2014\u2013 Harvey.\u2019 I would say, \u2018Shut the f\u2014 up. You don\u2019t know that.\u2019 Then, later, to find out that woman was brutally attacked \u2026 They didn\u2019t sleep with Harvey. Harvey wanted you to think that.\u201d\n\nWeinstein\u2019s attorney Benjamin Brafman responded to the actress\u2019s comments with a statement: \u201cBy her own admission, Harvey Weinstein never had an unpleasant interaction with Sandra Bullock. Indeed, from a review of her correspondence with Mr. Weinstein, it would appear that she had a warm pleasant relationship with him and even his daughter going back many years. Accordingly, with all due respect to Ms Bullock, it is not right for her to take unproven \u2018allegations\u2019 and republicize them in an effort to deprive Mr Weinstein of due process and possibly a fair trial that every citizen in this great country is entitled to. In America, the presumption of \u2018innocence\u2019 is supposed to have meaning. When piling on becomes the norm simply because it seems to be the politically correct or fashionable thing to do, we all lose, including Ms Bullock.\u201d\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for Weinstein, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by over 60 women, previously told PEOPLE in a statement that \u201cany allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances.\u201d\n\nAfter women began speaking out about their alleged experiences with Weinstein, Bullock said she became \u201creally, really scared\u201d about the consequences these \u201cbrave people\u201d might suffer for coming forward.\n\nSandra Bullock. Dave Benett/WireImage\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Oh my God, this is amazing, but f\u2014, f\u2014, f\u2014, what if it doesn\u2019t work? Please God, let it not swing the other way.\u2019 We\u2019re in such uncharted territory right now. I\u2019ve seen a lot of fear and a lot of men of a certain generation not understanding,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI saw a tremendous amount of fear from men on set,\u201d she continued, without naming any specific movie. \u201cIn the end, I said, \u2018I know you\u2019re scared, but I feel safe, so you can make some jokes now. But if you cross the line, I will f\u2014 you up.\u2019 \u201c\n\nBullock said that earlier in her career she had used her humor to deflect unwanted advances. \u201cThat\u2019s how I\u2019ve always navigated tricky situations. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve survived. Because very early on in my career I had a situation on a film, which was hard. It came from a person of authority. I kept deflecting it with humor and it didn\u2019t work. Finally, I said, \u2018Please just fire me.\u2019 \u201c\n\nShe did not name the person of authority or the film in question.\n\nRELATED: Movie Mogul Harvey Weinstein Surrenders to Authorities on Rape Charges\n\n\u201cIt was a lesson. After that, I tended to remove anything that could be misconstrued as sexual. I locked it down,\u201d she explained.\n\nMeanwhile, Weinstein pleaded not guilty earlier this month to multiple sexual assault charges \u2014 including rape \u2014 brought against him in New York City. The criminal sex act charge is in connection with an alleged 2004 sexual assault on aspiring actress Lucia Evans, police sources previously confirmed to PEOPLE. (Evans has agreed to be publicly named).\n\nWeinstein is scheduled to return to court on Sept. 22 for a hearing on motions in his case, according to N.Y.C. prosecutors.\n\nHis lawyer Benjamin Brafman said in a statement last week that he was not surprised by the indictment, noting that it \u201cdoes not add anything to the case we did not already know.\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Weinstein intends to \u2026 vigorously defend against these unsupported allegations that he strongly denies,\u201d Brafman said. \u201cWe will soon formally move to dismiss the indictment and if this case actually proceeds to trial, we expect Mr. Weinstein to be acquitted.\u201d\n\nBullock\u2019s new film, the female-driven Ocean\u2019s 8, is in theaters now."}

Some fans may be familiar with the show courtesy of Chris Jericho\u2019s stint on it a few years back.\n\nThe heart of the matter\n\nOn the aforementioned episode of Total Divas, Nikki had the following to say to her agent when it came to actually accepting the opportunity.\n\n'I'm ... I'm gonna pass. I know it's an amazing opportunity, but I just ... I really want my comeback to be in that ring and nowhere else.''\n\nGiven when the show was filmed we have yet to see her actual return to the ring which, as we all know, has now taken place.\n\nAlso read: 5 Reasons why Nikki Bella is the greatest female WWE Superstar of all time\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nIt\u2019ll be interesting to see whether or not they show Nikki getting back inside the squared circle before the end of the season, but in terms of her current trajectory, there\u2019s a chance that The Fearless One could end up on DWTS after all. It seems as if she\u2019s taking even longer off from the ring this time round, so a run on the show wouldn\u2019t be entirely out of the question.\n\nAuthor\u2019s take\n\nIt seems as if Nikki going on DWTS would\u2019ve suited her down to a tee, but we\u2019re glad that she decided to return to the ring instead. She got a series of good pops during her latest run, and no matter what anyone else says, the proposal at WrestleMania was a heart-warming moment for fans of Total Divas and Nikki herself.\n\nSend us news tips at fightclub@sportskeeda.com\n\nAdvertisement"}
{"label": true, "txt": "Cobra Kai is an American comedy-drama web television series based on The Karate Kid film series created by Robert Mark Kamen that premiered on May 2, 2018 on YouTube Red (now YouTube Premium). The series was created by Jon Hurwitz, Hayden Schlossberg, and Josh Heald and stars Ralph Macchio and William Zabka, reprising their roles from the films, who also serve as co-executive producers. It takes place 34 years after the original film and follows the reopening of the Cobra Kai karate dojo by Johnny Lawrence and the rekindling of his old rivalry with Daniel LaRusso. On May 10, 2018, it was announced that the series had been renewed for a second season of ten episodes that is set to premiere in 2019.\n\nPremise [ edit ]\n\nCobra Kai takes place 34 years after the original film and follows a down-and-out Johnny Lawrence, who seeks redemption by reopening the infamous Cobra Kai karate dojo, reigniting his rivalry with a now successful Daniel LaRusso, who has been struggling to maintain balance in his life without the guidance of his mentor, Mr. Miyagi. The show is about two men addressing past demons and present frustrations the only way they know how: through karate.\"[1]\n\nRunning parallel to the conflict are the story arcs of Johnny's and Daniel's students. Johnny opens a new Cobra Kai dojo that attracts a group of bullied nerds and social outcasts who find a camaraderie and self-confidence under his tutelage, but who take his aggressive philosophy too far, in particular his star pupil, Miguel Diaz. In contrast, Johnny's estranged son, Robby Keene, comes under the wing of Daniel, who hires the boy at his car dealership, initially not knowing that Johnny is his father. Daniel eventually proves a positive influence to the boy, teaching him Mr. Miyagi's philosophy of balance. Meanwhile, Daniel's daughter, Samantha, is caught in the middle of these conflicts as she learns who her true friends are and a better path to follow.\n\nCast and characters [ edit ]\n\nMain [ edit ]\n\nRecurring [ edit ]\n\nJoe Seo as Kyler\n\nJacob Bertrand as Eli \"Hawk\" Moskowitz\n\nNichole Brown as Aisha Robinson\n\nConnor Murdock as Kev\n\nGriffin Santopietro as Anthony LaRusso\n\nHannah Kepple as Moon\n\nGabe Bowles as Tim\n\nOwen Morgan as Bert\n\nAnnalisa Cochrane as Yasmine\n\nGianni Decenzo as Demetri\n\nCameron Markeles as Frank\n\nDenzel K Williams as Caleb\n\nBo Mitchell as Brucks\n\nBret Ernst as Louie LaRusso Jr.\n\nDan Ahdoot as Anoush\n\nJonathan Mercedes as A.J.\n\nSusan Gallagher as Lynn\n\nKwajalyn Brown as Sheila\n\nTerayle Hill as Trey\n\nEd Asner as Sid Weinberg\n\nVanessa Rubio as Carmen Diaz\n\nRose Bianco as Rosa Diaz\n\nDiora Baird as Shannon Keene\n\nErin Bradley Dangar as Counselor Blatt\n\nGuest [ edit ]\n\nDavid Shatraw as Tom Cole (\"Cobra Kai Never Dies\")\n\nKen Davitian as Armand Zarkarian (\"Counterbalance\")\n\nRandee Heller as Lucille LaRusso (\"Molting\")\n\nMartin Kove as John Kreese (\"Mercy\")\n\nPat Morita and Elisabeth Shue appear via archive footage from the first film as Mr. Miyagi and Ali Mills, respectively.\n\nEpisodes [ edit ]\n\nNo. Title Directed by Written by Original release date 1 \"Ace Degenerate\" Jon Hurwitz & Hayden Schlossberg Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, & Hayden Schlossberg May 2, 2018 ( ) Thirty-four years after losing to Daniel LaRusso in the 1984 All Valley Under-18 Karate Championship, Johnny Lawrence struggles to make a living as a handyman while Daniel runs a successful car dealership chain in the San Fernando Valley. One night, Johnny saves his teenage neighbor Miguel Diaz from a group of bullies at a nearby strip mall before he is arrested for assaulting them. After being released from police custody, Johnny gets a visit from his wealthy, bullying stepfather Sid Weinberg. Sid gives Johnny a check and officially disowns him. A drunk Johnny drives to the All Valley Sports Arena and relives his last encounter with his former sensei John Kreese when his car is wrecked in a hit-and-run incident. Despite his protests, his car is towed to one of Daniel's dealerships for repairs. The next day, he goes to the dealership in an attempt to take the car back, only to run into Daniel. The meeting not only reignites Johnny's smouldering enmity for Daniel but he also finds out that Daniel's daughter Samantha was one of the passengers in the hit-and-run incident. He returns home and tells Miguel that he will be his sensei and opens his own Cobra Kai dojo with the money he received from Sid. 2 \"Strike First\" Jon Hurwitz & Hayden Schlossberg Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, & Hayden Schlossberg May 2, 2018 ( ) Miguel begins his karate training with Johnny bullying him for his asthma and low self-esteem. Johnny is informed by the health department that the dojo needs a lot of work before he can officially teach students. Meanwhile, Daniel and his wife Amanda get into an argument after Daniel scolds Samantha for inviting her friends over to their home for a pool party without their permission. Reconciling with his daughter, Daniel finds out that Samantha is romantically interested in a boy called Kyler and offers to invite him to a family dinner. At school, Miguel befriends two social outcasts named Dimitri and Eli. During lunch, they talk about the rich girls Samantha hangs out with and discover that Kyler is one of the bullies who attacked Miguel a few nights ago. Johnny is informed that his son, Robby Keene, has been caught with drugs at school. During dinner, Daniel notices Kyler's bruises and learns that he received his injuries from Johnny. Kyler however, lies about why Johnny attacked him and Daniel goes to the dojo to confront Johnny over the incident. 3 \"Esqueleto\" Jennifer Celotta Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, & Hayden Schlossberg May 2, 2018 ( ) Johnny tries to recruit more students to the dojo and Daniel decides to chaperone Samantha to the school Halloween dance. Miguel's karate training is stepped up as Johnny urges him to use the Cobra Kai creed of \"Strike first. Strike hard. No mercy\" in his everyday life and gives him a skeleton costume for the Halloween dance. Daniel embarrasses his daughter Samantha during the dance and Miguel overhears Kyler and his friends talking about Samantha as a sex object. Miguel attacks Kyler, but he is overpowered and severely beaten by the bullies. Johnny, who has been at the school handing out flyers for Cobra Kai finds Miguel in the bathroom and takes him home to his mother Carmen, who warns him to stay away from her son. 4 \"Cobra Kai Never Dies\" Jennifer Celotta Story by : Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, & Hayden Schlossberg\n\nTeleplay by : Jason Belleville May 2, 2018 ( ) Robby learns of the new dojo and is embarrassed by his father's recruitment methods.

Johnny tries to confront Robby after he learns that his son has been skipping school. When Johnny tells him not to throw his life away, Robby rejects him and points out that Johnny left him as a child and that Johnny's own life is wasted. After seeing a father eating with his young son, Johnny pleads for Carmen to let him continue Miguel's training, vowing not to fail him again. When Miguel comes back, Johnny tells him to work on his defense and counter attacks. 5 \"Counterbalance\" Josh Heald Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, & Hayden Schlossberg May 2, 2018 ( ) Miguel shows improvement in both his karate skills and his general health. Daniel tries to make a shady deal that could shut down Cobra Kai, but hurts innocent business owners in the process.

When Kyler embarrasses her at school, Miguel stands up for her and attacks him and his friends, defeating them all in an impressive display and gaining Samantha's respect. Robby decides to try and reconcile with his father, but when he sees Johnny acting in a fatherly way with Miguel, he feels he has been replaced. Amanda notices the changes in Daniel's behavior since the reopening of Cobra Kai, leading Daniel to visit the grave of Mr. Miyagi to reflect and ask for wisdom. As Daniel begins to drive away, he recalls a discussion he had with Miyagi about maintaining balance in life, not just karate.

Thanks to Miguel, Johnny is forced to remember what it was like for him as an outcast with an uncaring stepfather before discovering Cobra Kai. The next day, Johnny admits that he has been tough and cruel to his remaining students, but refuses to apologize, telling them that life is not fair and they must overcome the challenges that life will throw at them. Eli returns to the dojo with a distinctive mohawk haircut, which makes Johnny nickname him \"Hawk\". Meanwhile, Robby gets a job at LaRusso Auto with the sole intention of making his father mad and Miguel and Samantha slowly become friends at school. Robby finally decides he wants to learn karate under Daniel's tutelage after seeing him practice his karate forms. 7 \"All Valley\" Steve Pink Story by : Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, Hayden Schlossberg, & Stacey Harman\n\nTeleplay by : Stacey Harman May 2, 2018 ( ) Johnny uses painful methods to train his new students. Miguel asks Johnny for advice on girls and Johnny manages to give him a boost of confidence which leads to Miguel asking Samantha out on a successful date.

When Johnny goes to the meeting of the athletic committee to try to persuade them to reverse the ban, he is opposed by Daniel, who is a committee member. Johnny tells the committee that his teachings are different from those of Kreese and Silver, revealing that Kreese himself is dead. He says that he has learned from his past mistakes and that his dojo is now a place where people who get bullied are taught self confidence and how to stand up for themselves. The committee is convinced by what seems to be Johnny's genuine sincerity and allows Cobra Kai to compete, which infuriates Daniel. Meanwhile, despite initially agreeing to help his friends sneak inside the dealership at night, Robby stops them from doing so using his karate skills and a security camera. 8 \"Molting\" Steve Pink Story by : Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, Hayden Schlossberg, Stacey Harman, & Michael Jonathan Smith\n\nTeleplay by : Michael Jonathan Smith May 2, 2018 ( ) Despite Daniel's strong objections, the All Valley Sports Karate Board decides that Cobra Kai is allowed to compete in the karate tournament, so Johnny steps up his game with additional training and unconventional methods. Daniel's family learns about Cobra Kai being in the tournament, and only Samantha thinks that Cobra Kai has changed because of Miguel. Daniel's cousin Louie decides to take action. Johnny warns Miguel about Samantha and the LaRusso family, telling him about how Daniel involved himself in his past relationship with Ali Mills in 1984. While skateboarding to Daniel's house, Robby meets Samantha. Johnny is invited by Carmen for dinner, where he learns more about Miguel's family. Daniel bonds closer with Robby, but Robby refuses to divulge the info about his father. Miguel works up the confidence to go to Daniel's house even though Daniel hates Cobra Kai to introduce himself as Samantha's boyfriend in order to ease the conflict between Johnny and Daniel. When Miguel goes to Daniel's house, he sees Samantha and Robby bonding, leaving him heartbroken. Louie and his thugs destroy Johnny's car before Johnny defeats them and heads off to confront Daniel. 9 \"Different but Same\" Jon Hurwitz & Hayden Schlossberg Story by : Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, & Hayden Schlossberg\n\nTeleplay by : Jason Belleville May 2, 2018 ( ) Johnny arrives at the LaRusso residence to confront Daniel over Louie destroying his car, but Amanda quickly defuses the situation by inviting Johnny over for breakfast.

Meanwhile, Aisha gets several kids in school to attend a party at the park ahead of Yasmine's planned birthday party. Robby breaks Samantha out and they head to the party, but a drunk Miguel confronts Robby and accidentally hits Samantha during the scuffle, causing her to think all her father's words about Cobra Kai are true. Johnny drives Daniel back to his home when they see Robby, which infuriates Johnny upon learning that his son has been learning karate from Daniel.

While we haven't seen Meghan publicly in this outfit before, the suit does resemble the one Harry wore in their official engagement photos.\n\nThat said, it's unclear it was taken as another potential portrait by photographer Alexi Lubomirski back in November or if it's a more recent snapshot.\n\n\n\nWhile we were zoomed in, we took a look at what else the Queen keeps on her living room table. In case you, too, were wondering, the image behind the happy couple appears to be of William and Harry and one on the other table, in the light brown wood frame is a portrait of the Queen's close friend and third cousin Queen Margrethe of Denmark. The British monarch also keeps her handbag close by, as well a pair of glasses, multiple clocks, and various other dishes and small trinkets.\n\nGetty Images\n\nWhile we don't have any details on this mystery photograph, Lubomirski recently opened up about taking the official wedding portrait of the newly named Duke and Duchess of Sussex. \"It was just one of those magical moments, when you're a photographer and everything falls into place,\" he said in an interview with Reuters.\n\n\"The sun is setting right just over the top of Windsor Castle just behind them, it was just the most serene, beautiful light, they're in love, walking around this beautiful garden,\" he continued. \"I said just before you go in, let's sit down on these stairs, and she just slumped in between his legs.\"\n\n\n\nGetty Images\n\nAs for what they were smiling about? \"They were just laughing because they were joking about how they were exhausted and finally it was over.\""}

I think people watch good drama shows and they completely suspend their disbelief, they feel like they\u2019re looking through the keyhole at another world, if you do it well enough. If you have stunt celebrity cameo casting, it completely pulls them out of it. They feel like they\u2019re watching a Saturday Night Live sketch.

With him being a no-show, fellow pro dancer Alan Bersten had to fill in as Vanessa's partner.\n\nThe 37-year-old would, later on, take to Twitter to apologize to his dance partner saying: \"As you are all aware, I had to leave the show last week to take care of some personal issues. I take full responsibility for my actions and want to apologize to my partner Vanessa. We are both looking forward to dancing for our fans next week!\"\n\nIt was reported that the cause of their so-called feud was their clashing personalities. Apparently, the \"DWTS\" pair did not have chemistry outside the dance floor. However, the two were since captured together giving each other a warm hug after their dance rehearsals which may have been a sign that they're finally able to work out their issues.\n\nMaks' return was an emotional one not because of their issues but because of the theme of the episode. With the theme \"My Most Memorable Year,\" Vanessa had chosen 2017 as her most memorable year mainly because of the birth of her third child, Phoenix Robert, who was just 29 weeks when he came out.\n\nVanessa recalled how at the time she was taken into emergency surgery and all she could think of was the safety of her unborn child. Nick Lachey, Vanessa's husband who is also competing on the show with Maks' wife Peta Murgatroyd, remembered feeling helpless at the time. \"I think as a man, you want to believe you can protect your kids. Protect your wife. I never felt so helpless. There was nothing I could do,\" he says.\n\nMaks and Vanessa danced the Rumba to one of Nick's songs, citing it as the song that helped their family develop a closer bond.\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gs0D8aazPc4\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\">"}

Here's what we know about their wedding plans so far.\n\nThe Engagement Ring\n\nWhen Zylka popped the question, he did so with a stunning 20-carat pear shaped diamond ring by celebrity jewelry Greene & Co.\n\n\"The ring was so gorgeous and sparkling,\" Hilton told People. \"I was shaking as I put it on. It is the most beautiful ring that I have ever seen!\"\n\nWorth $2 million, the piece was inspired by a ring belonging to Hilton's mother Kathy.\n\n\"So happy & excited to be engaged to the love of my life,\" Hilton wrote on Instagram at the time. \"My best friend & soulmate. Perfect for me in every way. So dedicated, loyal, loving & kindhearted. I feel like the luckiest girl in the world! You are my dream come true! Thank you for showing me that fairytales do exist.\"\n\nMore details on the ring, right this way.\n\n\n\nThe Wedding Planner\n\nHilton's mother is helping to organize the nuptials. \"'I love planning weddings\u2014I'm the wedding planner,\" she told Life & Style. The magazine also claims that Hilton wants \"an over-the-top, fairy-tale wedding.\"\n\nThe Dress\n\nAccording to Cosmopolitan.com, Hilton plans to visit \"a few showrooms\" in New York City to search for her wedding gown. \"I\u2019m really inspired by Princess Grace Kelly and Elizabeth Taylor,\" she says. \"I thought they looked so classic and elegant and beautiful. I definitely want it to be a very timeless and elegant look.\"\n\nShe and her sister clearly have similar taste.

She can do no wrong,\" she said.\n\n\n\nNicky Hilton on her wedding day in 2015.

Not sure when it will be, but it\u2019s so fun looking at dresses and venues for now.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Guest List\n\nPlans are still coming together for Hilton's nuptials, but we do know one person on the guest list, her longtime friend, Kim Kardashian. \"Yes, of course I will invite [Kim],\" Hilton says. \"I love her. We\u2019ve been friends since we were little girls.\"\n\nHilton and Kardashian have had a complicated friendship over the past decade, but given Hilton's recent participation in the Yeezy 6 campaign, posing as a Kim clone, it's safe to say the two are on good terms once again.\n\nThe Location\n\nHilton hasn't set a date yet (in January she told Extra it would be \"soon\"), but she does know she wants the ceremony to be \"close to home,\" reports Cosmopolitan. \"I really want my grandfather to be there and my family. I don\u2019t want to have it somewhere where people need to travel too far,\" she says.\n\nPreviously Hilton had also mentioned that she might like to have multiple weddings. \"For my 21st birthday I had five parties, so maybe for the wedding I\u2019ll have a European one, an American one, one for everyone around the world,\" she said."}
{"label": true, "txt": "\u201cVegas is a funny town,\u201d said Jimmy Kimmel during his emotional opening monologue for Jimmy Kimmel Live on Monday night. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to forget people live there.\u201d\n\nThe late-night host would know: Kimmel is a Vegas native himself, having moved there from Brooklyn when he was 9. So when he launched into his introduction to Monday night\u2019s show, just one day after a shooter, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock of Mesquite, Nevada, opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers outside Las Vegas\u2019s Mandalay Bay Hotel, the news was particularly poignant. James Corden, Trevor Noah , Stephen Colbert , and Seth Meyers all, like Kimmel, devoted their opening monologues to discussing the shooting in Las Vegas.\n\nBut Kimmel, who has recently found a calling transforming his show into a political conscience (even though, as he said Monday night, \u201cI want this to be a comedy show. I hate talking about stuff like this\u201d), began tearing up as soon as the cameras started rolling, giving a particularly unfiltered perspective on gun control and the government\u2019s continuing inaction in the face of mass shootings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the kind of thing that makes you want to throw up or give up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s too much to process.\u201d He offered a scathing indictment of both the president, who offered his \u201cwarmest condolences\u201d on Twitter while having signed a bill in February that allowed mentally ill individuals easier access to purchasing guns, as well as of the 56 senators who voted against closing a loophole that allows prospective gun buyers to evade the government-mandated background checks, showing their faces on screen and describing them as those \u201cwho won\u2019t do anything about this because the NRA has their balls in a money clip.\u201d For in the wake of various incidents of gun violence\u2014Sandy Hook, Charleston, Orlando, now Las Vegas\u2014the National Rifle Association has successfully lobbied in favor of second-amendment rights: \u201cOur forefathers wanted us to have AK-47s, is the argument,\u201d Kimmel said, incredulous.\n\nPoliticians\u2019 inaction\u2014and their widespread reluctance to turn mass shootings into mobilizing efforts in favor of stricter gun control\u2014was the subject of the monologues of Kimmel\u2019s peers, too. As Corden, whose voice also tightened as he delivered a quiet, measured speech, said, \u201cSome say it\u2019s too early to talk about gun control; for those victims last night, it\u2019s far too late.\u201d He, like Noah, is a recent New York transplant who has witnessed the two worst mass shootings since the mid-20th century in the past two years: First, at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida last summer; and now, in Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\n\u201cIt should be hard for everyone to fathom,\u201d Corden said. \u201cGun violence should not be a staple of American life.\u201d\n\nAnd yet the response to these shootings\u2014of which there have been 275 so far in 2017\u2014has become rote. \u201cPeople are becoming more accustomed to this kind of news. I almost know how it\u2019s going to play out,\u201d Noah said during The Daily Show on Monday night, a sentiment Meyers echoed opening Late Night With Seth Meyers . \u201cWe\u2019re shocked, we\u2019re sad, thoughts and prayers, and then, almost on cue, people are going to come out and say, whatever you do, when you speak about the shooting, don\u2019t talk about guns,\u201d Meyers said.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that politicians have refused to pass gun control legislation that, as Stephen Colbert pointed out, \u201cthe vast majority of Americans want.\u201d Later this week, a bill that would make it easier for individuals to purchase gun silencers\u2014which, as Politico reported, currently have more stringent requirements for purchase than guns themselves \u2014was expected to go up for a vote in the House of Representatives. However, Sunday night\u2019s shooting is expected to delay the bill to some degree\u2014for, at least, if elected leaders refuse to \u201cpoliticize\u201d an incident of gun violence as a way of promoting gun control, the converse is also true, that they will also be reluctant to promote gun (and gun accessory) access. As Noah said, \u201cDon\u2019t talk about guns.\u201d\n\nColbert closed out The Late Show \u2019s introductory monologue with a firm address directly to Trump: \u201cDoing nothing is cowardice.\u201d he said. \u201cYou want to make America great again? Do something the past two presidents haven\u2019t been able to do: Pass any kind of common-sense gun control legislation.\u201d\n\nFormer 'Daily Show' correspondents Samantha Bee and Jason Jones on falling in love:"}

{"label": true, "txt": "This Is Us is toying with an alternate timeline in the Season 2 finale\u2014and it\u2019s not via a flashback or a flash forward. While the episode, titled \u201cThe Wedding,\u201d will feature some upbeat moments as Kate Pearson (Chrissy Metz) gets ready to marry her longtime love Toby (Chris Sullivan), emotions will run high as she walks down the aisle without her dearly departed dad (Milo Ventimiglia) by her side.\n\nBut now, promos for \u201cThe Wedding\u201d episode confirm that Jack will be back for his little girl\u2019s big day. The teaser for the This Is Us season 2 finale shows Jack Pearson in the present day, sporting gray hair, a salt-and-pepper goatee, and wire-rimmed glasses as he touches his wife Rebecca\u2019s (Mandy Moore) face and says, \u201cWhere\u2019d the time go, Bec?\u201d\n\nThis Is Us fans (and pretty much the rest of the universe) know that Jack Pearson died on Super Bowl Sunday in 1998 when he was 53 years old. The Pearson patriarch saved the family dog (and a pillowcase full of family belongings!) after a house fire, but he couldn\u2019t save himself. Complications from smoke inhalation did Papa Pearson in, and now Kate\u2019s wedding marks 20 years since his tragic passing.\n\nThe trailer for \u201cThe Wedding\u201d features a flashback of a younger Jack telling 10-year-old Kate (Mackenzie Hancsicsak): \u201cThe guy that gets to marry you, Katey girl, he is one lucky guy.\u201d Later, we see adult Kate flanked by her brothers Kevin and Randall (Justin Hartley, Sterling K. Brown) as she walks down the aisle. The promo teases a \u201cspecial guest\u201d at Kate and Toby\u2019s wedding and that\u2019s when old man Jack is seen.\n\nWhile Milo Ventimiglia\u2019s appearance as a 70-something Jack Pearson is likely a dream, This Is Us fans may recall last season when Randall had a hallucination and saw Jack standing on a ladder at the family cabin. The cabin is also the setting for Kate\u2019s wedding.\n\nThis won\u2019t be the first time This Is Us has introduced an older version of a character that fell outside of the timelines the NBC drama usually focuses on. During the post-Super Bowl episode, 37-year-old Randall was shown in the future as a man in this 50s. At the time, This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman teased the alternate timeline to Deadline, saying, \u201cWe show a new timeline, in the future, which is extremely exciting for a show that plays in time and has till-now played in the past/present. But there is other stuff coming, too\u2026there is a plan for the show, there always has been, we aren\u2019t just shooting from the hip.\u201d Fogelman has said the future may play a big part in This Is Us seasons to come.\n\nnull\n\nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly, This Is Us star Susan Kelechi Watson, who plays Randall\u2019s wife Beth Pearson on the show, said \u201cThe Wedding\u201d episode will be a special one.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Kelechi Watson said. \u201cIt felt like the natural way for this season to end.

{"label": true, "txt": "Kesha continues to show why she is one singer fans can truly connect with. Accompanying the release of her new song, \"Learn To Let Go,\" the 30-year-old wrote a stand-out piece explaining the meaning behind the song for The Huffington Post. In the essay, Kesha says she is learning to let go after everything she has endured in her past. The musician has been extremely open about her struggles, including battling an eating disorder, suffering from depression, and her ongoing lawsuit with music producer Dr. Luke.\n\nAccording to Kesha, \"Learn To Let Go\" has \"become one of [her] mantras over the last few years.\" Her past is something that she refuses to let define who she is now or prevent her from moving forward, especially when it comes to her career. \"You have to learn to let go of those bad feelings and move forward,\" she writes. \"We all have bias based on whatever our own story and life experience has been, but really the only way to truly evolve is to let the past be the past and move forward with an open heart.\"\n\nIt's easy to let people who have wronged you or let the difficulties you have faced \"haunt you forever,\" as Kesha puts it, but why give them that power? \"Learn from your mistakes but don\u2019t dwell on them, and if you feel like someone has wronged you, let that be their problem \u2015 not yours,\" the \"Praying\" singer notes.\n\nIt may be easier said than done to move on from a situation that has influenced your life negatively, but her advice is something that almost anyone could try apply to their own life. It could inspire people to take their lives by the reins and steer them in the direction they've been hoping to.\n\nThat's exactly what I plan to do. I identify with everything Kesha wrote. We have had two very different life experiences, but that doesn't mean I can't find comfort in what she's saying.\n\nWhen I first lost my 16-year-old brother in a car accident 18 years ago, it was traumatic, to say the least. To make matters worse, there were some family and friends who chose to treat me and my family in unsympathetic ways that were even cruel at times. In most ways, we've managed to move forward with our lives and put much of the toxicity behind us. However, I would be lying if I said it doesn't affect us in a small way today. Letting go of the past completely is tough, but after hearing Kesha express herself in such a light and free way makes me want to cut even that extremely small portion of negativity out of my life for good.\n\nShe truly has a way with words \u2014 even when she's not singing.\n\nkeshaVEVO on YouTube\n\nIn another part of Kesha's essay, she shares that looking back on her childhood has greatly impacted her life. It's something she also incorporated into her \"Learn To Let Go\" video by including home videos of herself as a little girl. \"It\u2019s this idea of reconnecting to my child-like self because that\u2019s when you are so full of wonder and joy,\" the Rainbow artist explains. \"You can choose to learn from the bullsh*t along the way but not dwell on it and instead connect with that joyful childhood innocence.\"\n\nWho would've ever thought that looking to your childhood might be able to help you out of a rut? It really does make sense, and is an interesting technique that could push you to a more carefree space.\n\nOf course, pain isn't something that goes away overnight. Sometimes you have to work at being happy, which is absolutely OK. And when you have someone like Kesha who opens up about her dark days, but then also shows you how to learn from and let go of the darkness at the same time, well, it's a beautiful thing."}

Eventually frustrated in New York and the lack of progression,[9] Scott moved to Los Angeles, California, after only four months in the state.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Webster was abandoned by his friend who had promised to help him by providing housing. His parents cut him off financially and he eventually was forced to relocate back to Houston, where his parents kicked him out of their home. Webster moved back to Los Angeles once again and began to sleep on the couch of a friend who studied at University of Southern California.[11] Atlanta-based rapper and owner of Grand Hustle Records, T.I. would later hear one of Webster's productions, titled \"Lights (Love Sick)\".

{"label": true, "txt": "Pretty much every TV show offers up some love for the holidays with fun Christmas or Halloween episodes each year, but Thanksgiving always seems to be looked over. At least, in every show but Friends. The iconic NBC sitcom made a point of giving us some of the most memorable Turkey Day moments ever, and it's still the best show to binge-watch with friends or family while you're full of turkey and mashed potatoes. To get ready for all your Turkey Day Instagram captions, let's revisit the best Friends Thanksgiving quotes. These memorable quotes from Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, Ross, Rachel, and Joey are sure to be a hit among all the Friends fans in your life this Thanksgiving... and if you've surrounded yourself with people with good taste, then chances are they're all Friends fans.\n\n1. \"I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting.\"\n\nHolidays with the family aren't always a piece of pumpkin pie, and this Chandler quote from the very first Thanksgiving episode of Friends is perfect for reminding everyone to enjoy a holiday get-together that doesn't wind up going terribly wrong.\n\n2. \"I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked.\"\n\n\"And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas.\"\n\n\"And a crappy New Year.\"\n\nBut if you're Thanksgiving does end up being terrible, making jokes about it always helps! That's how the six Friends dealt with their disastrous Thanksgivings.\n\n3. \"Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.\"\n\nThanksgiving can also be a good time to clear the air with your family. Let's just hope you're family talks aren't as awkward as Joey's.\n\n4. \"Oh, sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!\"\n\nIf your Turkey Day feast isn't up to snuff, then you can always fall back on what Phoebe exclaimed when she took a bite of Monica's \"mockolate\" chip cookies.\n\n5. \"Okay guys, I have exactly 28 minutes before I have to baste again.\"\n\nOr maybe you're the one in charge of cooking up the Thanksgiving meal this year. If so, why not pull a Monica and let everyone know you're not slacking on your crucial basting duties.\n\n6. \"The game is over? We eat now?\"\n\nThis line may have come from a one-episode character who was really only in the show to make Joey and Chandler fight over her and say some jokes about the Netherlands, but I relate to it more than any other Thanksgiving quote on this list.\n\n7. \"It wouldn't be Thanksgiving without a little emotional scarring.\"\n\nCan you pass the cranberry sauce and the passive-aggressive comments from my grandparents, please?\n\n8. \"Oh. And I'm also thankful for thongs.\"\n\nNeed something to add when you're family goes around to say what they're thankful for? Joey's got you covered.\n\n9. \"Well, Judy, you did it. She's finally full.\"\n\nPerfect for when you're feeling that post-dinner coma coming on and you can't imagine eating another bite, like when flashback-Monica turned down a pie.\n\n10. \"What is with everyone today? It's Thanksgiving, not truth day!\"\n\nFor when the Thanksgiving discussions start getting a bit too real.\n\n11. \"Turkeys are beautiful, intelligent animals.\"\n\n\"No, they're not. They're ugly and stupid and delicious.\"\n\nIf anyone tries to make you feel guilty for enjoying your fair share of turkey this year, just remember Joey's response.\n\n12. \"Look at her holding those yams. Those are our two worst enemies, Ross: Rachel Green and complex carbohydrates.\"\n\nOne of the most memorable Thanksgiving episodes ever was when Brad Pitt guest starred and put the smackdown on yams.\n\n13. \"You can't have Thanksgiving without turkey. That's like Fourth of July without apple pie or Friday with no two pizzas.\"\n\nJoey's immortal words about Thanksgiving will live on forever.\n\n14. \"Everyone, we're using our fancy china, and it's very expensive, so please be careful. Just to be clear, comedy with the plates will not be well-received.\"\n\nIt's always nice to lay down some ground rules about what jokes won't be tolerated at the dinner table.\n\n15. \"Don't you put words in people's mouths. You put turkey in people's mouths.\"\n\nAnd finally, of course, it's Joey that gave us the perfect Thanksgiving clapback for when people try to stir up drama instead of focusing on what's really important: eating turkey."}

What about me?,'\u201d Crawford shared. \u201cI said, \u2018Your time will come, honey, don\u2019t worry.\u2019 I think it would be fun for her to get to really re-create my original spot.\u201d (The supermodel-in-training has already shared a Versace catwalk with her mom, so we think there\u2019s a good chance that\u2019ll happen.)\n\nCourtesy Pepsi\n\nSpeaking about her debut Pepsi commercial, Crawford reveals that she still has those iconic denim cut-offs.\n\n\u201cThey were my jeans that I wore that day and when we were doing wardrobe the stylist asked to just cut my jeans off,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause your own jeans always fit you better if you\u2019ve worn them awhile, so we just cut off my jeans and I got to keep my own jeans.\u201d\n\nCrawford wore the same cutoffs for the spot 10 years later, which had a cameo from her very young children.\n\n\u201cMy kids were little so this actually Presley\u2019s second Pepsi commercial,\u201d she says. \u201cThe car in that one is not a Lamborghini, it\u2019s an SUV, and I\u2019ve got my two little kids in the back so they have been part of the Pepsi family really since they were little.\u201d\n\nBut this time her look was totally different: a denim shirt, white jeans and boots.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if the shorts would still fit but this time we didn\u2019t want to bring them back because the commercial is about passing onto the next generation, it was a nod to the old commercial without wearing the exact same outfit,\u201d Crawford says. \u201cTime has gone on and I have an 18-year-old son now. I think Kaia will wear them one day.\u201d\n\nSo what is Super Bowl Sunday like at the Gerber household?\n\n\u201cIt involves chili and some wings and Pepsi of course, and probably at a certain point, margaritas,\u201d Crawford shares. \u201cIt\u2019s about the tradition of getting together. Some years I watch less of the football, but I always look forward to the commercials and the halftime show. I think we are all in our busy current lifestyles, and we appreciate those things that bring people together. If you think about it that\u2019s why award shows are fun too because you have a group of people sitting around together doing a shared experience \u2014 it\u2019s social. And for me I love the social moment of the Super Bowl.\u201d\n\nSee the full reveal of Crawford\u2019s new Pepsi spot during Super Bowl LII on February 4 on NBC."}

Even the Duchess of Cambridge had a hard time seeing her son off to nursery school. Kate Middleton admitted that she\u2019s still getting used to dropping Prince George off at school and mom, we feel you.\n\nDue to her suffering with hyperemesis gravidarum, severe morning sickness caused by her current pregnancy, Middleton was unable to attend Prince George\u2019s first day of school drop-off with her husband, Prince William. But thankfully, Middleton is overcoming her sickness and is now able to partake in the daily routine.\n\nDuring her speech at the Place2Be School Leaders Forum, Middleton stated, \"As a mother just getting used to leaving my own child at the school gates, it is clear to me that it takes a whole community to help raise a child.\"\n\nAccording to E! News, the Duchess attended the forum in order to talk about how schools can get more involved with mental health initiatives \u2014 which is something Middleton, Prince William, and Prince Harry are all advocates for via their Heads Together campaign.\n\n\"Whether we are school leaders, teachers, support staff or parents \u2014 we are all in this together,\" Middleton continued. \"We are all working to give children the emotional strength they need to face their future lives and thrive.\"\n\nWatch The Duchess of Cambridge speak at the @Place2Be School Leaders Forum. pic.twitter.com/HRQlrJVHD1 \u2014 Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) November 8, 2017\n\nPrince George started full-time nursery school at Thomas\u2019s Battersea in September.

Once a Jammer, always a Jammer.\u201d\n\nSt. Clair and Parham on Monday released a video message to the show's fans addressing the show's end. \"We had three beautiful seasons and we wanted to thank you guys,\" Parham said.\n\nAdded St. Clair: \"We're so thankful for all of you guys. You made it possible for us to tell the story we were always meant to tell.\"\n\nThe single-camera comedy premiered on USA Network in 2014 and hailed from creators, writers and stars St. Clair and Parham. While never a ratings smash for the cabler, the half-hour amassed a devoted following, i.e. \"Jammers.\" In addition to fellow castmembers Keegan-Michael Key and Zach Woods, Playing House also drew an impressive guest list over its three-year run that include Laurie Metcalf and Michaela Watkins, as well as recurring players like Jane Kaczmarek and Lindsay Sloane.\n\nPlaying House earned a season two renewal that included an early VOD window that let die-hard viewers watch new episodes up to a week early and allowed the network to better capitalize on the show's fervent fanbase. For season three, USA Network released all eight episodes on VOD the day after the show's season premiere on June 23.\n\nHowever, there was nearly two-year delay between seasons two and three as St. Clair battled breast cancer. She is now in remission and chose to also write her diagnosis into the third season when her character, Emma, also discovered she had breast cancer. St. Clair opened up about her decision to write her cancer battle into the series for a THR guest column. The storyline earned the show some of its strongest reviews yet.\n\nIn addition to creating, writing and starring on the series, St. Clair and Parham both stepped behind the camera to direct in season three.\n\nWhen speaking with THR in June, St. Clair and Parham revealed some possible ideas for season four, including having Maggie (Parham)'s ex-husband remarry and a possible trip to London. (Parham's season-three love interest was played by British actor Ben Willbond.)\n\nIn their video Monday, Parham and St. Clair confirmed \"we've already got some idea cooking up\" for future projects.\n\nSt. Clair and Parham executive produced the series with Ravi Nandan of A24 Films. Universal Cable Productions produced.\n\nFor USA, the decision to end Playing House also comes as the cabler has shifted away from comedy series in recent years as it pushes to go darker and edgier with originals like Mr. Robot, Queen of the South and Colony. Playing House was USA's lone scripted comedy and one of just two half-hour series, the other being reality series Chrisley Knows Best.\n\nWatch the pair's full joint video below:"}

{"label": true, "txt": "Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was born Jacqueline Lee Bouvier on July 28, 1929, in Southampton, New York. She married John F. Kennedy in 1953. When she became first lady in 1961, she worked to restore the White House to its original elegance and to protect its holdings. After JFK's assassination in 1963, she moved to New York City. She married Aristotle Onassis in 1968. She died of cancer in 1994.\n\nEarly Life\n\nJacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis was born on July 28, 1929, in Southampton, New York. Her father, John Bouvier, was a wealthy New York stockbroker of French Catholic descent, and her mother, Janet, was an accomplished equestrienne of Irish Catholic heritage. Onassis was a bright, curious and occasionally mischievous child. One of her elementary school teachers described her as \"a darling child, the prettiest little girl, very clever, very artistic, and full of the devil.\" Another teacher, less charmed by young Jacqueline, wrote admonishingly that \"her disturbing conduct in geography class made it necessary to exclude her from the room.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website\n\nOnassis enjoyed a privileged childhood of ballet lessons at the Metropolitan Opera House and French lessons beginning at age of 12. Like her mother, Onassis loved riding and was highly skilled on horseback. In 1940, at the age of 11, she won a national junior horsemanship competition. The New York Times reported, \"Jacqueline Bouvier, an eleven-year-old equestrienne from East Hampton, Long Island, scored a double victory in the horsemanship competition. Miss Bouvier achieved a rare distinction. The occasions are few when the same rider wins both competitions in the same show.\"\n\nOnassis attended Miss Porter's School, a prestigious boarding school in Farmington, Connecticut; in addition to its rigorous academics, the school also emphasized proper manners and the art of conversation. There she excelled as a student, writing frequent essays and poems for the school newspaper and winning the award as the school's top literature student in her senior year. Also during her senior year, in 1947, Onassis was named \"Debutante of the Year\" by a local newspaper. However, Onassis had greater ambitions than being recognized for her beauty and popularity. She wrote in the yearbook that her life ambition was \"not to be a housewife.\"\n\nUpon graduating from Miss Porter's School Onassis enrolled at Vassar College in New York to study history, literature, art and French. She spent her junior year studying abroad in Paris. \"I loved it more than any year of my life,\" Onassis later wrote about her time there. \"Being away from home gave me a chance to look at myself with a jaundiced eye. I learned not to be ashamed of a real hunger for knowledge, something that I had always tried to hide, and I came home glad to start in here again but with a love for Europe that I am afraid will never leave me.\"\n\nUpon returning from Paris, Onassis transferred to George Washington University in Washington, D.C., and graduated with a B.A. in French literature in 1951. After graduating from college in 1951, Onassis landed a job as the \"Inquiring Camera Girl\" for the Washington Times-Herald newspaper. Her job was to photograph and interview various Washington residents, and then weave their pictures and responses together in her column. Among her most notable stories were an interview with Richard Nixon, coverage of President Dwight D. Eisenhower's inauguration and a report on the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nU.S. First Lady\n\nIt was at a dinner party in 1952 that Onassis met a dashing young congressman and senator-elect from Massachusetts named John F. Kennedy; he \"leaned across the asparagus and asked her for a date.\" They were married a year later, on September 12, 1953. Onassis gave birth to her first child, Caroline Kennedy, in 1957. That same year, she encouraged Kennedy to write and, subsequently, helped him edit Profiles in Courage, his famous book about U.S. senators who had risked their careers to stand for causes they believed in.\n\nIn January 1960, John F. Kennedy announced his candidacy for the U.S. presidency. Although Onassis was pregnant at the time and thus unable to join him on the campaign trail, she campaigned tirelessly from home. She answered letters, gave interviews, taped commercials and wrote a weekly syndicated newspaper column called \"Campaign Wife.\"\n\nOn November 8, 1960, Kennedy defeated Richard Nixon by a razor-thin margin to become the 35th president of the United States; less three weeks later, Onassis gave birth to their second child, John Fitzgerald Kennedy Jr. The couple had a third child, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy born prematurely on August 7, 1963, but lost the child two days later.\n\nOnassis's first mission as first lady was to transform the White House into a museum of American history and culture that would inspire patriotism and public service in those who visited. \"Every boy who comes here should see things that develop his sense of history,\" she once said. Onassis went to extraordinary lengths to procure art and furniture owned by past presidents\u2014including artifacts owned by George Washington, James Madison and Abraham Lincoln\u2014as well as pieces she considered representative of various periods of American culture. \"Everything in the White House must have a reason for being there,\" she insisted. \"It would be sacrilege merely to 'redecorate' it\u2014a word I hate. It must be restored\u2014and that has nothing to do with decoration. That is a question of scholarship.\"\n\nAs the culmination of her project, Onassis gave a tour of the restored White House on national television on February 14, 1962. A record 56 million viewers watched her televised special, and Onassis won an honorary Emmy Award for her performance.\n\nAs first lady, Onassis was also a great patron of the arts. In addition to the officials, diplomats and statesman who typically populated state dinners, Onassis also invited the nation's leading writers, artists, musicians and scientists to mingle with its top politicians. The great violinist Isaac Stern wrote to Onassis after one such dinner, \"It would be difficult to tell you how refreshing, how heartening it is to find such serious attention and respect for the arts in the White House. To many of us it is one of the most exciting developments on the present American cultural scene.\"\n\nAdditionally, Onassis frequently traveled abroad, both with the president and alone, and her deep knowledge of foreign cultures and languages (she spoke fluent French, Spanish and Italian) helped garner goodwill toward America. She was so adoringly received in France that President Kennedy introduced himself as \"the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris.\" Presidential advisor Clark Clifford wrote to Onassis, \"Once in a great while, an individual will capture the imagination of people all over the world. You have done this; and what is more important, through your graciousness and tact, you have transformed this rare accomplishment into an incredibly important asset to this nation.\""}
{"label": true, "txt": "Chester Bennington Toxicology Report Surfaces Following Linkin Park Singer's Suicide\n\nThe tragic, unexpected death of Linkin Park singer Chester Bennington was ruled a suicide by hanging on July 20, when his body was discovered in his Los Angeles home. On Tuesday (Dec. 5), further details have emerged detailing the conditions of Bennington\u2019s death, via autopsy and toxicology results.\n\nThe findings, published through TMZ, show \"a trace amount\" of alcohol in the singer's system at the time of death. An earlier version of this story reported MDMA (ecstasy) was also detected, though TMZ now asserts that after Bennington's blood tested \"presumptive positive\" for the drug, two subsequent tests disproved this. A prescription bottle of Zolpidem (the generic version of the sleep aid Ambien) and a small amount of beer was also found in Bennington\u2019s bedroom.\n\nThe report coincides with June\u2019s suicide report. \u201cAutopsy findings are characteristic of suicidal hanging,\u201d deputy medical examiner Dr. Christopher Rogers\u2019 report reads. \u201cThere was a history of suicidal ideation [in Bennington].\u201c\n\nThe Linkin Park frontman had battled depression and alcoholism throughout his life and attended rehab in 2006. According to his longtime friend Ryan Shuck (who played guitar in Bennington\u2019s side project Dead by Sunrise) he had been six months sober at one point in 2017. While his friends said he was in good spirits and planning for the future through much of this year and last, he had also suffered alcoholic relapses over that time.\n\nOn Oct. 27, members of Linkin Park, Blink-182, No Doubt and numerous other stars held a tribute concert in Bennington\u2019s honor at Los Angeles\u2019 Hollywood Bowl. On Dec. 15, LP plans to release One More Light Live, featuring 2017 recordings from the band\u2019s final shows with its fallen singer."}

Faces in the crowd included Netflix\u2019s Ted Sarandos, CBS\u2019 Leslie Moonves and Paramount\u2019s Jim Gianopulos, just to name a few.\n\nDiane Keaton, last year\u2019s AFI honoree, took the stage early to marvel at Clooney\u2019s distant relationship with former president Abraham Lincoln and rib him over that \u201cKiller Tomatoes\u201d sequel he\u2019s never quite lived down. Laura Dern remembered cutting her teeth with Clooney in failed horror project \u201cGrizzly II: The Concert.\u201d Jimmy Kimmel, returning to the Dolby stage for the first time since the 90th annual Academy Awards in March, regaled with stories of \u201crascal\u201d Clooney\u2019s infamous practical jokes, which have apparently included sending packages to Brad Pitt labeled \u201cthe porn that you ordered.\u201d\n\n\u201cFriends\u201d stars Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox went ahead and took credit for Clooney\u2019s rise thanks to their hit NBC show being the lead-in for \u201cER\u201d all those years ago. \u201cWithout us you\u2019re \u2018Chicago Hope,\u2019 buddy,\u201d Cox quipped. Meanwhile a teary-eyed Julianna Margulies told the story of her \u201cER\u201d character\u2019s original fate in the pilot (she was to die of a drug overdose), and how Clooney went to bat for her to stick around with a recurring role. Clooney \u2014 his wife Amal by his side, the pair flanked by actor Bill Murray and Clooney\u2019s father Nick \u2014 was visibly touched by her comments.\n\nRelated George Clooney: Trump's America Fearful, Not Great DP Newton Thomas Sigel Has Emerged as a Master of Multiple Styles and Genres\n\nIn video packages filmed at Cinecitta Studios in Rome, where Clooney is in pre-production on his upcoming \u201cCatch-22\u201d adaptation, the Oscar-winning multi-hyphenate recalled how his cousin, the late actor Miguel Ferrer, coaxed Clooney out to the west coast for a stab at acting. Clooney also commended \u201cFrom Dusk Till Dawn\u201d director Robert Rodriguez for giving him a real break in movies and noted the wake-up call of 1997 superhero stinker \u201cBatman & Robin,\u201d which made him realize he needed to focus as much on the creative aspects of his projects as on his own work in front of the camera.\n\nThe clip that drew the biggest burst of applause from those gathered in the ballroom and the mezzanine above was Joel and Ethan Coen\u2019s \u201cO Brother, Where Art Thou?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve played four idiots for them,\u201d Clooney said of his work with the sibling filmmakers. \u201cThey saw in me the brilliance of my idiocy.\u201d Miley Cyrus even stopped by with a back-up band wielding fiddles and banjos for a rendition of the film\u2019s hit arrangement of \u201cMan of Constant Sorrow.\u201d\n\nClooney\u2019s ties to journalism (via his father\u2019s newsroom background) and commitment to philanthropy through aid to Darfur, Haiti and post-Katrina New Orleans, among other causes, became something of a recurring theme. AFI trustee Howard Stringer even evoked Clooney\u2019s 2005 Oscar-nominated biopic \u201cGood Night, and Good Luck,\u201d which centered on pioneering newsman Edward R. Murrow. Calling the drama \u201ceerily prophetic,\u201d Stringer deemed it a movie that \u201cshould be required for modern journalists, as well as modern politicians.\u201d\n\nDon Cheadle recalled something Clooney once told him about having a platform such as he does: \u201cIf they\u2019re going to put the cameras on me, then I\u2019m going to take them to where the cameras should be.\u201d Clooney, meanwhile, spoke in the pre-taped material about his affinity for reluctant heroes and characters who stood up against the system in films like \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird,\u201d \u201cHigh Noon,\u201d \u201cThree Days of the Condor\u201d and \u201cThe Verdict.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe learned to question things from my father,\u201d the night\u2019s honoree said of the elder Clooney, who offered his own toast near the end of the evening that brought his son close to tears.\n\nAnd for the first time publicly, Amal Clooney also spoke about her husband. \u201cComing here I knew there would be lots of people who could speak to George\u2019s talent,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I thought I should say a few words about his character. He is a gentleman in every sense of the word and a way that seems so rare these days and perhaps outdated. Everyone who knows him will tell you he has not forgotten his Kentucky manners. On every set I visit his crews tell me he stands up for the most vulnerable.\u201d\n\nOther speakers included Murray, Richard Kind, Anna Kendrick, Cate Blanchett and, via pre-taped well-wishes, Julia Roberts and former president Barack Obama.\n\n\u201cI love being a part of this industry and community,\u201d Clooney said when he finally took the stage to close out the night. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of the much overdue changes I\u2019m seeing now, and above all I want to thank everyone who came out tonight to say such beautiful things \u2026 and Jimmy Kimmel. I love every rotten one of you.\u201d Actress Shirley MacLaine presented him with the AFI honor.\n\nClooney is an eight-time Oscar nominee across multiple disciplines (acting, directing, producing and writing). He won the film Academy\u2019s supporting actor prize for his performance in 2005\u2019s \u201cSyriana\u201d and the best picture award for Ben Affleck\u2019s 2012 thriller \u201cArgo.\u201d He and Amal welcomed twins almost exactly a year ago.\n\nThat was just another of Clooney\u2019s practical jokes, Kimmel quipped. \u201cOn Amal\u2019s uterus.\u201d\n\nHonored earlier in the evening with AFI\u2019s Franklin J. Schaffner Award, for accomplished alumni, was \u201cMudbound\u201d and \u201cBlack Panther\u201d cinematographer Rachel Morrison. Morrison, who became the first woman ever nominated for a cinematography Oscar earlier this year, noted how when she attended the institute, there were six women in a class of 28, \u201cwhich seemed progressive at the time.\u201d She praised AFI\u2019s commitment to closing the gap on 50/50 gender parity in its program.

I'm in the hallway, I'm getting ambushed by people with friends that come to the show and having me sign this and do this.\n\n'I just said, \"Wait a minute.\" And in hindsight, I probably should've handled it a little bit differently.'\n\nThe email was sent to production staff of the Steve Harvey show at the beginning of the current season.\n\nA copy was obtained by media blogger Robert Feder, surfaced on Wednesday. Production for the show ended on Thursday.\n\n'I'd like you all to review and adhere to the following notes and rules for Season 5 of my talk show,' the email to staff began.\n\n'There will be no meetings in my dressing room. No stopping by or popping in. NO ONE. Do not come to my dressing room unless invited.'\n\nThe 60-year-old went on to say that anyone who opens the door to his dressing room would be removed by his security team.\n\nHarvey (pictured above hosting the Miss Universe pageant in Manila on January 30, 2017) will launch a new talk show on NBC entitled Steve in September, which will be filmed in Los Angeles\n\nThey would also stop anyone from standing outside the dressing room with the hope of speaking to the TV host.\n\n'I want all the ambushing to stop now. That includes TV staff. You must schedule an appointment.\n\n'Do not approach me while I'm in the makeup chair unless I ask to speak with you directly. Either knock or use the doorbell.\n\n'I am seeking more free time for me throughout the day.\n\n'Do not wait in any hallway to speak to me. I hate being ambushed. Please make an appointment. I promise you I will not entertain you in the hallway, and do not attempt to walk with me.'\n\nThe author signed off the email asking staff not to take offense to his new way of doing business.\n\nThe comedian will launch a new talk show on NBC entitled Steve in September, which will be filmed in Los Angeles.\n\nHe had already been flying between Chicago and Los Angeles due to other hosting commitments, including Family Feud and Big Little Shots.\n\n'STEVE is going to be different than my current daytime show. The new location will allow me to welcome more celebrity guests and more importantly let me do what I enjoy doing best, being funny,' Harvey said in a statement announcing the new show.\n\nRadarOnline reported last week that Harvey had sacked his Chicago-based staff and had hired all new crew in LA for his new day time show.\n\nSources told the outlet that current employees had been willing to move with Harvey to California but weren't given the chance.\n\n'He didn't offer interviews to many people who have been with him since beginning, and hurt lots of people who would move on their own to LA to be part of the new show,' one employee said.\n\n'Steve never even addressed the staff about it. He never said a word about them all losing their jobs. These are die-hard loyal staff members.\n\n'The staff were told by the Executive Producer, not Steve. The EP said that Steve would talk to them and then he never did. Not even an email saying 'thanks for what you do', or 'good luck.'"}

I was to audition for Monica and I very much liked Della Reese, who of course ended up playing Tess.[11] \u201d\n\nDowney has also spoken of her deep and lasting love for and friendship with Della Reese.[12] The two remained close until Reese's death on November 19, 2017.[13] She commented that Reese was \"such an influence on my life.

{"label": true, "txt": "[This story contains spoilers from the series finale of A&E's Bates Motel.]\n\nAfter five seasons, numerous deaths and a dark decent into madness, the world of A&E's Bates Motel came to a close Monday with an expected yet heartbreaking series finale.\n\nIn \u201cThe Cord,\u201d the death toll continued to rise. Romero (Nestor Carbonell) fulfilled his death wish when he forced \"Norman\" (Freddie Highmore) to show him where he'd left Norma\u2019s (Vera Farmiga) body. Only Norman \u2014 who was still \"Mother\" at that point \u2014 killed Romero as he was sobbing over Norma's corpse.\n\nBut before Romero breathed his last breath, he reminded Norman of his actions \u2014 that he was the one responsible for killing his beloved mother. As a result, \u201cMother\u201d left Norman behind, saying he no longer needed her now that he knew everything. It was enough to send Norman into a lonely tailspin and revert his damaged mind all the way back to the time of the pilot, when he and Norma first traveled to White Pine Bay and opened their infamous motel.\n\nHoping against hope for everything to revert back to normal, Norman dragged his mother\u2019s body to the motel and into the house and called his brother Dylan (Max Thieriot) to come over for dinner as though nothing had happened. In the end, Dylan knew that he was the only one left standing who cared about Norman\u2019s well-being and opted not to call the authorities. Instead, Dylan attempted to bring Norman in himself.\n\nUnfortunately, the only thing Norman wanted in the end was to be reunited with his mother, even if it meant he had to die. So in a twisted suicide attempt, Norman rushed at a gun-wielding Dylan with a knife, forcing his brother to shoot and kill him.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d Norman muttered as his last words as Dylan held his dying brother.\n\nTo break down the series finale and what went into crafting the ultimate ending, The Hollywood Reporter caught up with co-showrunners Cartlon Cuse and Kerry Ehrin.\n\nHow much of this was the ending you planned from the start? How much changed over the years?\n\nEhrin: We\u2019d always thought of this as a love story. A very weird, warped, dark, love story. In the end, it felt like even if we were reuniting them in death that they had to be reunited. Even if it was lying next to each other in earth for all eternity. That was the driving destination emotionally. The Dylan story became part of that, and him being the one that ushers Norman out of the world felt fitting.\n\nCuse: We came to the idea later that Dylan would be the one to usher Norman out of the world at Norman\u2019s bequest. But from when we first started talking about the show, we imagined a five-year journey that would end with Norman and Norma both dead. Ultimately, we felt their love story could just not succeed in this world.\n\nAre viewers meant to feel as though Norman wanted Dylan to kill him?\n\nCuse: He\u2019s coming at Dylan with a knife; I mean, Dylan doesn\u2019t have a choice.\n\nEhrin: He wants to be put out of his misery at that point. When Norman goes over to the sink and picks up the knife, you can see all these ideas playing in his head of what he\u2019s supposed to do now that he\u2019s been told that Norma is dead; she doesn\u2019t exist, and he\u2019s not going to get her back, and there\u2019s no pretending your way out of this. It\u2019s a beautiful performance, because you see all these things play through him. He doesn\u2019t quite know what he\u2019s doing when he picks up the knife and starts walking toward Dylan. He\u2019s working it out as he\u2019s walking.\n\nCuse: It\u2019s always a bit of a double-edged sword to talk about stuff afterward. It\u2019s fine for people to have their own interpretation of what happened at the end. Most of the audience will have that experience. It wasn\u2019t intentionally ambiguous, but you can draw your own line and make a decision as to what degree Norman is egging him on and to what degree can Dylan stop himself. There was a certain messy, tragic quality to that final encounter that we love.\n\nEhrin: Messy tragedy has been our hallmark. We like to not over-define things. We like to throw it out there and wade around it.\n\nWere you going for an Of Mice and Men vibe?\n\nEhrin: Yes. That\u2019s dead on. That was definitely an inspiration in early discussions. The idea of a mercy killing that was also heartbreaking.\n\nCuse: There\u2019s a poignancy in Norman having a brief moment of clarity that gives him perspective. If you think of the distorted mental state Norman is in when he invites Dylan to come to dinner and has Norma kind of propped up on the table, there was a real poignancy in having Norman realize that all avenues were closed to him. He doesn\u2019t want to go to a mental institution, he can\u2019t exist in this world, he\u2019s in a degrading mental state. There was no other solution for him.\n\nWhy didn\u2019t Emma (Olivia Cooke) call the police when she knew Dylan was going into the house?\n\nEhrin: She actually did in one draft. It was an editing decision in post. Once you get Dylan into that house, you just wanted to stay with him and be with that and not cut away to something else.\n\nCuse: It\u2019s fair in a situation like this that characters don\u2019t always do the most logical thing. Obviously, if Emma calls the cops, it really mutes the conclusion that we felt was best for the show, and it felt fair and reasonable that in that moment she defers and doesn\u2019t do it.\n\nOnce you introduced Marion Crane (Rihanna), were Norman\u2019s days numbered?\n\nCuse: There were a couple of guiding principles. We absolutely did not want to end the show in the same way as Psycho. That would have been a profound disappointment and it would deflate the whole intention here, which was to take characters and some of the iconographic imagery from the movie and tell its own story. Our story had its own ending, and so we enjoyed the fun of crossing in and out of the mythology of Psycho at the end. Particularly when we cast Rihanna, we leaned into the fact that the audience would come to it with these very specific expectations based on the movie, and we wanted to flip their expectations on their ear. That was fun to do, but as far as the ending goes, we were never judging it against the ending in Psycho or felt an obligation to connect it to the ending of Psycho. Our obligation at the end was to hopefully have this tragic love story come to a satisfying ending. Sad can be satisfying. We knew it wouldn\u2019t be happy, but we hoped it would be satisfying.\n\nPsycho aside, was there any point where you second-guessed your decision to kill Norman?\n\nEhrin: No. Certainly a part of you wants to somehow have everything turn out OK just because you love the characters. But this is closer to Wuthering Heights than Harvey. There\u2019s an ending where Norman just walks off into the hills talking to his mother and the sun goes down and everyone\u2019s happy. In my head, that kind of exists, but that wasn\u2019t what we were delivering.\n\nWhen Norma leaves Norman following Romero\u2019s death, does that close the door on his mental defense case in these murders?\n\nEhrin: Yes, because he\u2019s alone. He doesn\u2019t have that buffer anymore, and he can\u2019t deal with it. It pushes him over the edge, and it leads him on this journey to recall the past and kind of redo it.\n\nHow did you come up with the idea to reincorporate the pilot into the episode?\n\nCuse: One of the things that\u2019s always satisfying in finales is to remind audiences of the journey they\u2019ve been on. There\u2019s a resonance in rewarding an audience that has watched all 50 episodes of our show with a sense of that journey. Some of it arose from those feelings. It was also a way to make the love story feel epic. The thing that makes something epic is its existence across a large spread of time. We wanted to reconnect the audience to the fact that this love story and relationship was a lifelong journey.\n\nWhen did you decide that Dylan, Emma and their daughter would live in the sun?\n\nEhrin: That instinct first came at the end of the second season.\n\nCuse: We realized the show was heading in a very dark direction, and we felt it was important to have some ray of hope at the end of our narrative. It became clear that early that Dylan and Emma deserved to come out of this with a relatively happy ending.\n\nEhrin: There was something really interesting toward the end of the second season to have these two people who were both really outside of the Norma-Norman island and couldn\u2019t get on it, that they would find each other and miraculously make their own world together. It made us happy to think about, and it became something that was fun to work toward in the writing. You do try to balance it \u2014 even on a purely selfish level for your own self. When you\u2019re living inside of this stuff, it\u2019s very dark, and it\u2019s nice to have strands of hope to hold onto. That played out even in writing Norma and Norman, because you would constantly have to put yourself in denial about the ending. You wanted to always infuse them with hope that things would be better. That they were going to work out of it. It\u2019s an interesting process to write that. It\u2019s very emotionally and physically taxing\u2026it's bizarre.\n\nWas there any talk of having that last shot be the daughter giving the camera a creepy Norman Bates-type smile, rather than ending it on a happier note?\n\nCuse: That will be the sequel.\n\nEhrin: We joked about that in the writers' room, that she would be like Baby Norma, but that she would be evil. But no. The kid is good, and Dylan and Emma are good.\n\nWhat did you think of the series finale of Bates Motel? Sound off in the comments below.

Johansson was one of the first actresses to wear the high-fashion label to a major red carpet event since news of Weinstein\u2019s sexual misconduct scandal broke last fall.\n\nAndVogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, who has long hosted the Costume Institute\u2019s benefit at New York City\u2019s Metropolitan Museum of Art, fully supported Johansson\u2019s decision.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\n\u201cI totally agree with that,\u201d Wintour said during a visit to The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. \u201cGeorgina is a brilliant designer and I don\u2019t think she should be blamed for her husband\u2019s behavior.\n\n\u201cI think it was a great gesture of support on Scarlett\u2019s part to wear a dress like that, a beautiful dress like that, on such a public occasion,\u201d she added.\n\nLooking for more style content?

She attended the annual event alongside her newly-confirmed boyfriend and SNL star Colin Jost.\n\nRELATED: The Met Gala\u2019s Most Unbelievable Style Moments: See 120+ Stunning Stars on Fashion\u2019s Biggest Red Carpet\n\nScarlett Johansson and Colin Jost Andrew H. Walker/REX/Shutterstock\n\nOn Tuesday, Johansson stood by her choice to wear a Marchesa gown.\n\n\u201cI wore Marchesa because their clothes make women feel confident and beautiful and it is my pleasure to support a brand created by two incredibly talented and important female designers,\u201d Johansson said in a statement to PEOPLE, who selected a romantic off-the-shoulder burgundy gown featuring a tulle skirt embellished with floral appliqu\u00e9s.\n\nMarchesa echoed a similar sentiment in the following statement to PEOPLE: \u201cWe are truly honored that Scarlett chose to wear Marchesa for the Met Gala. She is an amazingly talented actor who has incredible style and presence. It was wonderful to work so closely with her in creating this custom look.\u201d\n\nHarvey Weinstein and Georgina Chapman Gisela Schober/Getty\n\nSince the news about Weinstein broke, Marchesa\u2019s fate as one of Hollywood\u2019s go-to labels has been questioned by some in the industry.\n\nFemale stars of Weinstein\u2019s films often wore Marchesa designs on the red carpet, and Chapman and Weinstein\u2019s businesses were often linked. A few stars, including Jessica Chastain, claimed that Weinstein would pressure them to wear his wife\u2019s designs. In Chastain\u2019s case, she said he mocked her when she didn\u2019t do so.\n\n\u201cThey absolutely had a push from Harvey,\u201d writer Neil Gaiman, a friend of Chapman\u2019s, told Vogue in an interview published Thursday. \u201cBut you cannot hype something from nothing and make it last. And Harvey\u2019s hyping worked because George is actually an artist. I\u2019ve watched her at work and been impressed and fascinated. She has a vision, and she\u2019s really good at it.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Georgina Chapman, Harvey Weinstein Prenup Revealed: She Could Get Nearly $12 Million in Divorce\n\nAfter Weinstein and Chapman agreed to a divorce settlement in January (they haven\u2019t yet publicly filed for divorce), Marchesa canceled its runway show at New York Fashion Week.\n\nThey also didn\u2019t offer any dresses to celebrities for awards season \u2014 something Chapman told Vogue was her decision alone. \u201cWe didn\u2019t feel it was appropriate given the situation,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the women who have been hurt deserve dignity and respect, so I want to give it the time it deserves. It\u2019s a time for mourning, really.\u201d\n\nThe brand, however, is continuing its business. Chapman and co-founder Keren Craig even recently released a lookbook of pre-fall 2018 designs and announced it would be debuting a Fall 2018 line in a new format."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Red alert, Peter stans, because there is a potentially discouraging development regarding the next season of The Bachelor. The emperor of Bachelor Nation made a not-so-cryptic declaration about who won\u2019t be the next Bachelor, and things aren\u2019t looking good for the runner-up of The Bachelorette Season 13. On Thursday, Bachelor creator Mike Fleiss tweeted, \u201cDo we really want a Bachelor who isn't ready to settle down with a woman he loves? Hmmm. Not what #thebachelor is all about.\u201d Uh-oh. By \u201cisn\u2019t ready to settle down,\u201d does Fleiss mean \u201cisn\u2019t ready to propose at the end of a season of a dating competition series\u201d? Did Fleiss just rule out the possibility of Peter Kraus being the next Bachelor? Sure seems like it.\n\nFleiss wouldn\u2019t be the first person affiliated with the franchise to state that Kraus isn\u2019t a good fit for the program. On the finale of The Bachelorette Season 13, Rachel Lindsay said the following to Kraus: \u201cI just don't think this world, this show, is for you.\"\n\nWhy, oh why would Lindsay say such a thing? Probably because Kraus told Lindsay, like, a thousand times that he would not be ready to propose at the end of the season. And probably because the season finale proposal is a huge component of The Bachelor/ette.\n\nOutside of The Bachelor/ette universe, Kraus's refusal to propose isn't that weird; getting engaged to someone after only a few one-on-one dates could seem rushed. However, this is The Bachelor/ette, a program that ramps up to a proposal every season. Much like the phrase \"Can I steal you for a second?\" and group dates that involve performing choreography in front of a crowd, the possibility of a proposal is part of what contestants sign up for. It would sort of be like getting to the Project Runway finale, only to be like, \u201cEh, you know what? I\u2019m not ready for Fashion Week. I need more time. So, uh, you can cancel my runway show.\u201d\n\nAssuming Fleiss's tweet is indeed about Kraus, it seems like the show creator isn't raring to nominate the Wisconsin native for The Bachelor Season 22. On the bright side, there are a lot of other solid candidates for The Bachelor, including the darling Dean Unglert or the wonderful Eric Bigger. My TV set would happily give either of those gents a rose."}

She\u2019s kept an unusually low profile over the past few months, posting sporadically on social media and making few public appearances."}

Drama.\n\nEvery relationship has its ups and downs, but when we\u2019re talking about Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez, that\u2019s approximately seven years of roller-coaster emotions.\n\nThe two sparked dating rumours in 2010 and captured the hearts of both their fan bases, resulting in the #Jelena hashtag. Since Bieber and Gomez are two of the most famous young stars of their time, their admirers range from supportive to downright obsessive.\n\nTheir relationship is kind of very hard to follow, but luckily, we\u2019ve broken down every single one of their breakups and makeups. Grab a snack, because there\u2019s a lot to dive into.\n\nphotography via instagram.com/jelena_firstofall\n\nJanuary 2011: Vacation in St. Lucia\n\nBieber/Gomez dating rumours began to circulate in 2010.

Oh, young love.\n\nphotography by steve granitz/contributor/getty\n\nNovember 2011: Jelena is over\u2026 apparently\n\nRumours that Gomez has dumped the Canadian pop star begin to surface, after a Bieber fan claimed she had sex with him backstage at a show in October 2010, and that he is the father of her 4-month-old child. However, it\u2019s confirmed that the breakup rumours aren\u2019t true.\n\nphotography via pinterest\n\nNovember 2012: The couple officially breaks up; Bieber briefly linked to model Barbara Palvin\n\nDon\u2019t go anywhere, this is just the first of many breakups. After more than a year of puppy love, the two reportedly split for the first time as a result of their jam-packed schedules. Fans (and the internet) also begin to wonder whether there\u2019s a relationship brewing between JB and Victoria\u2019s Secret model Barbara Palvin. Palvin took to Twitter, confirming that there was nothing going on between her and Bieber.\n\nphotography via instagram.com/ashilrd\n\nJanuary 2013: The pair are reportedly back together; Gomez travels to Norway to visit Bieber\n\nThey clearly can\u2019t stay away from one another for long. Less than 3 months after the duo called it quits, Bieber posted the above image of them on his Instagram\u2026 and of course, promptly deleted it.\n\nPhotography by Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nNovember 2014: Gomez performs at the American Music Awards\n\nThe singer took to the stage to perform her single, \u201cThe Heart Wants What It Wants.\u201d Here\u2019s the kicker: she confirmed the song was about Bieber. After a few more on-again off-again appearances in the media, the couple officially confirmed they\u2019d split.\n\nphotography via instagram.com/mommyhaileybaldwin\n\n\n\nDecember 2014: Bieber denies Hailey Baldwin dating rumours\n\nJelena, what? We\u2019re now onto Jailey. Talks that Bieber is dating model Hailey Baldwin are at a high. However, JB denies these rumours, assuring fans that they are simply good friends (whatever that means).\n\nphotography via instagram.com/zedd\n\nJanuary 2015: Gomez and Zedd dating rumours begin\n\nShortly after the Jailey rumours came out, Gomez was seen getting close with DJ Zedd. This romance was not confirmed until later that year in September, when Gomez spoke with Elle for an interview.\n\nphotography via instagram.com/selenamylight\n\nSeptember 2015: Gomez opens up about Bieber in ELLE\n\nGomez discusses her past relationship with her fellow pop star and states that she will always support him.\n\nphotography via instagram.com/selgselgenator\n\nNovember 2015: Bieber appears on The Ellen DeGeneres Show\n\nIn November 2015, JB stopped by Ellen, and while discussing his upcoming album Purpose, he revealed which songs were inspired by Selena\u2014thanks for the intel, Biebs! The songs?

Yes, but now things appear to have changed. The two celebs took their romance public on Instagram. However, it\u2019s unclear how long the this romance lasted, as they\u2019ve since broken up.\n\nphotography via instagram.com/sofiarichie\n\nAugust 2016: Sofia Richie posts an Instagram of her and Bieber\n\nYes, Sofia Richie, daughter of Lionel Richie, and sister of Nicole Richie. Bieber and Richie both took to Instagram recently to post photos of their time in Japan.

An official cover has yet to be released; however, suspicions that it\u2019s coming soon have been heightened as DJ Snake posted a longer version of Gomez\u2019s cover on his Snapchat. I think we can all agree that it\u2019s a little odd of Selena to chose to cover her ex\u2019s song after feuding over his new boo Sofia. But hey, you do you, Selena!\n\nphotography via instagram.com/revivaltour\n\nNovember 2016: Bieber allegedly visits Gomez in rehab\n\nGomez pulled out of her Revival Tour, in late August, due to complications caused by Lupus; mainly symptoms surrounding anxiety and panic. As a result, she checks in to rehab facility (feel better soon, Selena!). Rumours of Bieber visiting Gomez in rehab have started to circulate.

According to the celeb news site, Gomez and The Weeknd (real name: Abel Tesfaye) were \u201cgetting handsy and mouthy\u201d outside Giorgio Baldi restaurant in Santa Monica, Calif. They then made it Instagram official (sort of) during a trip to Italy where the pair were spotted wining and dining (and kissing, duh!) in Venice and Florence.\n\nPhotography by Charley Gallay/AMA2015/Getty Images for dcp\n\nFebruary 2017: JB and The Weeknd begin to feud\n\nWhile out in Los Angeles, Bieber was asked by paparazzi if he would listen The Weeknd\u2019s music, to which he responded with a simple \u201cHell, no.\u201d Fast forward to Valentine\u2019s Day, when a track called \u201cSome Way\u201d by Toronto rapper Nav, featuring The Weeknd drops. \u201cI think your girl / think your girl / fell in love with me,\u201d the singer croons. The song also delves into NSFW territory: \u201cShe say my fuck and my tongue game a remedy.\u201d Yikes! A day later, DJ Kygo\u2019s single \u201cIt Ain\u2019t Me\u201d drops, featuring Gomez, and let\u2019s just say the lyrics appear to allude to a certain former flame. Serious. Drama.\n\nPhotography via Instagram/_marissamarino\n\nApril 30, 2017: Selena reportedly pens a JB diss-track\n\nThe Sun reports that Gomez and singer/songwriter Charli XCX have collaborated on a track titled \u201cBad Girlfriend.\u201d The British tabloid speculates that the song is about Justin Bieber, and states that a source has told them that it\u2019s \u201c\u2026about a boyfriend the girl is no longer really into and has finally gotten wise to.\u201d One of the alleged lines, according to The Sun is: \u201cI know I\u2019m not there for you or there when you call. I\u2019m a bad girlfriend/I\u2019m a bad girlfriend.\u201d So. Much. Shade.\n\nPhotography via Instagram/selenagomez\n\nMay 2017: Selena promotes new single on Instagram\n\nLast week, Gomez took to her Instagram to tease fans with news of her upcoming single. The singer posted a trio of highly-stylized (read: dark, moody) images featuring the words \u201cBad Liar\u201d scrawled with lipstick on a mirror. As a result, many are speculating that the song must be about her (surprise!) infamous ex-boyfriend. What we can confirm is that the track is scheduled to drop May 18.\n\nJune 2017: Selena compliments Justin on a radio talk show.\n\nDuring an interview on Sirius XM\u2019s Morning Mash Up, \u200bSelena was asked \u200bto share \u200bher thoughts on Ariana Grande\u2019s #OneLoveManchester benefit concert\u200b. Turns out \u200bshe had nothing but \u200bgood things to say about the performers, including Justin.\n\n\u201cIt was beautiful,\u201d says Selena. \u201cI thought everyone did such a beautiful job. It was so gorgeous. I love how she [Ariana] ended it. I thought Justin did great. It was really beautiful.\u201d Cue the wild screams tweets from Jelena fans.\n\nJELENA IS RISING AGAIN YOU GUYS pic.twitter.com/ea9zylAaSZ \u2014 rip jelena 2010-2018 (@thorsodn) June 5, 2017\n\nPhotography by Kevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nJune 2017: A Selena and Justin duet reportedly leaked on Soundcloud\n\nThe two recorded an incomplete single called \u201cSteal Our Love\u201d back in 2013/2014 before their final breakup. While the song is no longer available to listen to (it was leaked and then swiftly taken off of Soundcloud), the Jelena fans over at Elle has kindly provided us the lyrics. And judging from the lines, the songs tells the story of two people in a troubled relationship who are fighting to make it work.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t seem to choose what to do / There\u2019s nothing I can say / I\u2019m tired of the fight \u2019cause I\u2019m never right / I just wanna cry, no,\u201d Selena allegedly sings.\n\nSounds familiar?\n\nPhotography via Instagram/@justinbieber\n\nAugust 2017: Justin releases a new song titled \u201cFriends\u201d\n\n\u201cCan we still be friends?\u201d Bieber asks on his latest track with Bloodpop. He\u2019s singing to to an ex who he swears he\u2019s over but can\u2019t quite completely, and (obviously) fans assume he\u2019s singing to Selena. The plot thickened when people started realizing that Julia Michaels, a good friend of Selena, co-wrote the single. Hmmm\u2026could this be the start of a healthy post-romance friendship?\n\nPhotography via Twitter/@heardtroye\n\nAugust 2017: Nude photos of Justin are posted to Selena\u2019s Instagram\n\nWith 125 million followers, Selena Gomez is the most followed person on Instagram. So when hackers posted nude photos of her ex-bf to her account, a LOT of people noticed. When Selena\u2019s team clued in, they swiftly took down her page to remove the NSFW photos and re-secure her account. Gomez\u2019s Instagram was back online minutes later, with the nude pics deleted.\n\nThe explicit photos posted aren\u2019t new: these are the same Bieber images that were published after the pop star\u2019s Bora Bora vacation in 2015. Obviously, that doesn\u2019t make it okay\u2014we should never look a someone\u2019s naked body without their consent.\n\nOctober 2017: Justin and Selena spotted hanging out at Gomez\u2019s home\n\nLooks like Bieber\u2019s song \u201cFriends\u201d really was about Selena! At the end of October, Justin was spotted at his ex-girlfriend\u2019s home in California. According to TMZ, Jelena spent time with mutual friends, and Selena\u2019s current boyfriend, The Weeknd, was fully aware of the hangout. TMZ also reports Justin and Selena first reconnected around the time Gomez announced she\u2019d undergone a kidney transplant. All\u2019s well that ends well!\n\nOctober 2017: Justin and Selena go to church together\n\nIt was Sunday Funday for Jelena, with the former lovers spending the full day together on Oct. 29, 2017. According to TMZ, Justin and Selena first attended church service together before grabbing a bite to eat at Joi Cafe in Westlake Village, California. The exes reportedly left together, and Biebs showed up at Selena\u2019s doorstep later that evening. A Sunday well spent brings a week of content!\n\nOctober 2017: Selena is single, and Justin is THRILLED\n\nSound the alarms! According to a source via People, the \u201cSorry\u201d singer is \u201chappy Selena is single. He hopes to regain her trust so they can get back together.\u201d According to Bieber\u2019s \u201cclose friend\u201d/wingman, \u201cIt seems their relationship now is very different. Justin is certainly a much better person. He would be a better boyfriend, too.\u201d Maybe Justin\u2019s song \u201cFriends\u201d wasn\u2019t about Selena after all\u2026\n\nNovember 2017: Justin and Selena get pretty cozy\n\nWell these two aren\u2019t wasting any time are they? Jelena hung out in L.A. AGAIN the morning of November 1: They\u2019re biking, they\u2019re laughing, they\u2019re nuzzling into one another, and it\u2019s ALL going down in front of photographers. It\u2019s not PDA, but it\u2019s pretty close. All we need now is an Insta official pic from @justinbieber or @selenagomez.\n\nNovember 2017: Selena wears Justin\u2019s hockey jersey\n\nSelena Gomez wearing Justin Bieber's hockey jersey is the Canadian equivalent of getting engaged, right? pic.twitter.com/Xr3SdQTSfq \u2014 Erica Steiner (@SendARavenPlz) November 2, 2017\n\nOkay, so it\u2019s not a PDA social media post \u2014 but it\u2019s pretty close! Selena arrived at the LA Vallet Ice Centre in an all-black ensemble, and after cheering on her ex (?!) boo, left the building wearing Beiber\u2019s New Jersey Devils hockey jersey. Isn\u2019t the \u2018borrowed-from-a-boy\u2019 look the international indicator of love?\n\nNovember 2017: Jelena is kissing in public again\n\nGuess it\u2019s not too late to say sorry for #SelenaGomez and #JustinBieber \ud83d\udc95 #Jelena A post shared by FASHION Magazine (@fashioncanada) on Nov 16, 2017 at 9:45am PST\n\n\n\nThis is the PDA confirmation we were waiting for! TMZ has shared photos that show the pop singers sealing the deal with a rink-side kiss at one of Justin\u2019s hockey games. To all those who doubted Jelena: we told you so.\n\nNovember 2017: Justin likes then unlikes a pic of Selena on Instagram\n\n\ud83d\udcf1| Justin Bieber liked this photo of Selena on Instagram pic.twitter.com/gvo1ZnDKr4 \u2014 Selena Gomez Source (@GomezSource) November 20, 2017\n\nJustin Bieber unliked https://t.co/vJbNYlFKRz \u2014 Selena Gomez Source (@GomezSource) November 20, 2017\n\nTrouble in paradise already? Fans freaked out after they noticed Bieber liked a photo of Selena on Instagram, only to unlike it a few minutes later (\u201cTheir whole relationship in a nutshell,\u201d remarked one clever Twitter user). Granted, the photo wasn\u2019t actually posted on Gomez\u2019s account but rather a fan account meaning Biebs (who currently doesn\u2019t follow Selena, nor does she follow him) is resorting to exploring the \u2018gram for pics of his lady.\n\nIn other news, the \u201cWolves\u201d songstress quietly unfollowed ex-boyfriend The Weeknd on Instagram, and he later followed suit. And now we wait for the real indicator of the relationship status of Jelena: the duo hitting the \u201cFollow\u201d button on each others\u2019 accounts. Stay tuned.\n\nDecember 2017: Justin is asked if he\u2019ll propose to Selena\n\nJustin Bieber Smiles, Blushes When Asked If He'll Propose to Selena Gomez https://t.co/ad4u4sGJ3f \u2014 TMZ (@TMZ) December 6, 2017\n\nIn a video captured by TMZ , a paparazzi is heard asking Justin if he plans to get down on one knee to propose to Selena. The Biebs didn\u2019t get a straight answer, but he did flash a wide grin and blush at the question as he got into his car. That\u2019s something, right?\n\nDecember 2017: Justin and Selena will spend Christmas apart\n\nAccording to a recent report from People, Gomez\u2019s family is less than supportive about her reunion with Bieber, and won\u2019t be inviting him their family Christmas. \u201cJustin\u2019s family always loved Selena,\u201d a source told the Magazine, \u201cbut Selena\u2019s family is still not happy about her seeing Justin.\u201d Selena, on the other hand, will always be welcome in Stratford, Ontario: \u201cI\u2019ve met her and we have a special bond, so I think she\u2019s precious,\u201d Beiber\u2019s mom, Pattie Mallete, gushed to People over the weekend.\n\nDecember 2017: Biebs and Selena share a drink at the Sugar Factory\n\nThey may not be spending *actual* Christmas together, but Justin and Selena are making sure to enjoy each other\u2019s company pre-holiday festivities. According to TMZ, Jelena went on a date at the Sugar Factory, sharing a (non-alcoholic) drink called the Ocean Blue.

According to a source, Selena revealed to her mom that the on-again-off-again pair were in couples therapy, leading her to realize \u201cthe relationship was going to be more long-term.\u201d The two later unfollowed each other on Instagram.\n\nDecember 2017: Jelena reportedly in couples therapy because of a fight over Hailey Baldwin\n\nA post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on Jan 3, 2016 at 4:12pm PST\n\nThe drama continues! TMZ reports Jelena is in Christian\u2019s couples therapy after the pair had a fight over Justin\u2019s ex, Hailey Baldwin. According to sources connected to Hillsong Church, Bieber has been trying to make amends with Baldwin to \u201cclear the air over their brief relationship and sour breakup.\u201d He informed Selena of the the convo, which didn\u2019t go over too well, resulting in the pair going to therapy.\n\nJanuary 2018: Justin poses on Instagram with a tree\n\nNow I know what Love is A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on Jan 16, 2018 at 7:45pm PST\n\nTrouble in paradise? While vacationing somewhere tropical, Justin posted a photo cuddling up to a palm tree with the caption, \u201cNow I know what Love is.\u201d Fans panicked: What does this mean? Did he not know what love was like when he was with Selena? Does he love the tree more than Selena? J-14 is convinced the caption is about his love for Jesus. (Interesting.)\n\nFebruary 2018: Jelena spotted making out amidst break-up rumours\n\njust seen Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez cuddling in the middle of the street:))) \u2014 Hennessy \u2728 (@hennessyysilvaa) February 9, 2018\n\nPhew!

But don\u2019t fret Jelena stans! Because from the looks of things, Gomez and Bieber enjoyed a romantic staycation on the West Coast this past weekend in celebration of the holiday. TMZ reports that the duo were hanging poolside at the Montage hotel in Laguna Beach on Sunday, where they were spotted taking romantic beach walks and taking in the view.\n\nFebruary 2018: Jelena heads to Jamaica for a family wedding\n\nBieber and Gomez have landed in the Caribbean for a wedding \u2014 but don\u2019t freak out yet, because it\u2019s not their own. Justin\u2019s dad Jeremy is tying the knot in Jamaica with longtime girlfriend Chelsey Rebelo, and the \u201cSorry\u201d singer is bringing along Selena as his plus one. It\u2019s a pretty big relationship step to take someone as a date to your parent\u2019s destination wedding, right? These two are just as serious as we thought.\n\nMarch 2018: Selena Gomez posts a b-day tribute to her boo\n\nThis is the moment we\u2019ve been waiting for! It\u2019s not the PDA-filled couple selfie we were hoping for, but at least it\u2019s something! It\u2019s sweet, subtle \u2014 and kind of meta? It\u2019s a photo of a photo of Selena Gomez with a photo of Justin Bieber on her forehead. The caption: \u201cMarch 1, 1994 someone I know that happens to be super cool was born. Boom.\u201d Well said.

Bieber has another approach to heartbreak: hang out with a beautiful blonde Sport\u2019s Illustrated model. According to Entertainment Tonight, the mystery girl is Baskin Champion, younger sister to Abby Champion, actor Patrick Schwarzenegger\u2019s GF. Champion and Bieber attended Craig David\u2019s concert together in Los Angeles Tuesday night, where sources say Bieber had his \u201carm wrapped around her waist during one song, and she was spotted dancing up on him throughout the show.\u201d\n\nMarch 2018: Justin and Selena have reportedly called it quits \u2014 for good\n\nGrab your tissue box: it looks like Jelena\u2019s \u201cbreak\u201d has turned into a break-up. Reports say that Bieber is holding out for a reunion, but \u201cSelena realized even though he\u2019s made some positive improvements, they just aren\u2019t a perfect match right now,\u201d a source told E! News. The bad news gets worse, because the source also said that the two aren\u2019t talking anymore (cue the Charlie Puth x Selena Gomez song.)\n\nFans think Gomez\u2019s latest outfit \u2014 a pair of itty-bitty Daisy Dukes and a yellow t-shirt that read, \u201cNever underestimate the power of a woman\u201d \u2014 is hinting at the heartbreak. But hey, this could very well be message for all men!\n\nApril 2018: Sources say Justin wants Selena back\n\nNot all hope is lost! According to a new report from People, Bieber desperately wants Gomez to take him back.\u201cHe loves her. He wants her back,\u201d the source says, adding he \u201cmisses\u201d Gomez. Can these two please just let us know what\u2019s up? This seven year on-again-off-again drama is giving us serious whiplash.\n\nMay 2018: Selena has apparently \u201ccompletely moved on\u201d\n\nHave we reached the end of our lover\u2019s saga? Multiple sources have told E!

Selena rarely even talks about Justin anymore, and is fully open to dating.\u201d So, is this the conclusion of the on-again-off-again romance? Or has precedent shown us that this is just another bump in the road for these star crossed lovers?\n\nJune 2018: Justin and Hailey Baldwin are hanging out again\n\nAhhh another rekindled love! This past weekend, the once rumoured couple reunited for a few days of bikinis and bibles in Miami. They were photographed drying each other off by the pool, attending a church conference and snuggling on the VIP balcony of LIV Nightclub at Fontainebleau. You know, normal relationship stuff.\n\nJuly 2018: Justin and Hailey get engaged\n\nAfter just a month of dating, Bieber popped the big question to Baldwin at a resort in the Bahamas.\u201cEveryone was at a restaurant on the property doing salsa dancing when Justin\u2019s security told everyone to put their phones away,\u201d two witnesses told TMZ, who broke the story early July 8, \u201cbecause something special was about to happen.\u201d\n\nHave we finally reached the fateful end of our ongoing Jelena timeline?

And over here at The Daily Dish, that means looking back on all of the Real Housewives we've had the pleasure of meeting and getting to know this year.\n\nSince March 21, 2006 when The Real Housewives of Orange County originally premiered, more than 100 women have been given the prestigious title of Real Housewife. In 2018 alone, we met nine new Housewives, with five out of the seven franchises welcoming new additions this year.\n\nLook back on all of the lovely ladies we met this year, and we guarantee you'll fall in love with them all over again.\n\nTeddi Mellencamp Arroyave\n\nThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills What Does John Mellencamp Think of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills? Find out the advice he gave his daughter, Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave, on life in the spotlight after she joined the RHOBH cast.\n\nSo technically we met Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave at the end of 2017 upon the Season 8 premiere of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, and we're admitting that because we know the accountability coach would call us out on it if we didn't. But we just couldn't resist including the mom of two.\n\nCandiace Dillard\n\nThe Real Housewives of Potomac Check In With Candiace Dillard Moments Before She Walks Down the Aisle Watch her burst into tears as she prepares to marry her husband Chris Bassett.\n\nThis year brought a whole lot of new to Candiace Dillard's life. Not only did she become the newest member of The Real Housewives of Potomac in Season 3, but she also wed fianc\u00e9 Chris Bassett in a grand ceremony in Washington, D.C. on August 11. We can't wait to see what 2019 brings for Candiace!\n\nDenise Richards\n\nThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills Denise Richards Is Married! Get a peek at the new Beverly Hills Housewife in her wedding dress, and meet her new husband.\n\nSeason 9 of RHOBH may still be on its way, but it was confirmed back in August that Denise Richards would be joining the 90210 squad in the new season. \u201cI am so excited to join the cast of [RHOBH] as I am a huge fan of the show,\" Denise told PEOPLE at the time of her announcement. \u201cI am looking forward to spending time with all the ladies\u2026 and hopefully meeting Boy George!!\u201d\n\nWe're looking forward to spending time with you too, Denise!\n\nEmily Simpson\n\nThe Real Housewives of Orange County Tamra Judge and Emily Simpson Haven't Always Been Friends A former Real Housewife once came between Tamra and Emily, but now the two are patching things up.\n\nEmily Simpson certainly made a splash in her inaugural season of RHOC in Season 13, finding herself at odds with the likes of Shannon Beador and Kelly Dodd. However, Emily's husband, Shane Simpson, also memorably found himself in some major Real Housewives drama at Eddie Judge's birthday party. He's also been a bit of a buzzy figure among RHOC fans. But overall, Emily's RHOC debut has been an inspiring one as she opened up about painful parts of her past and promoted body positivity.\n\nGina Kirschenheiter\n\nThe Real Housewives of Orange County Did Emily Simpson and Gina Kirschenheiter Watch RHOC Before Coming On? Plus, Kelly Dodd reveals what it's like to date as a Real Housewife.\n\nSome women come into The Real Housewives a little more on the timid side in their first season. Gina Kirschenheiter is not one of those women. The Long Island native wasn't afraid to speak her mind when she joined RHOC in Season 13, whether it was standing up to Vicki Gunvalson or getting involved in Shannon and Tamra Judge's friendship drama.

{"label": true, "txt": "If you see any funny business with the envelopes at this year\u2019s Oscars, it\u2019ll be exactly that: funny business, a joke worked up by host Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s team to poke fun at the fiasco that ended last year\u2019s ceremony.\n\nThat\u2019s because the chance that a presenter will receive the wrong envelope and announce the wrong winner this year is about the same as the chance that \u201cThe Boss Baby\u201d will beat \u201cCoco\u201d for Best Animated Feature. Which is to say, it won\u2019t happen.\n\nPwC, the Academy\u2019s accounting firm through about 80 years and a few name changes, had a catastrophic failure last year \u2014 but with new people in charge, new procedures in place and everybody on high alert, it\u2019s inconceivable that we\u2019ll see a repeat of last year unless it\u2019s engineered by Kimmel and crew.\n\nAlso Read: Oscars Stage Manager Details PwC Accountants' Incompetence: 'They Froze' (Exclusive)\n\nAnd make no mistake \u2014 even if the Academy and PwC didn\u2019t do anything, they could still be almost certain that it wouldn\u2019t happen again. It took a perfect storm of ineptitude to produce last year\u2019s fiasco, starting with a money-saving envelope redesign that made the category name harder to read, particularly in the dark. The mistakes went on to include a pair of presenters in their \u201970s, one of them (Warren Beatty) known for fooling around and the other (Faye Dunaway) perpetually surrounded by a certain level of chaos; a spot at the end of the show, when the wings fill up with people and things get more disorganized; a distracted and star-struck accountant (Brian Cullinan) who had been violating the rules by tweeting from backstage during the show, and who was reluctant to acknowledge that he\u2019d given Beatty the wrong envelope and correct his error when it happened; and a second accountant (Martha Ruiz) equally reluctant to do her job, which was to immediately stop the show if an incorrect winner was announced.\n\nCullinan bears the brunt of the responsibility, but the damage would have been less if he had more legible envelopes, a less chaotic backstage environment, presenters who could have figured out the problem before announcing an incorrect winner, and a partner who reacted more quickly.\n\nPwC\u2019s first move after last year\u2019s show was to apologize profusely, and its second was to guarantee that neither Cullinan nor Ruiz would ever again work an Oscars show. (They both remain gainfully employed by the company.)\n\nThey also announced a few steps to prevent a recurrence last March, and then detailed additional steps to the AP in January.\n\nAlso Read: Academy Lets PwC Keep Its Job Despite Oscars Fiasco - But With Big Changes\n\nFor starters, the team that\u2019ll replace Cullinan and Ruiz crucially includes PwC partner Rick Rosas, who served as a balloting leader of the Oscar team for 14 years (the last of those paired with Cullinan) before he relinquished his post to Ruiz in 2015. While Cullinan was known to throw an Oscar party the night before the big show, Rosas would just as soon finish counting and go play golf \u2014 because on the golf course, he once told me, \u201cnobody is around to ask me anything.\u201d\n\n(He also admitted that he \u201cgets a perverse thrill\u201d out of looking at people\u2019s predictions on Oscar morning, when only he and his partners know all the winners.)\n\nRosas\u2019 partner in the wings of the stage will be Kimberly Bourdon, a partner in PwC\u2019s Banking and Capital Markets Industry Audit Practice who has been with the firm for more than 20 years. And a third balloting leader will be stationed in the control trailer behind the Dolby Theatre with the show\u2019s director and producer: Mark Lobel, a PwC principal in the company\u2019s cyber security and privacy practice, who has worked on the Oscars detail for more than five years.\n\nAll three will have the winners memorized \u2013 and Lobel in particular will be in position to immediately notify the production team if a mistake has occurred, something that didn\u2019t happen last year.\n\nPwC\u2019s chairman and senior partner, Tim Ryan, will also attend the show and oversee the process.\n\nAlso Read: See the Backstage Oscar Photo PwC Man Tweeted Just Before Handing Out Wrong Envelope (Photo)\n\nAnd while the new team members don\u2019t sound like star-struck types \u2014 I can vouch that Rosas isn\u2019t, and I suspect that the other two wouldn\u2019t have gotten the gig if they had any Cullinan-esque tendencies \u2014 they\u2019ll also be working under a new rule designed to eliminate distractions: no electronic devices backstage.\n\nAnother new rule says the team must attend rehearsals, which isn\u2019t unusual; once the counting is done, the PwC reps typically show up at Oscar rehearsals on Saturday to check with the production team about which presenters will be entering from stage left and which from stage right. (One accountant is stationed on each side of the stage with a complete set of envelopes, so a logistical rundown tells them who is going to be giving out the envelopes to whom.)\n\nThis year, though, their rehearsal duties will also include participating in a rehearsal of how they\u2019ll handle \u201cpossible onstage issues.\u201d\n\nDuring the show, another new rule says that when the PwC rep hands an envelope to a presenter, both the presenter and the stage manager stationed on that side of the stage must confirm that it is for the correct category. Dency Nelson, a longtime Oscar stage manager who retired five years ago, routinely did this \u2013 but now it\u2019s a hard-and-fast rule.\n\nTwo other factors are as yet unknown: Whether this year\u2019s envelopes will be more readable than last year\u2019s gold-on-red design, and who\u2019ll be presenting the Best Picture award.\n\nThe Academy did not respond to TheWrap\u2019s question about whether a new envelope design would be in place this year, and show producers Michael De Luca and Jennifer Todd are unlikely to spill the beans about the final presenters ahead of time."}
{"label": true, "txt": "Former pop singer Melissa Schuman says she's forgiven Nick Carter weeks after going public with allegations that the Backstreet Boys star raped her.\n\nSchuman recently sat down for an episode of The Dr. Oz Show -- which will air on Friday -- where she shared a message for Carter and explained what motivated her to come forward with her allegations in the first place.\n\n\"I forgive you,\" Schuman, 33, said, directing her remarks toward Carter. \"I don\u2019t want anything from you. I wish you only the best. I don\u2019t want your money. I didn\u2019t do this to hurt you or your family. I did this for me, because I needed this healing.\"\n\n\"I also came forward because I want to inspire other victims, other people who have been assaulted to come forward and know that they have a voice,\" she added in this sneak peek at the upcoming episode.\n\nSchuman -- who was a member of the early 2000s girl group Dream -- came forward with allegations in a post on her personal blog earlier this month, in which she claimed that Carter raped her when she was 18 years old and he was 22.\n\nAfter the post was picked up by media outlets, Carter denied the allegations.\n\n\"I am shocked and saddened by Ms. Schuman\u2019s accusations. Melissa never expressed to me while we were together or at any time since that anything we did was not consensual,\" Carter said in a statement released to ET. \"We went on to record a song and perform together, and I was always respectful and supportive of Melissa both personally and professionally. This is the first that I am hearing about these accusations, nearly two decades later. It is contrary to my nature and everything I hold dear to intentionally cause someone discomfort or harm.\"\n\nWhile speaking with Dr. Oz, Schuman claimed that she originally considered pressing charges against the popular boy band member, but was allegedly warned about the ramifications of coming forward.\n\n\"I\u2019d actually confided in my manager at that time about pressing charges. And I was told that he had the most powerful litigator in the country and that I didn\u2019t have the money to pay for an attorney to essentially defend me, if he were to come after me,\" she said.\n\nThe former singer further claimed that her manager told her, \"'Everyone\u2019s going to call you fame hungry, [and say] that you're trying to use this to better yourself or get your name out there and at this point there\u2019s nothing we can do.\"\n\nSchuman said in the post that she was invited over to Carter's house during a day off from filming a made-for-TV movie they were co-starring in -- 2004's The Hallow. She claimed that after arriving at his apartment with her roommate, they listened to the singer's new music before he allegedly brought her into the bathroom, where she claimed they started kissing.\n\nSchuman alleged that Carter started unbuttoning her pants, disregarding her objections before allegedly performing oral sex on her. She claimed he then demanded she perform oral sex on him, writing, \"My thought was the only way to get out was to get him to finish what he had started.\"\n\nSchuman stated that Carter then took her to the bedroom, where she alleges he raped her.\n\nShe further wrote that she didn't tell anyone about the alleged encounter for years, and even sang a duet with Carter before losing interest in a career as a recording artist.\n\n\"I feel I have an obligation now to come forward with the hope and intention to inspire and encourage other victims to tell their story. We are stronger in numbers,\" Schuman concluded her post.\n\nSchuman's sit-down interview on The Dr. Oz Show airs Friday. Check here for local listings.\n\nCarter is one of dozens of high-profile celebrities who have been accused of sexual misconduct in the past two months.

Cullinan, is set in an isolated Southern boarding school for girls during the Civil War. When a wounded Union soldier found nearby and treated at the seminary, his stay results in seduction, envy and betrayal.\n\nThe film boasts a star-studded cast: Nicole Kidman is headmistress Martha Farnsworth, Colin Farrell plays the soldier, Kirsten Dunst portrays a teacher named Edwina and Elle Fanning is her rival, a student named Alicia.\n\nThe Beguiled is actually a remake of a 1971 film of the same name, which starred Clint Eastwood in Farrell's role. Although the original movie revolved around the soldier, Coppola's edition puts the focus on the women, and their complex dynamic within their secluded setting.\n\n\"The main crux of the story is about the dynamics between a group of women all stuck together, and then also the power shifts between men and women,\" Coppola told Entertainment Weekly. \"So for me, it's very universal, but it's in this exotic setting of the Southern gentility.\"\n\nThe Beguiled comes to theaters on June 23.

Diane Lane has revealed she was originally tipped to play the role of Vivian Ward in the film but was forced to turn it down due to \"conflicting schedules\". During an appearance on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, the 52-year-old confessed the role was highly popular and that \"every actress in town\" auditioned for it.\n\n\"Everybody in town went for that role. At that time - as I've said on other shows \u2013 it's true, it was a very different [film],\" she explained. \"It kind of got Disney-fied and it turned out to be a feel good movie. Originally, this crazy [woman] was kicked out of a rolling limo in the end because she was delusional that she thought this guy was in love with her. She was only hired for the weekend. And we had such compassion for her.\" She later teased: \"I think that movie needs to get made. I want to direct it, let's make it happen.\"\n\nThe Hollywood film was originally pitched as a cautionary tale of drug use, but after Disney and director Gary Marshall came on board, the film became more light-hearted. Julia, who played Vivian, had to re-audition and luckily landed the part again before screen-testing with male actors to find her leading man. Other stars such as Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer also went for the lead roles.\n\nGarry, who passed away last year, confessed the movie would of went in a completely different direction if he didn't cast Richard Gere and his leading lady Julia. He told Vanity Fair: \"It would definitely have been a different movie if had it been Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer. It might have been closer to the original script and maybe not have had a happy ending. But the chemistry between Julia and Richard, it is palpable on the screen, it was palpable in auditions.

Trump's tweets also followed days of brutal commentary in the wake of the publication of Michael Wolff's new book, Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House, that quotes staffers as calling the president everything from \"moron\" to \"idiot,\" and describing him as uninformed and \"like a child.\" On Sunday, former White House strategist Steve Bannon said he intended to blame former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, not Trump's son, for a meeting in 2016 with a Russian lawyer that was characterized as \"treasonous\" in Wolff's book.\n\nAstronaut John Young dies at 87\n\nAstronaut John Young, who walked on the moon and was the first to fly into space six times, died Friday night at 87.

He went to the moon in May 1969 aboard Apollo 10 and again in April 1972 on Apollo 16. Young had gone into space as apart of the Gemini, Apollo and space shuttle programs, the only NASA astronaut to be a part of all three.\n\nRemembering John Young (1930-2018) Astronaut John Young aboard Gemini III on March 23, 1965.

He was 86. Van Dyke's wife, Shirley Ann Jones, said his health had deteriorated since a car accident two years ago. Van Dyke got his start in TV by making appearances on The Dick Van Dyke Show, the American sitcom that starred his real-life older brother.

Trump's administration asked Congress on Friday to set aside that amount over the next 10 years to build or extend the nearly 700-mile barrier that became a signature 2016 presidential campaign pledge. The estimate is the most detailed accounting yet of how much it will cost to make the border wall a reality. The proposal comes as the administration intensifies negotiations with Congress on a package to overhaul the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\n\nThe Wall: Untold stories along the U.S.-Mexico border March 19, 2017; Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico; Tutu'uli, a 6-month old female jaguar lives at the Ecological Center of Sonora on March 19, 2017, in Hermosillo, Mexico.

The mountain is in a spot along the U.S.-Mexico border that allows pilgrims to see Mexico, El Paso and New Mexico from different vantage points. It's also a reminder of the church's teachings, which Aguilar said will be threatened if a wall is erected. Pilgrims reach the base of the limestone cross atop Mount Cristo Rey near Sunland Park, N.M., on April 14, 2017 which is Good Friday. In earlier times, pilgrims from both sides of the border would visit the cross. Cars travel along the dirt road leading to the base of Mount Cristo Rey on April 14, 2017, near Sunland Park, N.M.

{"label": true, "txt": "Kendra Wilkinson has issued an apology to ex Hank Baskett for cutting his football career short. The reality TV actress owned up to the things she\u2019s done that caused the latter\u2019s early retirement from the sport.\n\nOn Wednesday, Wilkinson took to Twitter to publicly say sorry to her soon-to-be ex-husband. \u201cI want to apologize publicly to Hank. I was the reason your football career ended. I regret doing that to u and i hope u learn to forgive me one day. I loved u and was always your number one fan (sic),\u201d she wrote in a series of now-deleted tweets, according to ET Online.\n\nWilkinson continued her apology by saying, \u201cI was 24 when i got married.

She previously revealed on the social networking platform that her baby daddy was blaming her for his failed football career. Baskett also allegedly blamed her for the cheating scandal because he only looked for pleasure elsewhere because she was pregnant at the time.\n\nThe exchange did not end well because Wilkinson discovered that Baskett was recording her the entire time. \u201cI\u2019m minding my business and after I tell him to leave me alone he disrespects me.

{"label": true, "txt": "The East Coast\u2013West Coast hip hop rivalry was a feud between artists and fans of the East Coast hip hop and West Coast hip hop scenes in the United States, especially from 1994 to 1997. Focal points of the feud were East Coast\u2013based rapper The Notorious B.I.G. (and his New York\u2013based label, Bad Boy Records), and West Coast\u2013based rapper Tupac Shakur (and his Los Angeles\u2013based label, Death Row Records), who were both murdered in drive-by shootings. Orlando Anderson (a.k.a. Baby Lane) is believed to be the person responsible for the murder of Shakur. The person responsible for the murder of Biggie Smalls (The Notorious B.I.G.) remains unknown.\n\nOrigins of hip hop [ edit ]\n\nHip hop emerged in the 1970s on the streets of South Bronx . Hip Hop was powered by DJs such as Kool Herc, who many consider its founding father, Grandmaster Flash, and Afrika Bambaataa. The new genre became popular throughout the city's neighborhoods. MCs, Graffiti, and Hip Hop were huge cultural influences at this time. The New York City area remained the forefront for rap music throughout the mid-'80s, becoming home to numerous stars such as Run-DMC, A Tribe Called Quest, LL Cool J, KRS-One, Doug E. Fresh, Rakim, Big Daddy Kane, Biz Markie, Slick Rick, The Beastie Boys, Salt-n-Pepa, and others. In the early 1990s hip hop functioned to give the black community a voice in the public sphere,[1] and had spread from New York to across the country in the East Coast as well as worldwide. Hip hop gained appeal among African-Americans because of the \"authentic\" nature of the lyrical content.[2] It transitioned into gangsta rap in the 1990s, which involved rapping about drugs, violence, and sexualizing women.[citation needed]\n\nEmergence of the West Coast [ edit ]\n\nIn 1986, Crenshaw\u2013based Ice T released the song \"6 in the Mornin'.\" It is considered by many critics as the very first gangsta rap song.[citation needed] The LA gangsta rap scene exploded afterwards. This rap style basically represented the life of gangsters day to day.\n\nWith the help of friend Jerry Heller, Eazy-E founded Ruthless Records on March 3, 1986. Shortly afterwards, his group N.W.A released the Panic Zone EP. It contained the title track (Arabian Prince), \"8 Ball\" (Eazy-E), and the well-known \"Dope Man\" (Ice Cube).\n\nThe group's debut album was released later in the year. It featured the Fila Fresh Crew and a young The D.O.C. The most popular song on the release was the famous track \"Boyz-n-the-Hood\". Although the track was written by Ice Cube, Eazy-E handled the vocals. Eazy E began as a solo artist but then joined the group.[3][4][5]\n\nA disagreement over money saw Arabian Prince leave N.W.A just before the release of their ground-breaking Straight Outta Compton. Eazy-E's friend MC Ren filled his place. Backed by hit singles such as \"Straight Outta Compton (song)\", \"Fuck tha Police\" and \"Gangsta Gangsta\", the album redefined the genre and cemented the West Coast's presence in the nation's rap scene.\n\nFinancial issues led to the break up of the group. Eazy-E remained the wealthy owner/manager of his Ruthless label. Ice Cube released a string of successful albums that included AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted and Death Certificate. Dr Dre would go on to co-own Death Row Records with Suge Knight.\n\nAt Death Row, Dr Dre released one of the most influential hip hop albums of all time in The Chronic. It revolutionized the G-Funk movement. Other successful stars on the label included Snoop Doggy Dogg, Tupac Shakur, Warren G, The Lady of Rage, Nate Dogg, Daz Dillinger, and Kurupt of Tha Dogg Pound. By the mid 1990s the West Coast had separated itself as the dominant region in hip hop.\n\nRevival of the East [ edit ]\n\nNew York group The Wu-Tang Clan's 1993 debut album Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) led to a revival of public interest in East Coast hip-hop, due in part to its lo-fi sound quality and its technical and wordy lyricism. Later in April 1994, 20-year-old Queens-based MC Nas released Illmatic, five of whose ten tracks were released as singles and which received a coveted five-mic rating from The Source. The release of these two albums was vital to renewing interest in East Coast hip-hop, facilitating the so-called East Coast Renaissance.\n\nA few months later, the then 22-year-old Notorious B.I.G. released Ready to Die, which was certified gold within two months of release and helped to establish Bad Boy Records as notable. On June 25, 1996, Brooklyn native Jay-Z released his debut album Reasonable Doubt, drawing further attention to the East Coast.\n\nRivalry [ edit ]\n\nTim Dog [ edit ]\n\nIn 1991, angry at record companies' rejections of East Coast artists and the growing popularity of West Coast hip hop, Bronx rapper Tim Dog decided to voice his anger on the notorious diss track \"Fuck Compton\". It contained shots at the entire LA rap scene, particularly the members of NWA. The music video featured violent threats aimed at Eazy-E, Dr Dre and Michel'le look-a-likes, as well as DJ Quik and Ice Cube.\n\nThere were several responses from numerous West Coast artists, including the \"Fuck wit Dre Day (And Everybody's Celebratin')\" which featured Snoop Doggy Dogg dissing Tim Dog (as well as Eazy E and others), and a separate skit, \"$20 Sack Pyramid\". Both featured on Dr Dre's The Chronic album. Compton's Most Wanted responded with \"Who's Fucking Who?\"\n\nBad Boy vs. Death Row [ edit ]\n\nSean \"Puff Daddy\" Combs\n\nIn 1993, fledgling A&R executive and record producer Sean \"Puff Daddy\" Combs founded the New York-centered hip-hop label, Bad Boy Records.[6][7] The next year, the label's debut releases by Brooklyn-based rapper The Notorious B.I.G. (also known as Biggie Smalls; born Christopher Wallace)[8] and Long Island\u2013based rapper Craig Mack became immediate critical and commercial successes, and seemed to revitalize the East Coast hip-hop scene by 1995.[9] New York born and California-based rapper Tupac Shakur publicly accused The Notorious B.I.G., Andre Harrell, and Sean Combs of involvement in his shooting (and robbery) in the lobby of Quad Recording Studios in Manhattan on November 30, 1994.[10][11][12][13][13][14] Shortly after the shooting, \"Who Shot Ya?,\" a B-side track from Biggie's \"Big Poppa\" single was released. Although Combs and Wallace denied having anything to do with the shooting and stated that \"Who Shot Ya?\" had been recorded before the shooting,[15] 2Pac and the majority of the hip hop community interpreted it as B.I.G.'s way of taunting him.[16][17]\n\nIn August 1995, Death Row CEO Suge Knight took a dig at Bad Boy and Combs at that year's Source Awards; announcing to the assembly of artists and industry figures: \"Any artist out there that want to be an artist and stay a star, and don't have to worry about the executive producer trying to be all in the videos ... All on the records ... dancing, come to Death Row!\"[18]\n\nIt was a direct reference to Combs' tendency of ad-libbing on his artists' songs and dancing in their videos.[19] With the ceremony being held in New York, to the audience, Knight's comments seemed a slight to the entire East Coast hip-hop scene, and resulted in boos from the crowd.[20]\n\nProblems continued when Knight later attended a party for producer Jermaine Dupri in Atlanta. During the bash, a close friend of Knight's (Jake Robles) was fatally shot.[21] Knight accused Combs (also in attendance) of having something to do with the shooting.[12][22][23] The same year, Knight posted the $1.4 million bail of the then-incarcerated 2Pac, in exchange for his signing with Death Row Records.[24] Shortly after the rapper's release for five counts of sexual abuse in October 1995, he proceeded to join Knight in furthering Death Row's feud with Bad Boy Records.[25]\n\nTha Dogg Pound's single \"New York, New York\", supported by a music video featuring a gigantic Snoop Dogg destroying various NYC buildings, was interpreted as a direct insult towards New York and the East Coast. Tha Dogg Pound was allegedly even shot at while making the video in New York City.\n\n2Pac vs. The Notorious B.I.G. [ edit ]\n\n\"Who Shot Ya?\"[25] C'mere c'mere ... open your fucking mouth ... Didn't I tell you not to fuck with me? ... Can't talk with a gun in your mouth huh? ... Bitch-ass nigga, what? - The Notorious B.I.G.\n\n\"Hit 'Em Up\" Who shot me? But ya punks didn't finish now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace nigga, I hit 'em up! - 2Pac\n\nAfter the release of \"Who Shot Ya?\", which Shakur interpreted as a diss song mocking his robbery/shooting,[26] 2Pac appeared on numerous tracks aiming threatening or antagonistic insults at Biggie, Bad Boy as a label, and anyone affiliated with them from late 1995 to 1996. Examples include the songs \"Against All Odds\", \"Bomb First (My Second Reply)\" and \"Hit 'Em Up\".[27][28] During this time the media became heavily involved and dubbed the rivalry a coastal rap war, reporting on it continually.[29][30] This caused fans from both scenes to take sides.[9]\n\nAlthough an official retaliation record was never released by the Brooklyn MC in response to Shakur's slurs, a certain number of Biggie's lyrics were interpreted by listeners as subliminal shots aimed at Shakur, in particular the track \"Long Kiss Goodnight\", which Lil' Cease claimed was about 2Pac in an XXL interview. Puffy, however, steadfastly denied this theory, affirming that if Biggie were to diss 2Pac, he would have called him out by name.[31]\n\nOn September 7, 1996, Tupac Shakur was shot in a drive-by shooting at the intersection of Flamingo Road and Koval Lane in Las Vegas, Nevada.[32] He was taken to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, where he died six days later. In 2002, Chuck Phillips wrote the article \"Who Killed Tupac Shakur?\"[33] reporting that, \"the shooting was carried out by a Compton gang called the Southside Crips to avenge the beating of one of its members by Shakur a few hours earlier ... Orlando Anderson, the Crip whom Shakur had attacked, fired the fatal shots. Las Vegas police discounted Anderson as a suspect and interviewed him only once, briefly. He was later killed in an \"unrelated gang shooting\" nearly 2 years later on May 29, 1998. The Phillips article and its follow-up, \"How Vegas Police Probe Floundered in Tupac Shakur Case\"[34] also implicated East Coast rappers including Biggie Smalls.\n\nSix months after Tupac's death, on March 9, 1997, The Notorious B.I.G. was killed in a drive-by shooting by an unknown assailant in Los Angeles, California.\n\nIn 2018, Eminem released the diss track Killshot in which Eminem makes reference to Diddy being responsible for putting \"the hit out that got 'Pac killed.\"\n\nHip-Hop Peace Summits [ edit ]\n\nOn September 22, 1996, a peace summit was convened at Mosque Maryam by Louis Farrakhan in the wake of the murder of Tupac Shakur,[35] and another after the shooting of Biggie Smalls.[36][37] Minister Farrakhan continues these summits, which have been held since the 1980s,[38] where he calls for peace.[39][40][41]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nIt Was Written, a 1996 album by East Coast rapper, Nas, that was produced by West Coast producer Dr. Dre during the period of the rivalry."}
{"label": true, "txt": "\n\nAccording to several White House staff members, first lady Melania Trump has erected a de facto wall between the East Wing, where she is renovating her office and enjoying growing popularity, and the West Wing, where her husband works. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nDonald and Melania Trump\u2019s remarkably separate daily routines begin with him getting up around 5:30 a.m., watching cable news shows and tweeting.\n\nThe first lady wakes in her own bedroom a bit later, according to two close friends of the Trumps. She then readies their 12-year-old son for school, including checking to make sure his homework is in his backpack.\n\nAmid the noise and churn of the Trump administration \u2014 most recently about how the president paid money to silence Stormy Daniels \u2014 Melania Trump has settled into a quieter routine, often apart from the president, raising their son and carving out a place for herself in a most untraditional White House.\n\nThe first lady has not directly addressed the affairs that Daniels and another woman, Karen McDougal, said they had with her husband. But she has noticeably begun to raise her profile, independent from the president\u2019s, and she has called a news conference in the White House Rose Garden on Monday, a public appearance that would have been almost unthinkable just a few months ago.\n\n\u201cHer focus all along has been children, and this launch is meant to formalize what her role will be for the next three to seven years,\u201d said Stephanie Grisham, Melania\u2019s spokeswoman. She said the first lady will devote the rest of the Trump presidency to the issues children face today and their well-being.\n\n[Melania Trump plans to bring attention to the problems children face]\n\nIn recent weeks, the first lady has been at the center of more high-profile events than during the entire previous year \u2014 including attending the funeral of former first lady Barbara Bush solo.\n\nPolitical marriages tend to be more complicated than most, but it\u2019s striking that the Trumps make so little effort to project a more united front. Although both are keenly aware of the power of visual images, some of their memorable moments together are awkward: Melania swatting his hand away on a tarmac, and several times caught on camera seeming to resist his outreach.\n\n\u201cShe is a dignified, private person, and she\u2019ll deal with her personal life in private and it\u2019s no one\u2019s business,\u201d said Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a longtime friend of Melania\u2019s. \u201cThey are not that couple that holds hands just because; she is old-world European and it\u2019s not who she is.\u201d\n\nIt is unusual to see a candid shot of the president enjoying an unplanned moment with his wife, or even with Barron, the first young son in the White House since John F. Kennedy Jr. in the early 1960s.\n\nThe Trumps are often apart even during their free time, according to several people who know the couple\u2019s schedules. At Mar-a-Lago on holidays and weekends, the president golfs or dines with politicians, business executives and media personalities on the patio, while Melania is often nowhere to be seen. According to several current and former aides, the president and first lady often do not eat together in the White House either.\n\n\u201cThey spend very little to no time together,\u201d said one longtime friend of the president.\n\nGrisham said the president and Melania do spend time with each other. \u201cAside from the president\u2019s solo trips, the family spends most evenings together.\u201d She also played down the headlines about Trump\u2019s alleged affairs and said Melania \u201cis focused on being a mom. She\u2019s focused on being a wife, and she\u2019s focused on her role as first lady. And that\u2019s it. The rest is just noise.\u201d\n\nA senior West Wing official, when asked about the couple\u2019s separate schedules and bedrooms, declined to comment, saying it wasn\u2019t official business.\n\nMelania grants few interviews and declined to speak for this article, but during the campaign she told The Washington Post that she and her husband are \u201cvery independent,\u201d adding, \u201cWe give ourselves and each other space.\u201d\n\nAccording to several people who know the couple, that space appears to have grown wider under the White House roof \u2014 especially since Daniels, a porn star whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, as well as Karen McDougal, a Playboy model, publicly talked about their alleged affairs with Trump during his marriage to Melania. Daniels was paid $130,000 during the campaign by a Trump attorney to stop talking about the affair.\n\nLast week, Trump tweeted that he repaid the attorney to \u201cstop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair.\u201d Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump\u2019s lawyers, told NBC News that payment was made \u201cto prevent personal embarrassment and heartache to [Trump\u2019s] wife.\u201d\n\nAnother awkward exchange happened April 26 with Trump calling into \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d announcing that it was Melania\u2019s birthday, and then suddenly talking about Daniels. Asked on the same TV show what he had gotten Melania for her birthday, he paused: \u201cMaybe, I didn\u2019t get her so much. I got her a beautiful card, you know I\u2019m very busy to be running out looking for presents.\u201d\n\nAccording to several White House staff members, Melania has erected a de facto wall between the East Wing, where she is renovating her office and enjoying growing popularity, and the West Wing, where her husband and Ivanka Trump, her eldest stepdaughter, have offices.\n\nWhile she goes to the West Wing for official duties, she does not walk down the hall, pop her head in and see how the president\u2019s day is going.\n\n\u201cShe seldom sets foot in the West Wing,\u201d said one person with firsthand knowledge.\n\nYet, many political analysts believe that Trump will need Melania at his side if he wants to win again in 2020.\n\nThe Trumps have broken the traditional mold of a presidential family from the moment he was sworn in. While Melania stood beside the president at the Capitol, his two ex-wives, Ivana Trump and Marla Maples, sat in the crowd.\n\nTrump is the only president to be married three times. Melania is 48, and the president is 71.\n\nRather than move into the White House with her husband, Melania stayed in New York for six months to allow Barron to finish his school year there. That delay initially put Melania at a disadvantage, according to a friend who said the rhythm of the White House had already been established, and left her out of the mix. Some staff positions from the first lady\u2019s office were diverted to the West Wing \u2014 including to support Ivanka, who is a presidential adviser, according to a person close to the first lady.\n\n\n\nMelania Trump and Barron participate in the presentation of the White House Christmas tree. She delayed her move to the White House by six months so that he could finish out the school year in New York. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nDonald Trump and Barron board Air Force One. It is rare to see a candid shot of the president enjoying an unplanned moment with his wife, or even with Barron, the first young son in the White House since John F. Kennedy Jr. in the early 1960s. (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nIvanka, 36, and Melania, both former models, do not have a close relationship and are very different from one another, several people who know them both said. Grisham said it was not only wrong to say Melania was not close to her stepdaughter but \u201churtful.\u201d\n\nNoticeably, Melania\u2019s presence is growing as Ivanka\u2019s fades.\n\nLast year, an official White House statement described Ivanka as holding an \u201cunprecedented role for a first daughter\u201d and she has at times taken on the duties of a first lady. Ivanka acts as the president\u2019s policy adviser, has traveled the globe as her father\u2019s surrogate, and sat down with world leaders at the White House. But recently her public profile has been reduced.\n\nFirst ladies often have had considerable influence, as an informal adviser to the president and the person closest to him. They have been the hidden hand in policy decisions and hiring and firings. And, they can command attention for causes. Most recently, Laura Bush established the National Book Festival and used her foreign trips to focus concern on HIV/AIDS, and Michelle Obama promoted girls\u2019 education globally and started a movement here to get children exercising and eating healthier.\n\nMelania\u2019s staff is unusually small; with 10 people, it is about half the size of Michelle Obama\u2019s at its peak.\n\nMelania has borrowed books from the White House Historical Association to study the first lady\u2019s role and plans to outline on Monday a new initiative concerning children.\n\nSeveral polls have shown that as she becomes more visible, her popularity is rising. In many ways the image she projects is the least like Trump\u2019s of all the Trumps.\n\nThe president organizes big rallies; Melania often holds meetings with just a few people. Her husband rails against family-based \u201cchain migration\u201d; she is from Slovenia and now her parents, also immigrants, have become legal residents here, too.\n\nThe president mocks political enemies on Twitter with his derogatory nicknames such as \u201cCryin\u2019 Charles E. Schumer\u201d or \u201cCheatin\u2019 Obama\u201d; Melania calls cyberbullying an \u201cevil\u201d and organized a White House conference to try to stop it.\n\nMelania has complained that she doesn\u2019t deserve the mean comments she has read about herself online. She has been heard saying that she knows her husband has contributed to the combative nature of today\u2019s online chatter, and one associate said she has persisted with her anti-cyberbullying efforts despite White House advice that she pick any other issue to champion.\n\n\n\nMelania Trump, who has said she plans to focus on issues affecting children during her time as first lady, visited a youth program at Andrews Air Force Base last year. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nIn March, Melania invited top executives from Twitter, Facebook and other tech companies, along with nonprofits working on Internet safety, to the White House to hold a meeting on the issue.\n\n\u201cI am well aware that people are skeptical of me discussing this topic,\u201d she told the group. \u201cI have been criticized for my commitment to tackling this issue, and I know that will continue. But it will not stop me for doing what I know is right,\u201d she said in opening remarks. \u201cWe have to find a better way to talk to each other, to disagree with each other, to respect each other.\u201d\n\nStephen Balkam, the founder and CEO of the Family Online Safety Institute, was seated at a table with the first lady. \u201cIt was a pretty remarkable opening,\u201d he said. \u201cI was pleased that she addressed the elephant in the room.\u201d\n\nMelania has not always been willing to go in a different direction from her husband. In 2011, when Trump was one of the leading \"birthers\" challenging the validity of President Obama's birth certificate and U.S. citizenship, Melania backed him up.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this with the birth certificate obsession? Did he ask to see yours when you met him?\u201d asked TV interviewer Joy Behar.\n\n\u201cDo you want to see President Obama\u2019s birth certificate or not?\u201d Melania responded. She also said what Obama had made public to date was \u201cdifferent\u201d from a birth certificate. \u201cIt would be very easy if President Obama would just show it,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt is not only Donald who wants to see it. It\u2019s the American people . . . they want to see that.\u201d\n\nBut as first lady, she has publicly praised Michelle Obama and laughed alongside President Obama, who sat beside her at Barbara Bush\u2019s funeral last month in Houston. She also shared the pew with Bill and Hillary Clinton \u2014 two favorite targets of her husband\u2019s criticism.\n\nMelania received a warm reception from the former presidents and first ladies. Photos of them all together \u2014 the Obamas, the Clintons, George W. Bush, Laura Bush and George H.W. Bush \u2014 show Melania beaming.\n\n\n\nFormer presidents and former first ladies Laura Bush, George W.

Phillip/AP)\n\nShe has also traveled apart from her husband \u2014 even when they are going to the same destination. In February, hours after the New Yorker published a story about Trump\u2019s alleged affair with McDougal, the Playboy model, Melania did not walk with Trump across the White House\u2019s South Lawn to board Marine One.\n\nBoth Trumps were heading to Mar-a-Lago for the weekend, but instead of making the very public walk across the White House lawn with her husband to the helicopter, she drove separately to the Maryland military airport to catch Air Force One. Grisham told reporters at the time that given the first lady\u2019s schedule, it was just easier for the couple to meet at the plane. When her motorcade pulled up, White House press aides shouted at journalists to get off the plane until she boarded. No photos were allowed of her arrival.\n\nAs first ladies often are, Melania is more popular than her husband. But two friends of the couple say the president, who pays close attention to his poll numbers, also fixates on hers. Her approval rating was 47 percent to his 40 percent in a January CNN poll.\n\nGrisham said Melania takes her role seriously and is careful to coordinate with Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary. \u201cBasically, we\u2019re like, \u2018Okay, we\u2019ll put this out,\u2019 or, \u2018We\u2019ll wait for you.\u2019 . . . We don\u2019t want to conflict with the president\u2019s message of the day, nor do we want him to do that to us.\u201d\n\nBut, she added, \u201cthe 24/7 social media-cable news cycle and a West Wing that\u2019s very active . . . perhaps overshadows some of the good work she\u2019s doing.\u201d\n\nTrump described Melania to supporters in a recent email as his \u201crock and foundation.\u201d \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be the man I am today without her by my side,\u201d he said. \u201cMy BEAUTIFUL, kindhearted and exceptional wife.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey have an unspoken affinity,\u201d said Winston Wolkoff, whose official advisory arrangement in the first lady\u2019s office ended earlier this year amid headlines about inauguration spending and the White House\u2019s move to end informal contracts.\n\nAnother person close to the president said they had heard him call Melania when he travels and \u201cshe is someone he relies on and listens to.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are not that couple that holds hands just because; she is old-world European and it\u2019s not who she is. . . . They have an unspoken affinity. They have fun together. He relies on her and he trusts her,\u201d said Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a longtime friend of Melania\u2019s. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nMelania has said she sometimes offers advice to her husband \u2014 including about his tweets \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean he takes it.\n\nDuring one dinner in the White House in late 2017, Melania told the president that he should be more concerned about the investigation led by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and that his legal team wasn\u2019t protecting him, according to a person who attended the dinner. Trump disagreed, this person said, insisting that the investigation was going to exonerate him and that he had great lawyers. Grisham disputed this account, saying: \u201cYour anonymous sources are wrong.\u201d Since that dinner, two of three lawyers have left Trump\u2019s Russia team.\n\nSeveral people in the White House, who like others interviewed for this story did not want to be quoted by name discussing the first couple\u2019s relationship, said Melania does not trust some members of her husband\u2019s staff. Two people in a position to know said she particularly disliked former chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and told her husband so, and she was upset about the abrupt dismissal of John McEntee, Trump\u2019s young personal assistant. He left over a security clearance issue but is now working on Trump\u2019s reelection effort.\n\nTrump insisted on a prenuptial agreement when he married Melania 13 years ago, just as he had with his two previous wives. The terms have never been made public. A person close to Melania noted that the prenuptial was signed before his political career, which forced her to take on a whole new role and one, as a friend said, that is \u201cunpaid.\u201d\n\n\"Free Melania!\" continues to be a popular meme. Late-night TV comedy skits portray her as trapped inside the White House, unhappy.\n\nFor months, a persistent rumor has floated around Washington that Melania doesn\u2019t really live in the White House and stays in a house with her parents and Barron near his suburban Washington school.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 1,000 percent false. We laugh at it all the time,\u201d Grisham said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an urban legend,\u201d said Rickie Niceta Lloyd, the White House social secretary.\n\nMelania is exceedingly close to her parents and her son, Barron, who also speaks Slovenian with his grandparents. When she is out of the public eye, she is often with her family, friends say.\n\nHer office declined to say where her parents live, or even whether they keep a room at the White House, as Michelle Obama\u2019s mother did.\n\n[Melania Trump\u2019s parents are legal permanent residents, raising questions about whether they relied on \u2018chain migration\u2019]\n\nMelania does spend a lot of time in the White House, according to people who work there, and has a very good relationship with the permanent household staff of nearly 100 that includes chefs, florists and butlers, and she oversees the residence as well as the state floor.\n\nFriends say she is a perfectionist who oversees the tiniest details of events in which she is involved.\n\nShe enjoys putting her personal mark on the historic home and has redesigned the family living quarters. While her husband favors the lavish gold-and-glitz decor of their Trump Tower penthouse, Melania has picked neutral colors.\n\n\u201cIt is a very comfortable and calming place to be in,\u201d Winston Wolkoff said.\n\nStill, Trump often waves friends up to the residence after holiday parties or social gatherings and gives tours of the Lincoln Bedroom, where he remarks on how tall the former president was while showing off the Gettysburg Address and other features of the home. Melania has, however, told confidantes she wants to keep the residence private.\n\nAlthough English is not her first language, she is getting more used to public speaking. She has also begun releasing videos of her work.\n\nThe latest highly produced video shows her preparing for the recent state dinner for French President Emmanuel Macron and has been viewed by nearly 1.5 million people.\n\nTwenty-two years after first coming to the United States to model, she is now one of the most-photographed women in the world.\n\nPaolo Zampolli, who helped arrange for Melania to work in the U.S. fashion industry and sees her in the White House, said Melania is blossoming.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible story. It\u2019s the American Dream,\u201d said Zampolli. \u201cShe really will become the queen of people\u2019s hearts, like Princess Diana was. I think the world will be seeing more of her.\u201d"}
{"label": true, "txt": "About Jim Bob and Michelle\n\nJim Bob & Michelle Duggar married July 21st, 1984. At that time, they chose to use the birth control pill. They thought, \u201cWe don\u2019t want children right now. We can\u2019t afford them. We want children in our timing, when we\u2019re ready.\u201d Four years later they decided to have their first child. Then, Michelle went back on the pill, but she conceived and had a miscarriage. At that point they talked with a Christian medical doctor and read the fine print in the contraceptives package. They found that while taking the pill you can get pregnant and then miscarry. They were grieved! They were Christians! They were pro-life! They realized that their selfish actions had taken the life of their child.\n\nThey prayed and asked God to forgive them, and to teach them to love children like He loves children. They asked God to bless them with as many children as He saw fit in His timing. Right after that Michelle got pregnant with twins! To date they have been blessed with 19 children, (10 boys and 9 girls) Joshua (& wife Anna), Jana & John-David (twins), Jill, Jessa, Jinger, Joseph, Josiah, Joy-Anna, Jedidiah & Jeremiah (twins), Jason, James, Justin, Jackson, Johannah, Jennifer, Jordyn-Grace and Josie.\n\nGod has opened many doors for them to share that children are a blessing from the Lord!

{"label": true, "txt": "Ashlee Simpson Net Worth: Ashlee Simpson is an American singer-songwriter and actress who has a net worth of $11 million. Since first popping onto the music scene, Ashlee Simpson has released three studio albums in her career. Her first album, \"Autobiography\" was a hit, as was its reality show counterpart that was called simply, \"The Ashley Simpson Show\". Her fame was tarnished somewhat after a poorly lip-synched performance on a 2004 episode of \"Saturday Night Live\". She was born Ashlee Nicole Simpson on October 3, 1984, in Waco, Texas. Ashlee is younger sister of superstar Jessica Simpson. Ashlee first became notable as a participant in her sister's reality show Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica. She then became the star of her own spin-off program The Ashlee Simpson Show, which documented the creation of her debut album, Autobiography. Having fallen in love in music at an early age, 11-year-old Ashlee was the youngest child ever to be admitted in the School of American Ballet. By the time she turned 14, she moved with her parents and older sister to Los Angeles where she was already dancing in Jessica's stage show. While her performances on Malcolm in the Middle and The View earned her a regular role on the television show Seventh Heaven. However, Ashlee's heart was set on a music career. She finally saw the leak of one of her songs, \"Just Let Me Cry\", as it landed on the Freaky Friday soundtrack in 2003. Since then, Ashlee has continued to work on her rocking and punky demos, a different musical style from Jessica's. Ashlee's debut album eventually came to light in 2004, when MTV was debuting Ashlee's own reality show. In the first week, the album went to #1 on the Billboard album charts with sales of 398,000 copies. Her second effort, I Am Me, was released in October 2005. As part of her tour to support the album, Simpson also appeared as Roxie Hart in the London production of Chicago. In 2008 Ashlee Simpson married Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz. The same year her third album, Bittersweet World, was released featuring hit singles like \"Outta My Head (Ay Ya Ya)\" and \"Little Miss Obsessive. Simpson and Wentz divorced in 2011. In 2014, Ashlee married Diana Ross' son Evan Ross."}

The couple had long planned to adopt the children and were waiting for an official court date when one was finally confirmed in April, just as the family left for a trip to Orlando, Florida, to visit the Magic Kingdom.\n\nWhen the family checked into the park, they were handed buttons to write down what they were there to celebrate. Courtney wrote \u201cadopting our kids\u201d on her and Tom\u2019s buttons, took a picture of it, and tweeted it the Walt Disney World Twitter account. A Disney representative contacted Courtney a short time later asking how they could make their stay a little extra special. \u201cI thought that they were going to give us free dessert!\u201d Courtney tells PEOPLE.\n\nInstead, the park had something much bigger in mind, and it involved their most famous star.\n\nA video posted by Courtney on July 6 shows the family attending a surprise meet and greet with Mickey at the back of the Town Street Theater at Disney World. \u201cThe kids have never been there before, so it didn\u2019t set off any flags that something was happening, we didn\u2019t make it a big deal,\u201d Courtney says.\n\nThe footage shows Mickey signing Janielle and Elijah\u2019s guestbook and performing a card trick before a sign is brought out to the kids with a date written across it: May 24, 2017, the day they would officially be adopted. Upon seeing it, both children burst into tears.\n\nFinally, the long wait was over.\n\nThe May 24 adoption ceremony at a local courthouse was filled with friends and family. Courtney says that the day was especially important for Janielle, who has been her brother\u2019s protector for all their lives. \u201cWhen the adoption happened, you saw all of that roll off of her,\u201d she says. \u201cShe knew she did not have to have that role anymore and it just came out in tears.\u201d\n\nSince it was posted, the video has been viewed more than 1.6 million times, and Courtney hopes that at least some of its viewers might become inspired to get involved in foster care.\n\n\u201cWhatever hoops we had to jump through, we jumped through because Janielle and Elijah are worth it,\u201d Courtney says. \u201cThere was a lot of crying and laughing and screaming in those three years, but we got to the end goal.

{"label": true, "txt": "God must have shipped Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively really hard, because they seem to be a match made in Heaven. Ridiculously good-looking? Check. Talented? Check. Funny as hell? Double-check. It would be gag-worthy if they weren't both so likeable and deliciously irreverent. Ryan Reynolds has always had jokes, but I didn't realize that Blake was capable of such witty banter and flawless trolling until they were married. Obviously they bring out the best (troll) in each other. Following both of them on social media and watching them drag each other in the comments is pure comedy.\n\nSo how did such a compatible power couple meet? Although they were both in relationships at the time, their first encounter was on the set of the movie Green Lantern. A year later, when they were both single and ready-to-mingle, the pair went on a double date (but with other people). Weird, right?\n\n\"That was the most awkward date because we were just like fireworks coming across,\" Ryan told Entertainment Weekly's SiriusXM show. \"It was weird at first but we were buddies for a long time. I think it's the best way to have a relationship is to start as friends.\"\n\nSurprise, surprise, it sounds just like a romantic comedy. No famous couple has made me laugh this hard since Chris Pratt and Anna Farris (RIP), so I sure am glad these two internet trolls found each other.\n\nBust out the popcorn, because here are 23 hilarious times Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds trolled each other on social media. Enjoy.\n\n23 Setting The Record Straight\n\nRumors like this are why we can't have nice things.\n\nThe vast majority of high-profile marriages live under a microscope, but it's even worse if the couple appears to be happy. The tabloids love to expose dirty laundry on celebrities because dirty laundry sells. If the dirt isn't visible, then they will go on the hunt for \"sources\" who will give them the quotes they've been waiting for. Hollywood marriages don't always end due to \"irreconcilable differences\"- sometimes the constant barrage of rumors will tank even the happiest of unions.\n\nRyan and Blake are both successful and well-known, making them the ultimate target for tabloid rumors. The couple seems to ignore the vast majority of bogus headlines, but I guess the claim that Ryan and Blake were \u201cstruggling to spend quality time together\" was just too much for them to take.\n\nLeave it to Ryan to hilariously squash a rumor with the ultimate one-liner. \"I wish. I could use a little 'me time,'\" Ryan tweeted just a week after he and Blake had walked the red carpet together at the New York City premiere of Final Portrait. Any working parent with two kids under five knows the true struggle of finding time for oneself, so this tweet is relatable AF! It's hard to come for someone who playfully trash-talks their own marriage. The tabloid magazine that released this story needs to go back to the hole that it came from.\n\n22 It's The Thought That Counts\n\nMost women would be perfectly happy dealing with burnt Christmas cookies if it meant coming home to Ryan Reynolds every night. Clearly he can't cook worth a damn, but he's gorgeous, funny, and rich. I think I could get over it. Plus it's the thought that counts.\n\nI'm praying that Ryan's toddler was responsible for the icing situation, but I can't be sure of that. Judging by the quality of the baking, I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't know how to ice a cookie any better than a five year old. I love myself some Christmas cookies, but even I would have to draw a line with these. That's saying something, because iced sugar cookies are totally my jam.\n\nI'm guessing this is the last time Blake allowed Ryan in the kitchen, but it kind of paid off in the end (just not with cookies). I bet she took one look at this mess and said to herself, \"yep. This is perfect troll material.\"\n\nThese two are probably always on the hunt for ways to troll each other, even during the Holidays. Blake and Ryan are #RelationshipGoals. Follow them on social media (if you don't already) and just sit back and enjoy the show.\n\n21 GET IT TOGETHER, BLAKE\n\nWhat exactly have you seen three times this week, Blake? Tell me more. No, seriously, we all want to know more.\n\nRyan is trolling Blake pretty hard with this comment, but I can guarantee that she laughed it off. Ryan Reynolds could never be with someone who took herself (or their marriage) too seriously. Maybe that's why it didn't work out with Scarlett Johansson? I don't remember the two of them goofing off with each other online (or anywhere else).\n\nIn my opinion, this kind of playful banter is a sign of a happy marriage.\n\nWhen their kids ARE old enough to read, I bet they'll enjoy watching their parents taking swipes at each other online. It's all in good fun. I'll admit that I wasn't a huge Blake Lively fan at first. When I saw that \"couple picture\" taken alongside \"Cumberswift,\" I remember thinking OMG RYAN WHAT HAVE YOU DONE. Thankfully it seems like Ryan knew something that we didn't- the girl knows how to take a joke. I'm no Hollywood expert or anything, but I'm guessing that's rare for beautiful actress types. Chemistry isn't just about physical attraction- you've got to enjoy each other's company if you want your relationship to stand the test of time. Making each other laugh is a great start. Something tells me these two will be fine.\n\n20 Nice Try, Ryan\n\nRyan and Hugh Jackman first met when they were filming the movie X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Since then they have developed a love/hate relationship on social media that leaves followers equally delighted and confused. Is it a bromance, or do they low-key hate each other? Does the constant shading disguise a tumultuous relationship, or is it all in good fun? Ryan Reynolds trolls Hugh Jackman at every single opportunity, like a little brother who won't stop running into his brother's room uninvited. When Hugh wants to send a fan a birthday message, Ryan starts singing loudly in the background. When Hugh posts a photo of him and his wife for his anniversary, Ryan comments with \"I gave this 3 months. Tops. I was wrong.\"\n\nDespite the constant jokes at each other's expense, at least they're still willing to be photographed together. That's a relief. Blake DID notice the extra space between them and took that opportunity to troll the crap out of her husband, which is fun. Both Blake and Hugh are pretty used to being thoroughly roasted by Ryan, so I'm glad she seized the opportunity to level the playing field. I'm not 100% sure that Hugh \"gets\" their sense of humor, but I'm laughing.\n\n19 Really Feeling Herself\n\nNeither Blake nor Ryan miss the opportunity to playfully throw barbs at each other and we love them for it. There's nothing more annoying than those couples who use social media to wax lyrical about their perfect relationship, is there? I'd rather see a clearly compatible funny couple drag each other on Instagram any day of the week.\n\nWhen Blake posted a picture of herself and hubby Ryan Reynolds exchanging a smile on the red carpet for the premiere of A Quiet Place,\n\ndid you really think she was going to post something sweet?\n\nThis is Blake Lively we're talking about, so of course she saw this as an opportunity for some quality trolling. Complex do-it-yourself braids involving ribbons are truly something to be proud of. I figured all celebrities took the easy way out and used stylists, so good for her! Good hair trumps a good husband every time. Obvs.\n\nOf course Ryan wasn't about to take a roast without clapping back, and his perfect response has me slow-clapping. Keep in mind that Blake posted this picture only a week after Ryan took to Twitter to respond to divorce rumors, so it's double the troll power. They're not only trolling each other, they're trolling the tabloids, too. Well-played, guys.\n\n18 Can The Man Get His Boots Back?!\n\nOnly a tall woman with perfectly toned thighs could pull off this outfit, but her daughter isn't wrong...that dress is SHORT. Is it even a dress, or is she just using it as one? I don't even know. The vast majority of mothers would only wear that outfit if it involved leggings, but Blake Likely isn't most women. Must be nice! If I walked out wearing that outfit, it wouldn't just be my daughter telling me I forgot my pants- it would be the police.\n\nMost guys who saw a picture of their wife wearing something like this would comment with heart or fire emojis, but Ryan Reynolds isn't most men. Ryan took one look at his wife looking sexy and thought IT'S TROLL TIME. I don't think the guy can fall asleep at night without getting all the witty one-liners out of his system.\n\nBlake's boots are definitely making a statement, but I bet this wasn't the statement she was going for. Who knew that Ryan would cop to owning a pair of lace-up black boots? This is Deadpool we're talking about so I guess we should have been prepared for anything. Any opportunity to make people laugh is worth it to Ryan, no matter how self-deprecating.\n\n17 Happy Valentine's Day\n\nI don't know why Ryan is pretending to hold an invisible phone, but Blake clearly had a plan for it. I wonder if she asked him to pose like that on purpose? I wouldn't put it past her. She has a reputation to live up to.\n\nWatching this conversation play out is like watching a really close football game.\n\nOne team scores, then the other team scores, then it goes into overtime and you're not sure who will win. Blake's troll game starts out strong, but then Ryan comes back with a one-liner that has us screaming. Obviously Ryan is looking for real love and not just a brief fling on Twitter. Just when you think Ryan has the game in the bag, Blake comes back to fight fire with fire and scores some points with her Ashley Madison reference. Ryan concedes the fight, because can you really one-up that level of witty? NOPE.\n\nHas there ever been a more compatible couple? I bet these two were exchanging barbs on their first date. In an interview with Good Morning America, Blake explained how she and Ryan have such a good thing going. \"In general, it's nice to have someone who understands what you're doing,\" she said. \"Especially because our job is so weird\u2014you have to be 'married' to other people, it's all so strange. It's never normal, even when you're both doing it.\"\n\n16 Bad Life Choices\n\nBlake Lively is the mother of two, and she recently lost 61 pounds after her most recent pregnancy with the help of her trainer, Don Saladino. She recently posted a picture of her impressive post-baby bod on Instagram, writing, \"Thanks @donsaladino for kickin' my A double S into shape. 10 months to gain, 14 months to lose. Feeling very proud.\"\n\nAt some point Blake must have decided to introduce her trainer/miracle worker to her husband, Ryan Reynolds, but it looks like she might be second-guessing her life choices now that Ryan is bragging about his fitness all over Instagram. Don Saladino, owner of Drive 495, helped Ryan bulk up for Deadpool. Ryan allegedly put on seven pounds of lean muscle for the role, so clearly the Don knows what he's doing if Ryan is already feeling \"4 years younger.\"\n\nBlake isn't here for Ryan's gloating, of course, and let him know it in the comments. \"I've made a terrible decision,\" she writes. I guess Ryan was just sitting around and waiting for the opportunity to exchange a well-timed barb of his own, because the swipe at his wife was quick and to the point (as always). You can always count on Ryan to have the last word.\n\n15 Wandering Eyes\n\nActor Helen Mirren might be 72-years-old, but she still recognizes a fine piece of man meat when she sees it.\n\nHelen, who co-starred with Ryan a couple of years ago in the movie Woman in Gold, recently sang Ryan's praises in a piece she wrote for the annual Time 100 issue. And when I say \"sang his praises\" I mean she might as well be the president of the Ryan Reynolds Ultimate Fan Club, because she had a LOT of good things to say about him.\n\n\"He's the Everyman,\" she writes, \"but somehow with more of everything: wit, elegance, looks and general hunkiness.\"\n\nIt doesn't stop there, though. Not even close. Helen writes, \"I loved Deadpool. But I also miss spending time with the actor who played him\u2014his warm, intelligent, inquisitive brown eyes, his readiness to laugh ... sigh.\"\n\nLAWD HAVE MERCY, Ryan Reynolds done made Helen Mirren sigh.\n\nHELEN MIRREN, the sexiest senior citizen on the planet! Well done, Ryan. After reading that, I'm not surprised that Blake was a little jelly. If Helen was younger there's no way in hell Blake would be joking about this, because the look between the two of them is FIRE. Thank God she's old enough to be his mother.\n\n14 Cropping Out Your Wife Like-\n\nHow the hell was Ryan Reynolds never a stand-up comedian (or on SNL)?\n\nRyan Reynolds isn't the type to miss an opportunity to make a joke on social media, even if it's his wife's 30th birthday. When I first saw this picture I wasn't even sure what I was looking at, but then I saw the caption and I spit out my drink. That's exactly what Ryan intended. Making a funny at his family's expense is what Ryan lives for, but Blake doesn't seem to mind. Ryan makes jokes about his \"daughters\" too, but Blake tells everyone not to take him seriously.\n\n\u201cHe may as well work for the Enquirer,\u201d the Blake told Glamour. \u201cWhen he says \u2018my daughter,\u2019 he\u2019s never, ever talking about her. Everything is a completely made-up scenario.\u201d\n\nRyan will try not to catch Blake completely off-guard with his posts, though. \u201cHe\u2019ll run them by me sometimes just to make me laugh. But oh, I\u2019m so in love with him when he writes that stuff. I mean, I\u2019m in love with him most of the time, but especially with that. I said, \u2018Most of the time,\u2019 because if I say, \u2018I\u2019m so in love with him all the time,\u2019 then you get that eye-rolling, \u2018Oh, her life is so great, she\u2019s so perfect. So it\u2019s, like, my defense mechanism.\u201d\n\nI get that.\n\n13 Perfect Revenge\n\nRemember that time Ryan celebrated his wife's 30th birthday by cropping her out of a picture on Instagram? Blake never forgot it either, and decided to get back at him on his 41st birthday by cropping him out of a photo taken with Ryan Gosling at the Critics' Choice Awards in 2016. NICELY DONE, BLAKE!\n\nThis picture is infinitely better than Ryan's version because Ryan Gosling is a legendary Hollywood heartthrob.\n\n\u201cHappy Birthday, baby,\u201d Lively captioned the picture that featured only half of Reynolds\u2019 face and body. It's pretty harsh when your wife chooses Ryan Gosling's face over yours! Ryan, you really should have seen this coming. Blake's never been one to take things lying down.\n\nEarlier that same day, Reynolds had tweeted about his daughters' attempts to celebrate his big day.\u201cMy kids tried to surprise me for my birthday this morning. I totally heard them coming and snuck out to start a new life somewhere else,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\n\nOf course none of us believe him, but it's still pretty damn funny. It's like every time Ryan successfully trolls his family on Twitter, Blake is waiting in the wings, planning her next attack. She really outdid herself with this one.\n\n12 #NoFilter\n\nRyan never misses an opportunity to poke fun at his wife on Instagram, so when found a snap of Blake sans make-up on the set of The Rhythm Section looking a little worse for wear, he knew exactly what to do with it.\n\nRyan captioned the shot \"#nofilter,\" because he's a braver man than literally every husband in the universe. Sure, it's funny, but it's also risky as hell. My husband knows to run a picture by me before posting it on social media, but I guess the rules don't apply when you're on a movie set. Everyone's about to see her looking like that anyway, but he was still risking her wrath with that caption. It's still up on social media, so I guess he managed to get away with it. I wonder if this was one of those jokes that he had to run by her first?\n\nBlake is totally unrecognizable in this picture. I would have never known this was her if Ryan hadn't posted it. Do you think this is what she really looks like without makeup? I doubt it. They've clearly tried to make as rough as possible for this movie, even down to her wardrobe.\n\n11 That's One Way To Clear Up A Rumor\n\nWho the hell is responsible for writing this? \"Blake Lively And His Mom On Red Carpet After Shutting Down Split Rumors.\"\n\nWhat kind of wording is that? It's no surprise Ryan trolled the shit out of that mess of a headline. Who exactly was on the path to Splitsville here? His mom and Blake? Blake and Ryan? Ryan and his mom? There were so many ways he could have played this, but I personally love that he chose to troll his own mother (and completely ignore his wife).\n\nI don't know if Blake's mother actually rollerblades (I doubt it), but she doesn't look like the type of lady who smokes jazz cabbage.\n\nTo be honest, she doesn't look like she'd even know what \"jazz cabbage\" is. Judging by the quality of that headline, I wouldn't be surprised if that's not even his mom at all! That's probably just a picture of Ryan and Blake posing with a random fan (that actually is his mother, by the way. I looked it up).\n\nI wonder how it feels to be the mother of an famous internet troll (I mean...actor). That's something to be proud of for sure. She probably never even saw this post, though. The Olds aren't always familiar with Twitter.\n\n10 Trolling His Fashion Choices\n\nLet's try to get past the fact that Ryan Reynolds is scary skinny in this photograph and take a look at the trollish caption below it, posted by Blake herself.\n\nAnyone who follows Blake Lively on Instagram knows how obsessed she is with style. Blake once wore 10 outfits in one day during a promo tour for her film All I See Is You (she changed for every single interview). She didn't just switch clothes, though, she switched LOOKS (changing her hair and makeup). Who the hell has time for that? Needless to say, she's garnered quite the reputation for always looking chic and almost never wearing the same outfit twice. I bet her daughters are some of the best dressed kids in Hollywood. I guess she figures her style might rub off on her husband if he would stop being so damn \"lazy.\"\n\nThe thing I love about this tweet is that Blake isn't just trolling her husband, she's trolling herself and the absurdity of changing so many times in one day. Got to love a girl who knows how to laugh at herself. I bet Ryan put on that suit in the morning and didn't take it off until he was ready to go to sleep. Why would he want to? Those are some seriously dapper duds.\n\n9 Ryan Trolls Blake's Birthday (Again)\n\nI just want to know one thing- did Ryan look up other celebrities with the same birthday as his wife for the sole purpose of trolling Blake on her birthday? I think we all know the answer to that.\n\nBilly Ray Cyrus should feel pretty honored to be loved by Ryan Reynolds with his \"whole heart.\" His achy, breaky heart (sorry, couldn't help myself). Between this birthday tweet and the one where Ryan cropped Blake out of her birthday picture, I'm starting to suspect that Ryan plans these things months in advance. He probably has a journal and he just writes ideas down as they come to him throughout the year. As much as he likes to joke about his wife's birthday being an afterthought, I bet he throws big parties for her in real life.\n\nThis trolling doesn't fool us, Ryan. We know you're crazy about her.\n\nIt takes a special kind of woman to be cool with these kinds of posts year-round, but I think Blake really enjoys it. Unlike some women, she's definitely not the \"overly sensitive type.\" Did you know that she even drove her own husband to the hospital when she was giving birth? It's true, and Ryan even admitted it on Twitter. #BossLady.\n\n8 Hear That, Blake?\n\nTweets like this are the reason I love Ryan Reynolds. He's irreverent AF and never afraid to \"go there\" (within reason), and that's a refreshing change in Hollywood. So many A-listers act like they're God's gift to the world, but Ryan's never been like that. He's always down to make jokes about his \"perfect\" life and family and people love him for it. Sure, he's famous and rich and completely untouchable. But tweets like this help you forget that. Ryan just comes off as the guy next door with the jokes.\n\nRyan and Blake will never be known as a couple that's afraid to tease each other. Can you imagine Kanye teasing Kim like this on Twitter? If Kanye said he had a secret family in Denmark I might actually believe him (and so would Kim). When Ryan tweets it, you know it's a joke and you take it in the spirit intended. Both Blake and Ryan are REALLY good at knowing where to draw the line with their playful barbs. Similar to John Legend and Chrissie Teigen, they tease each other with just the right amount of affection and it's adorable. Watching this kind of interaction is way more palatable than watching celebrities couples blow smoke up each other's ass. That's the worst.\n\n7 Happy Father's Day!\n\nTROLL LEVEL: EXPERT.\n\nThere's a reason this picture had to be taken from Buzzfeed instead of Blake's Instagram account. Unfortunately for both Blake and Ryan, this adorable snap of Ryan holding their daughter led to some seriously intense backlash and Blake eventually had it removed.\n\nAlthough Blake's caption is unquestionably hilarious, her Instagram followers immediately took issue with the way the baby was situated in the carrier.\n\n\"The baby should be in a seated position...that is how they are secure. This has nothing to do with anyone thinking they're a better or perfect parent, it has everything to do with caring about the Reynolds' and the safety of their baby,\" one user said.\n\nOthers weren't so kind in their assessment, writing, \"I guess some people don't read the instruction manual!\"\n\nAdriane State, a certified babywearing educator, told Yahoo parenting: \"A wearer should always be able to clearly see their child's face and ensure that baby's airway is clear. Although baby James is not in the most ideal position for this carrier, it\u2019s really wonderful to see a happy dad trying his best to follow his instincts and snuggle his baby close.\"\n\nLord, help us all. This was some quality trolling on Blake Lively's part, and barely anyone noticed because so many parents were up on their high horse. This isn't the America I want to live in.\n\n6 Basketball Jokes\n\nNo, Blake is not coming home from a basketball game dressed in sequins. By the time Blake left her NYC film screening of her movie, All I See is You, she had changed out of a gold dress and into a glittery, sequined jersey. Apparently this basketball-inspired getup was her seventh outfit change of the day (remember what I told you earlier)?\n\nBut I digress. Blake posted this picture and captioned it \"the balls to my basket\" because she's not afraid to objectify the shit out of her husband on social media. I'm here for it! If my man looked like that I'd be objectifying him every single day! Referring to your man as nothing but a set of balls is both tacky and wonderful all at the same time. I was expecting Ryan to see this and post a witty comeback, but I guess he didn't mind the description. I'm pretty sure most men wouldn't mind the description, especially if it was coming from Blake Lively. Blake probably wore this outfit just so this caption could be born! I wouldn't believe it of any other person, but this is Blake and Ryan we're talking about. You know I'm right.\n\n5 She Just Had To Say It\n\nSome things are just too gross to be joked about, and the \"two girls, one cup\" video is one of them. I've never even seen the video, but I know what happens. I chose not to watch because I enjoy eating too much to lose my appetite for life.\n\nI don't know what's going on here, but this photo doesn't LOOK staged for a nasty caption. Ryan isn't even looking at the camera, yet his hand somehow found its way to Blake's chest (but she doesn't seem too surprised to see it there). Was this caption what she had in mind? Did she actually say \"hang on a sec, let's do a two Deadpools, one cup picture,\" or did the inspiration strike when she was posting it on Instagram?\n\nWho the hell knows with these two. I wouldn't put it past them.\n\nOn another note, this is the most normal outfit I've ever seen Blake Lively wear. Who knew she owned jeans and a pair of chucks? Check out her Instagram page and you'll see what I'm talking about. The woman practically lives in gorgeous designer dresses! She probably wears luxurious dresses to bed, just for fun, and wakes up looking like a goddess! Not even fair.\n\n4 He's No Scientist\n\nI don't know what kind of cake this is, but it looks delicious. Well, at least it did before he mentioned the glue.\n\nIf Ryan really did make this cake (he's wearing an oven mitt, so he at least we know he got it out of the oven), then I'm pretty impressed right now. At least I think that's a cake. I can't really tell under all of those strawberries and that white glue-like icing, but I guess we'll have to take his word for it. Leave it to Ryan to do something sweet for his wife and then make a joke about it. He's simply not the type to do something mushy and then add an even mushier caption, like \"made this for my love bug!\" Every caption is an opportunity to roast himself or someone else. If Ryan ever starts posting sweet pictures and writing super-sentimental captions to his wife (or anyone else), then someone call the police because he's clearly been kidnapped and someone has hacked his account. Ryan doesn't want you to be impressed by his prowess in the kitchen, or by anything else! He simply wants his followers to know that he made his wife a cake using glue. He's an actor, not a scientist! What did you expect?\n\n3 #DeadCool\n\nDid you know that Ryan Reynolds has been bombarded by sick fantasy tweets on social media for years? Some of these are pretty freaking weird, too. One woman tweeted Ryan, asking him to kick her in the chest and drag her across the pavement. Instead of being disturbed, Ryan tweeted back in typical Ryan Reynolds fashion. \"I'm currently lost in prayer. Maybe later.\" Another Twitter user asked if he would mind poking her with chopsticks (you can't make this crap up). His answer? \"Sorry, just trying to get this wild dolphin untangled from a fishing line.\"\n\nWith hilarious comebacks like that, is it any wonder that fans are desperate to get close to him?\n\nIt kind of makes you want to tweet him just for a funny response. When Twitter user Scott Jenkins tweeted concern about how Ryan's wife feels about all these kinky \"fan requests,\" Ryan didn't miss a beat. \"Pretty sure it's my wife writing most of those. Sounds like her.\"\n\nHAHAHA! The quips just keep coming. I wonder if Ryan is just as funny in person as he is on social media. I would be really disappointed if I met him and didn't hear at least one witty one-liner (preferably at his wife's expense).\n\n2 ...Then There's Blake\n\nThis caption made me laugh out loud, but I was surprised to see that it had been removed from Ryan's Instagram account. Ruh-roh. Do you think it's because he took it a little too far for Blake's liking? Did Ryan finally cross the line? Maybe.\n\nCould anyone other than Ryan Reynolds could get away with writing a caption like this? Because I don't think they could. We've all gotten used to Ryan's sense of humor by now and simply accepted that his wife will often be the butt of his jokes. This caption was obviously written in jest, but for Blake, it might have crossed a line. Or maybe Ryan just regretted it and took it down himself, without any prompting. I guess we'll never know. I definitely think it would have been too much if Ryan had not included himself as one of the \"most beautiful, considerate, and loving people\" he's ever known. That shit's just funny.\n\nAll jokes aside, can we just talk about how adorable his two little girls are? These lucky girls will never have to worry about suffering through years of \"Dad jokes,\" because their dad is legitimately hilarious. My only regret is not dying sooner and missing the chance to be reincarnated as one of Ryan and Blake's daughter. Rats.\n\n1 That's Real Love\n\nReal love is when you check your partner's teeth before a big event, isn't it? I once went to a fundraising gala without realizing I had red lipstick all over my two front teeth, but my gem of a husband was willing to hide behind a wall and wipe it off for me with a napkin. That's love right there.\n\nLeave it to Ryan to re-post one of his wife's Instagram \"fan\" pictures for the express purpose of trolling the hell out of it.\n\nRyan's not a big fan of sugary sweet posts like this to begin with. Now that he mentions it, it does look like he's giving Blake's teeth a thorough inspection. Blake probably lives off of granola and chia seeds, so it's good that he was looking out for her. All this talk of teeth has me wondering why Ryan's teeth are so much darker than Blake's. Did she just get a whitening treatment the day before? I bet Ryan's teeth are just a normal shade of white, but they look almost brown in comparison. Maybe he was just marveling at the fact that her teeth could be so blinding. It doesn't seem natural. Must be a Hollywood thing."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Photo: Netflix\n\nYes, there are spoilers below about Stranger Things and Stranger Things 2. If you haven\u2019t watched yet and want to remain spoiler-free, please keep that in mind.\n\nStranger Things was an instant sensation when it debuted on Netflix last year. Its potent blend of frights, \u201980s nostalgia, and the revival of Winona Ryder\u2019s career made it a hit with fans and critics alike. But there was one thing that Stranger Things fans loved above all else: Barb.\n\nIn season one, Barbara Holland was Nancy Wheeler\u2019s best friend, the nerdy high-schooler clad in Sally Jesse Raphael\u2019s glasses and a puffy, ridiculously cerulean parka. Barb was quiet but loyal, awkward but fabulous, forgotten by Hawkins, Indiana but remembered by the entire audience. She was so great, in fact, actress Shannon Purser nabbed an Emmy nomination for the part. Sadly, Barb was also one of the demogorgon\u2019s first victims. While everyone raced ahead to rescue Will Byers from the Upside Down, Stranger Things treated Barb\u2019s death with the sort of shrug normally reserved for dropping a coin down a storm drain or losing a half-broken umbrella. She was last seen in the Upside Down, with a gross slug monster crawling out of her corpse, and that appeared to be that.\n\nNow, with Stranger Things 2 set to dominate TV marathons this weekend and beyond, one question looms large: Will we finally get justice for Barb?\n\nThe second season opens with Nancy (Natalia Dyer) furious that no one really knows what happened to her friend. The trench coats at the Department of Energy stashed Barb\u2019s car at a bus station, so everyone in Hawkins thinks that she skipped town because teens kept mocking her proto-normcore fashion sense. \u201cIt\u2019s like everyone forgot, and no one cares,\u201d Nancy tells her boyfriend, Steve (Joe Keery). \u201cExcept her parents \u2026 and it\u2019s destroying them.\u201d\n\nCut to the Holland residence, where Nancy and Steve suffer through an excruciatingly sad dinner of KFC with Barb\u2019s parents as penance for knowing what really happened but not being able to tell them. Mr. and Mrs. Holland believe their daughter is still out there, and they\u2019re selling their house to pay a shady investigative journalist to track her down. Understandably, Nancy reacts to this news by getting wasted at a house party and slurring to Steve, \u201cYou\u2019re pretending like everything\u2019s okay. Like we didn\u2019t kill Barb. Like we\u2019re partying. We\u2019re partying.\u201d\n\nThe funny thing about Stranger Things 2 is that it basically mimics the format of Stranger Things original recipe. Will (Noah Schnapp) is in danger again. Both seasons feature a new girl wreaking havoc with the group dynamic of Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin). Will\u2019s mother Joyce Byers (Winona Ryder) once again goes from a well-coiffed cashier to someone with the hair of a Times Square Elmo. And just like last time, Nancy has to leave Steve and join up with Will\u2019s brother Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) in order to find Barb.\n\nSoon enough, Nancy learns that the \u201cjournalist\u201d is a conspiracy-theory nut named Murray Bauman (Brett Gelman), who believes that Barb tried to help the \u201cRussian girl\u201d who was seen around town \u2014 a.k.a. Eleven. His working theory is that Barb was killed because she knew too much. So, in a pretty ingenuous move, Nancy and Jonathan get themselves captured by the feds and taken to Hawkins Lab, where they meet Dr. Owens (Paul Reisder) and record him admitting what really happened to Barb. Then they take the tape to Murray in hopes of exposing the truth to the wider public.\n\nWhen they arrive at Murray\u2019s bunker, he has a wall dedicated to his Barb investigation and all of his \u201cevidence\u201d is connected with red strings. (He\u2019s basically like Carrie Mathison when she goes off her medicine, but I looked at that wall and thought, \u201cSame,\u201d because that is what my apartment looked like in the middle of my Barb fever too.) Nancy tells Murray that he has everything wrong about Barb and fills him in on the truth about the Upside Down. After he hears the tape of Dr. Owens, they come up with a plan to water down the story so that the press will actually report it. Then, for several episodes, Stranger Things yet again forgets about Barb while Nancy and Jonathan hook up, Eleven goes to Chicago to turn herself into Jessica Alba from Dark Angel, Steve reveals the secret to his pompadour come mullet, and everyone fights a bunch of devil dogs (a much better name than \u201cdemodogs,\u201d in my humble opinion).\n\nWith all of those non-Barb objectives complete, our heroine finally gets a funeral after the Department of Energy admits culpability in her death, claiming that she was poisoned and they conspired to cover it up. Presumably, Barb\u2019s parents got a nice settlement and Murray got paid, which is kind of ridiculous because Nancy and Jonathan did all the hard work. (All he did was lie around his nasty apartment, listening to jazz and drinking watered-down Stoli. Shouldn\u2019t the teens get a cut too?)\n\nIn the end, Barb is still dead and now everyone knows it, but they think that she was a mere victim of government malfeasance rather than the prey of an interdimensional alien that stalked her after her Nancy bailed to have sex with Steve. She gets some photos placed at the center of some nice bouquets during her funeral, but that\u2019s about it. She\u2019ll probably be forgotten again by the time Stranger Things 3 comes around.\n\nClearly, this is not what true justice looks like. Justice for Barb would be if someone actually appreciated her. If someone saw Barb for who she was and said, \u201cShe was great and she deserved better.\u201d Nancy is grappling with a lot of difficult emotions in Stranger Things 2, and she does the admirable thing by helping the Hollands find closure, but she\u2019s mostly just driven by a need to assuage her own guilt. That\u2019s not justice as much as it is penance.\n\nGet all your Stranger Things 2 questions answered at the show\u2019s Vulture Festival LA panel on November 18! Tickets available here."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Happy birthday, Ariana Grande!\n\nThe \"No Tears Left to Cry\" singer turns 25 on Tuesday, and in honor of her special day, ET is breaking down all the clues that this will be her best year yet, both personally and professionally.\n\nGrande kicked off her career as an entertainer in 2008 when she landed a role in Broadway's 13. But it wasn't until 2010 that she started to become a household name among teens everywhere when she starred as the adorable, quirky Cat Valentine in Nickelodeon's Victorious, as well as the show's short-lived spinoff, Sam & Cat, with Jennette McCurdy until 2014.\n\nWhile the brunette beauty certainly made a name for herself as an actress, her dreams of becoming a pop star were clear right from the start. For years, Grande expressed her passion for music in various interviews, belting out tunes behind the scenes and frequently sharing her future goals for a career in the music industry.\n\nTimothy Hiatt/Getty Images\n\nShe made those aspirations a reality in 2013 with the release of her debut album, Yours Truly, which featured her first big hit, \"The Way.\" She followed it up with My Everything in 2014, and Dangerous Woman, featuring Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne, Macy Gray and Future, two years later.\n\nGrande has had massive success an artist thus far, but her star power is about to shine even brighter during year 25. Here's why:\n\nSHE'S GOT NEW MUSIC...\n\nOne week ahead of her birthday, Grande gave fans a surprise gift by unlocking her fourth studio album, Sweetener, for pre-order, along with the catchy promotional track \"The Light Is Coming.\" The song and its accompanying music video, which features Minaj and was produced by Pharrell Williams, has already received rave reviews from her loyal fan base of Arianators.\n\nIt's clear Grande is coming in hot with a brand new sound for Sweetener, available Aug. 17, and we can't wait to hear what else the powerhouse singer has up her sleeve.\n\n...A NEW FIANCE\n\nGetting engaged is one way to kick off another year older! Saturday Night Live star Pete Davidson put a ring on it earlier this month, proposing to Grande with a stunning sparkler that cost $93,000 and was commissioned by New York City jeweler Greg Yuna.\n\nInstagram\n\nThe lovebirds haven't been able to contain their excitement about their future together, with Davidson confirming the news during a recent appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, and calling the engagement \"a dream\" via social media.\n\n\"I feel like I've won a contest,\" the 24-year-old comedian marveled. \"It's so lit.\"\n\n...A NEW HOME\n\nFollowing their engagement news, Grande and Davidson moved into a lavish apartment in New York City, and according to their Instagram Stories, they are in the exciting process of buying furniture and decorating their first place together.\n\n\"[They're] excited for the next chapter,\" a source said.\n\nAn additional source told us that the newly engaged couple actually purchased the 4,023 square-foot apartment, which features five bedrooms and four and a half baths, and is located in Chelsea, a hip and upscale neighborhood in Manhattan.\n\nStreetEasy.com\n\n...AND A NEW FRAGRANCE!\n\nAs if working on an album and getting engaged wasn't enough, Grande has also been putting her business skills to good use with the release of CLOUD. The perfume sounds like a dreamy delight, as its smell is described as a mix of \"lavender blossom, forbidden juicy pear and mouthwatering bergamot\" with a \"whipped touch of cr\u00e8me de coconut, indulgent praline and exotic, vanilla orchid.\"\n\nKnowing what we know about Grande, we can't imagine her beauty biz will stop here!\n\nHER CONFIDENCE IS ON FIRE.\n\nGrande still loves rocking her signature ponytail these days, but we were ecstatic to see her experiment with a few different looks this past year, including going blonde, makeup-free and even wearing her hair down for various appearances.\n\nAndrew Lipovsky/NBC\n\nIt seems as if she's become more confident in recent years, tapping into her sexy side and letting go of insecurities. Plus, it looks like Davidson is helping her out in that area, too, making her feel like \"the hottest girl in the world\" in person and on social media:\n\nSHE'S GOT A WEDDING TO PLAN!\n\nWhat could be more exciting than that? Though a source previously told ET that Grande and Davidson will have a \"long engagement,\" we have a feeling the birthday girl won't be wasting any time working on all the details for her upcoming nuptials. In fact, Grande has actually been dreaming up her big day since she was a teenager.\n\n\"Ariana has talked about marriage since she was 15,\" an additional source told ET. \"During her teen years, she was always very dreamy about a wedding and she used to call friends and talk about one day having that one special person.\"\n\n\"Ariana also spoke about a winter wedding, which seemed a little cold, but she loves the idea of a winter wonderland-type scene,\" the source added. \"We used to laugh about her fun ideas of a snowy wedding day.\"\n\nAND MAY BE GOING ON TOUR?\n\nNo official word yet, but the Boca Raton, Florida, native seems to be hinting that one might be coming! In addition to the upcoming release of her new album, which includes \"presale access to tickets for a future Ariana Grande headline tour\" when you pre-order, Grande has already created a collection of rad Sweetener merchandise.\n\nSlay, birthday girl!\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nPete Davidson in Awe of Ariana Grande as He Shares Sexy Pic of Fianc\u00e9e in Lingerie\n\nPete Davidson On Ariana Grande Engagement: 'I Feel Like I Won A Contest'\n\nInside Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson's Lavish New York City Apartment (Exclusive)\n\nRelated Gallery"}
{"label": true, "txt": "Ask and you shall receive: After a swarm of messages from fans demanding it, HBO announced Big Little Lies is officially returning for a second season. It makes total sense why the network wants to continue this franchise. For one, people loved it: The season one finale brought in a whopping 1.9 million viewers , which is huge for premium cable. It was also a critical favorite, sweeping both the Emmy and Golden Globe Awards. Will lightning strike twice, though? Based on what HBO's released about season two, it seems like yes. The brand has all the ingredients to make a phenomenal second season (including Meryl Streep).\n\nUntil then, here's everything we know about Big Little Lies season two:\n\nIt's not airing until 2019. Unfortunately, it'll be a while before Madeline Martha Mackenzie and her one-liners are on your screen again. Production on Big Little Lies season two is slated to start in spring 2018.\n\nMost of the original cast is expected to return. HBO has only confirmed Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman at this point. However, the network said in a press release most of season one's cast is expected to return, and negotiations are underway. All the original actresses are said to be receiving significant pay bumps, as well.\n\nAlexander Skarsg\u00e5rd is back too. His character, Perry Wright, was murdered at the end of season one, but TV Line confirms he'll still pop up around Monterrey, California\u2014presumably in the form of flashbacks. Of course, Skarsg\u00e5rd did tell people.com , \"I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m really dead or not,\" but he was most likely just teasing.\n\nSeason two will be just as dramatic (and violent) as the first. In its original release, HBO teased that \"relationships will fray\" and \"loyalties will erode\" in season two. Plus, \"the potential for emotional and bodily injury shall loom.\" So that basically means someone's going to get hurt.\n\nThere will be seven episodes. Just like season one.\n\nDavid E. Kelley, the screenwriter who crafted season one, is returning. He'll write all seven scripts for season two, based on a story ideated by Big Little Lies author Liane Moriarty.\n\nAndrea Arnold will direct season two. She's directed episodes for some of the best shows on TV, including Transparent and I Love Dick, along with some incredible indie films, like American Honey. She's replacing Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e, who helmed all seven episodes in season one and is returning to season two as an executive producer.\n\nMeryl Streep is joining the cast. Which is a huge deal. She'll be playing Mary Louise Wright, the mother of deceased Perry, who comes to Monterrey concerned for her grandchildren.\n\nShe's not the only new character, either. Casting is underway for Bonnie's (Zo\u00eb Kravitz) parents, Elizabeth and Martin Howard. In addition, there will be a new employee at Otter Bay School who befriends Jane, and together they swap their \"deepest secrets.\" Finally, a new socially conscious teacher at Otter Bay, Michael Perkins, will cause drama when his lessons about global warning give Amabella panic attacks. (Can't this girl live for five seconds?) The actors for the latter two characters haven't been announced yet. Dennis O'Hare is also joining the cast as Ira Farber.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\nBig Little Lies Will Introduce a Completely New Character in Season 2\n\nBig Little Lies Season 2 Is Officially Happening\u2014With a Female Director\n\nRiverdale Totally Referenced 'Big Little Lies' on This Week's Episode"}

The tour began on May 8, 2018 in Glendale and concluded on November 21, 2018 in Tokyo, comprising 53 concerts. The supporting acts for the tour were Charli XCX, Camila Cabello, and Broods.\n\nOn Swift's 29th birthday on December 13, she announced that a concert film of the same name would be released on Netflix on December 31, 2018.[3]\n\nDevelopment\n\nIn August 2017, Billboard reported that Swift would be using Ticketmaster's Verified Fan program to prevent bots and ticket scalpers from purchasing tickets. The program, named \"Taylor Swift Tix\", allowed fans to purchase tickets in advance of the public on-sale by participating in boost activities to increase chances of getting a pre-sale access code.[2][4]\n\nOn November 13, 2017, Swift's management announced the first round of dates for the tour jointly with Ticketmaster.[5][6] Tickets went on sale to the general public on December 13, 2017, the day of Swift's 28th birthday.\n\nIn late November, Swift announced shows in Manchester, Dublin, and London. Due to overwhelming demand, additional dates were announced for all three cities. Furthermore, the singer also announced extra shows in North America for Pasadena, Chicago, East Rutherford, Foxborough, Toronto, and Atlanta due to popular demand before the pre-sale began.[7][8] On December 3, Swift announced five dates for Oceania.[9][10] In January 2018, due to huge demand, Swift went on to add second dates in Santa Clara, Landover, Philadelphia, Minneapolis and Arlington and third dates in East Rutherford and Foxborough, totalling 40 shows for the tour's North American leg.[11]\n\nOn March 1, 2018, Swift officially announced Camila Cabello and Charli XCX as the opening acts for the Reputation Stadium Tour.[12] Cabello was previously speculated as the opening act because her Never Be the Same Tour dates didn't coincide with Swift's tour dates;[13] Portland's Live 95.5 also announced her in a sweepstake for the concert of June 22, 2018 at the Wembley Stadium in London through a since-deleted post on Twitter, a day before Swift confirmed her as the opening act.[14]\n\nOn May 8, 2018, Swift announced two shows in Tokyo, with Charli XCX as the opening act.[15] In September 2018, Broods was announced as an opening act for the Oceania leg of the tour.[16]\n\nCritical reception\n\nThe tour has received rave reviews, being commonly labeled as the best of Swift's career thus far and the best tour of 2018.[17][18][19] Ed Masley, from The Arizona Republic, wrote that \"there were many moments in the course Swift's performance that felt like she was playing to the back rows of the stadium by simply sharing with her fans\", while complimenting the tour's production and highlighting Swift's connection with the crowd.[20] Jim Harrington, from The Mercury News, praised the improvement of the singer's vocal work and performance skills over the years: \"Her game is well-rounded enough that she can excel equally at every different aspect of the show.\"[21] Chris Tuite, from CBS San Francisco, wrote: \"The only thing more prominent than the singer herself during her current costume-change filled spectacle are the massive, vicious looking snakes that symbolically appear throughout the set.\"[22] Michael Tritsch from 303 Magazine commented the tour \"broke new ground and set the bar high for future stadium tours\" while adding \"The reputation of this show burned its way into the history books\".[23]\n\nCommercial performance\n\nTicket sales\n\nAfter four days of sales through the Verified Fan platform and three days of sales to the general public that began December 13, the tour had already grossed $180 million from 33 dates in North America alone.[24] Pollstar reported data supplied by the Gridiron Stadium Network, a consortium of NFL facilities that work together to book concerts at their buildings, which showed at least 35,000 tickets had been sold at ten of the stadiums on the route as of December 18. The tickets sold ranged from 35,419 at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh to a high of 48,039 at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia. With more than 47,000 tickets sold, it was reported the May 12, 2018 date at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara was generating close to $9 million in ticket revenue, which prompted the addition of an extra date.[25]\n\nAccording to StubHub, the tour is the best-selling female tour in the United Kingdom in 2018.[26]\n\nBoxscore\n\nThe first seven shows of the tour grossed $54 million with 390,000 tickets sold, leading Swift to the top of Billboard's Hot Tours chart in June 2018.[27] She performed to sold out crowds of 59,157 in Glendale and 107,550 in Santa Clara (over two nights), grossing $7.21 million and $14 million respectively, while the Pasadena shows combined for a gross of nearly $16.3 million and Seattle accounted more than $8.6 million.[27][28][29] The concerts in Louisville and Columbus, reported in July 2018, grossed $11.5 million with around 115,000 tickets sold, with the latter city having the highest gross and most tickets sold, with approximately 63,000 tickets and $6.6 million. These concerts led the singer once again to the top of Hot Tours chart.[30]\n\nRecords\n\nThe tour has broken multiple venue attendance and grossing records. The debut performance at University of Phoenix Stadium set new venue records in both gross and attendance, topping Metallica's $5.2 million gross earned in August 2017 by almost $2 million. With 59,157 tickets sold, she also broke the attendance record set during One Direction's Where We Are Tour in 2014 by 2,633 seats.[31] With a $14 million take from 107,550 sold tickets at Levi's Stadium she topped her own gross and attendance counts set during The 1989 World Tour in 2015. With more than 118,000 fans in attendance at the Rose Bowl, the two-show run earned $16.2 million and set a new gross record for a single headliner at the venue, surpassing U2's 2017 record by over $467,000. Grossing records previously set by U2 as well were broken at Seattle's CenturyLink Field, where she topped their Joshua Tree Tour 2017 gross by $2.4 million, and Denver's Sports Authority Field at Mile High, where she surpassed the $6.6 million gross set by the band in 2011 during their 360\u00b0 Tour by $1.2 million.[27]\n\nSwift made history by becoming the first female artist to headline Dublin's Croke Park twice, with reportedly 136,000 fans in attendance.[32][33] Similarly, she achieved the milestone of becoming the first woman to headline three consecutive nights at MetLife Stadium[34] and Gillette Stadium.[35]\n\nFollowing the tour's 29th show in North America at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami, it had grossed $202.3 million in the continent ($191.1 million in the United States and $11.1 million in Canada) thus breaking Swift's own record of the highest grossing North American tour by a female artist, previously held by The 1989 World Tour, with fewer dates.[36]\n\nThe tour became the highest grossing of all time in United States history, grossing $266.1 million in just 38 dates, besting The Rolling Stones' $245 million gross from their A Bigger Bang Tour in 2005-07. It also sold a whopping 2,068,399 tickets in the country.[37]\n\nSet list\n\nThis set list is from the concert on May 8, 2018 in Glendale, Arizona. It is not intended to represent all shows from the tour.[38]\n\nNotes During the first show in Landover, the second show in Philadelphia, the third show in East Rutherford, and the second show in Tokyo, Swift performed \"So It Goes...\" in place of \"Dancing with Our Hands Tied\". [39]\n\nDuring the second show in Philadelphia, Swift performed \"Our Song\" and \"Wildest Dreams\" a cappella after the levitating basket stage used during \"Delicate\" malfunctioned. [40]\n\nDuring the second show in East Rutherford, Swift performed \"Clean\" before the \"Long Live\" / \"New Year's Day\" medley.

{"label": true, "txt": "The deal includes an apology and money for the First Lady.\n\nFirst Lady Melania Trump has settled her defamation lawsuit against Mail Media over a Daily Mail story that suggested she was an escort when she emigrated to the United States in the 1990s.\n\nThe parties announced the resolution in a joint press release that shares word that Mail Media is making an apology as well as paying her an unspecified amount of money to end the lawsuit.\n\nMs. Trump sued in September 2016, during the heat of the campaign and with immigration as one of the election's biggest issues. She first filed her case in Maryland and took issue with an Aug. 19 article titled, \"Naked photoshoots, and troubling questions about visas that won't go away: The VERY racy past of Donald Trump's Slovenian wife.\"\n\nRepresented by Charles Harder, the same attorney who represented Hulk Hogan's privacy suit against Gawker Media, the lawsuit targeted a story that discussed \"highly-charged, lesbian-themed, nude photographs\" and also questioned the exact timing of when she traveled to the U.S. on a visa. Much of the article relied on the work of a Slovenian journalist who had co-authored an unauthorized biography of Ms. Trump. There was some reliance on a Slovenian magazine to make the claim that the modeling agency she worked at was run by a New York entrepreneur, who allegedly also operated an escort agency for wealthy clients. The story also suggested that she and Donald Trump met three years earlier than they acknowledged and \"staged\" their actual meeting as a \"ruse.\"\n\nMs. Trump also sued a Maryland blogger named Webster Griffin Tarpley, who made similar claims on his website.\n\nThe litigation triggered an interesting showdown over jurisdiction with a Maryland judge ultimately agreeing this case wasn't for her courtroom.\n\nThe case was then refiled, without Tarpley, in New York, and the case made more news with new pleadings that talked about lost business opportunities for Ms. Trump at a time when her husband was attempting to very lightly distance himself from a business empire for ethical reasons.\n\nBut the case won't last long.\n\nThe Daily Mail has now agreed to a retraction.\n\n\"We accept that these allegations about Mrs Trump are not true and we retract and withdraw them,\" the publication's parent company said in the statement. \"We apologise to Mrs Trump for any distress that our publication caused her.

{"label": true, "txt": "In one of the more sensitive data breaches in recent memory, hackers have broken into a high profile, London-based plastic surgeon, and stolen a bevy of photos, including of in-progress genitalia and breast enhancement. The hackers, known as The Dark Overlord, have traditionally tried to extort their victims, including schools, medical centres, and even a production studio linked to Netflix.\n\n\u201cWe can confirm that the Clinic has been the victim of a cyber attack. We took measures to block the attack immediately in order to protect patient information and we informed the Metropolitan Police who launched an investigation,\u201d London Bridge Plastic Surgery (LBPS), the victim of the hack, told The Daily Beast in a statement.\n\n\u201cRegrettably, following investigations by our IT experts and the police, we believe that our security was breached and that data has been stolen. We are still working to establish exactly what data has been compromised,\u201d the statement continued.\n\nLBPS, based near Marylebone, describes itself as \u201cone of the leading plastic surgery clinics in the UK\u201d on its website. Judging by tabloid media reports, paparazzi have spotted British celebrities attending the clinic, and UK paper The Sun reported that TV star Katie Price is an LBPS customer.\n\n\u201cWe have TBs [terabytes] of this shit. Databases, names, everything,\u201d a representative from The Dark Overlord told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cThere are some royal families in here,\u201d the group claimed.\n\nThe clinic caters to less famous patients too, with plenty of customers praising the company on social media.\n\n\u201c The clinic staff treated me so so well, with a warm, caring, empathic approach that immediately eased any anxieties I was feeling at the time,\u201d one apparent customer recently wrote on Facebook.\n\nThe Dark Overlord contacted this reporter using an email account belonging to LBPS to prove they had access. The group also sent The Daily Beast a cache of photos of LBPS operations. Many are highly graphic and close-up, showing surgery on male and female genitalia. Others show apparent patients\u2019 bodies post-operation, and some include faces.\n\nNone of a selection of tested photos returned any matches from Google reverse image searches, implying that they were indeed obtained from a private source. Several pictures include LBPS\u2019 chief surgeon Chris Inglefield, wearing his distinctive, multi-colored head scarves. In one image, he is wearing an identical head scarf to that in an image on LBPS\u2019 website.\n\nAs if the hack itself wasn\u2019t enough of an issue, the hackers have threatened to distribute the stolen images.\n\n\u201cWe're going to pitch it all up for everyone to nab. The entire patient list with corresponding photos. The world has never seen a medical dump of a plastic surgeon to such degree,\u201d The Dark Overlord told The Daily Beast last week. The images do not appear to be publicly available yet, however, and it\u2019s unclear whether the group will follow through on their threat.\n\n\u201cThis blokes balls were nicked mate!\u201d the representative added, referring to a specific photo in the cache. The group often mocks or taunts its victims, both in public social media posts or during interviews with reporters.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a straight male, yeah?\u201d they continued. \u201cHow about some actual real vaginas,\u201d they said, before sending this reporter several sets of graphic photos. LBPS confirmed the data breach after The Daily Beast provided a number of the clinic\u2019s photos to representatives.\n\nAfter the publication of this article, a Metropolitan Police Service spokesperson told The Daily Beast, \"On Tuesday, 17 October the Metropolitan Police Service was informed of a data theft from a cosmetic surgery clinic in London. Detectives from the Met's Organised Crime Command are investigating. There have been no arrests and enquires are ongoing.\"\n\nThe Dark Overlord first emerged in mid-2016, when they hacked a myriad of medical centers across the U.S., then moved onto commercial businesses and most recently schools. Earlier this month, The Daily Beast reported the group sent a flurry of death threats to students of an Iowa school district. Education officials closed a number of schools in response.\n\nUsually, The Dark Overlord will hack a victim, steal their data, and then demand a ransom payment in exchange for not publicly releasing the, often sensitive, information. When that doesn\u2019t work, the group may approach journalists in the hope that media coverage will put more pressure onto the target. LBPS\u2019 statement did not explicitly mention an extortion attempt.\n\nIn all, The Dark Overlord has hacked well over a dozen targets, mostly, it appears, in the U.S., but some overseas. Senator Steve Daines recently raised concerns about the group with FBI Director Christopher Wray, the Flathead Beacon previously reported.\n\n\u201cWe are horrified that they have now targeted our patients,\u201d the LBPS statement continued.\n\n\"Security and patient confidentiality has always been of the utmost importance to us. We invest in market-leading technology to keep our data secure and our systems are updated daily. We are deeply saddened that our security has been breached. We are profoundly sorry for any distress this data breach may cause our patients and our team are available around the clock to speak to anyone who has any concerns by calling 0203 858 0664,\u201d it concluded.\n\nThis story has been updated to include comment from a Metropolitan Police Service spokesperson."}

{"label": true, "txt": "The scandal that has destroyed the reputation of Hollywood mega mogul Harvey Weinstein appears to be widening its scope to the point that it might take down actor and filmmaker Ben Affleck, too.\n\nAffleck, like other prominent figures in Hollywood, has publicly denounced Weinstein, declaring himself \u201cangry and saddened\u201d at the allegations that Weinstein has harassed and assaulted multiple women throughout his career, and saying that reading details of the accusations \u201cmade him sick.\u201d\n\nBut in speaking out against him, Affleck \u2014 a close colleague and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Weinstein\u2019s \u2014 seems to have only inspired people to share accounts of the harassment he has allegedly committed himself. Multiple women have come forward with accounts of harassment from Affleck, both on- and off-camera, as well as stories they say prove he has been complicit in other men\u2019s harassment of women.\n\nAs Anna North wrote here at Vox, when one woman comes forward with a story of sexual assault, she inspires a domino effect: More women feel that it is safe to come forward with their own stories, so what started out as a case built around Ashley Judd and a few other women saying on the record that Weinstein harassed them became a case with dozens of accusers.\n\nAnd the domino effect can work between cases, too. Multiple sources have said that women began to speak out against Weinstein because they saw what happened to Roger Ailes and Bill O\u2019Reilly and Bill Cosby when women joined together to share their stories. Now, the domino effect seems to have spread from Weinstein to Affleck.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is whether it will do more than cause a temporary scandal, and whether it will ever lead to actual consequences with measurable, lasting effects.\n\nAffleck\u2019s past includes a lot of time spent around men facing sexual harassment accusations, and a lot of time on camera groping women\n\nOne reason that Affleck has become something of a secondary target as fallout from the Weinstein scandal spreads is that he spent much of the last year helping his brother Casey Affleck successfully campaign for an Oscar, even as the story emerged that Casey had faced two sexual harassment lawsuits in the past. Ben appeared at parties and premieres with Casey in what looked like an attempt to whip up support for Casey\u2019s Best Actor run, and he certainly never made a public statement condemning Casey\u2019s alleged sexual harassment \u2014 a fact that many observers were quick to point out when he made a statement condemning Weinstein.\n\nIt also doesn\u2019t help Affleck that he\u2019s spent his own career so close to Weinstein. Weinstein produced Affleck\u2019s breakout movie, 1997\u2019s Good Will Hunting, and they\u2019ve collaborated multiple times since then. While Affleck has been publicly ambivalent about their relationship \u2014 \u201cThey\u2019re a nightmare to make a deal with,\u201d he told Vanity Fair in 2004 of Miramax, Weinstein\u2019s film studio at the time \u2014 Affleck and Weinstein continued to work together on projects like Shakespeare in Love and Jersey Girl. And according to actress Rose McGowan, who has heavily implied that Weinstein raped her without actually naming him, Affleck knew exactly what Weinstein was allegedly up to with the women he surrounded himself with.\n\nBen Affleck fuck off \u2014 rose mcgowan (@rosemcgowan) October 10, 2017\n\nSo Affleck has a history of appearing to support men who have been accused of committing sexual assault, a history that is fresh in the public\u2019s mind. And it seems to have prompted multiple people to remember that Affleck also has a history of publicly groping women under the cover of frat-boy humor. Most infamously, he is said to have groped the breasts of One Tree Hill actress Hilarie Burton when they appeared on MTV\u2019s TRL together in 2003.\n\nI didn't forget. \u2014 Hilarie Burton (@HilarieBurton) October 10, 2017\n\nIn the segment, Affleck (who was 31 at the time) wraps his arm around Burton (then 21) and slides his hand down and out of the frame, apparently tweaking her breast, while Burton laughs uncomfortably. \u201cThat\u2019s a move,\u201d he tells the camera nonchalantly.\n\nThe episode cuts to a talking head confessional. \u201cSome girls like a good tweakage here and there,\u201d Burton says. \u201cI\u2019d rather have a high five.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was a kid,\u201d she wrote on Twitter this week, adding, \u201cI had to laugh back then so I wouldn\u2019t cry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI acted inappropriately toward Ms. Burton and I sincerely apologize,\u201d Affleck responded on Twitter.\n\nIn another video that resurfaced this week, Affleck pulls interviewer Anne-Marie Losique onto his lap and comments on her breasts while filming a 2004 segment for the Canadian TV series Box-Office. \u201cEverything you know about Affleck is wrong,\u201d says the summary for the video on YouTube, apparently uploaded by an independent party in 2006.\n\n\u201cThey would like it better if you did the show topless, the station, wouldn\u2019t they?\u201d he says, appearing to hold Losique down on his lap as she squirms. \u201cYou usually show a lot more cleavage than this,\u201d he adds. \u201cWhat\u2019s the story? Why are you covering it up today?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Sunday morning,\u201d Losique says, laughing.\n\n\u201cThat never stopped you before from getting them titties out,\u201d Affleck says, smirking. He pulls her in tighter and hugs her. \u201cThese breasts are very firm, suspiciously firm, I have to say.\u201d\n\nIn an interview this week, Losique told the Hollywood Reporter she was not uncomfortable with Affleck\u2019s behavior. \"This was for the camera,\" she said. \"You have to understand that we have done dozens and dozens of interviews like that. It was for a show I was producing, so I was not at all a victim. When the cameras rolled, we would start to do that game. As soon as it stopped rolling, there was none of that. He never touched me in any improper way. He was very respectful, I must say.\"\n\nBut while Losique may not have minded Affleck\u2019s advances, other women have come forward to say that Affleck groped them in public as well \u2014 and that he did not have their consent and they most certainly did mind.\n\nI would also love to get an apology from Ben Affleck who grabbed my ass at a Golden Globes party in 2014. \u2014 Annamarie Tendler (@amtendler) October 11, 2017\n\nI was also at this party and *multiple* friends had this same exact experience. https://t.co/GlSIllKqAJ \u2014 Jen Statsky (@jenstatsky) October 11, 2017\n\nTV writer Jen Statsky and author Annamarie Tendler both say that Affleck groped multiple women at a Golden Globes party in 2014. \u201cHe walked by me, cupped my butt and pressed his finger into my crack,\u201d wrote Tendler on Twitter, adding, \u201cI guess he tried to play it like he was politely moving me out of the way and oops touched my butt instead of my lower back?\u201d Affleck has not publicly commented on Tendler\u2019s allegations.\n\nThe emerging narrative about Affleck has been met not with surprise but with resigned acceptance and disgust: Yes, that tracks, seems to be the overwhelming sentiment. Affleck has publicly associated with men accused of sexual harassment for so long that it feels shocking less because these allegations are emerging, and more because they didn\u2019t emerge years ago. If it\u2019s common for Affleck\u2019s younger brother and close professional colleague to allegedly harass the women around them without any apparent disapproval from Affleck, the thinking goes, it doesn\u2019t seem implausible that Affleck himself would also harass the women around him.\n\nIn 2017, a sexual harassment scandal can hurt a career. But it won\u2019t necessarily end one.\n\nIt seems likely that Harvey Weinstein is going to be cut out of Hollywood for a long, long time. Maybe he'll even be cut out for longer than the eight years Mel Gibson spent in exile after he was caught on tape telling his wife she deserved to be gang-raped before he returned to the fold this year with an Oscar nomination for directing Hacksaw Ridge. And as Ben Affleck gets caught in the domino effect, he too might have to take a break from public life and his film career.\n\nAs more and more women come forward to speak out against powerful men in Hollywood with allegations of sexual harassment, assault, and rape, it\u2019s become less dangerous to make these allegations. There\u2019s less fear of being blackballed for the rest of your career, or having every detail of your past dug up and legislated on CNN.\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear that these allegations actually end the careers of the men who face them. And it has yet to be proved that any of them will ever face legal consequences.\n\nWoody Allen, accused of pedophilia, is still working. So is Roman Polanski, convicted of statutory rape in 1976. To date, Bill Cosby has faced no legal punishment for his alleged serial rapes. Neither has Johnny Depp, accused of domestic abuse.\n\nSo as Harvey Weinstein goes down, he may take Ben Affleck down with him. But it remains to be seen whether the consequences Affleck faces will be either extensive or meaningful."}

{"label": true, "txt": "The Recording Academy Producers & Engineers Wing's 11th annual celebration on Jan. 25 took on a New York state of mind this year, following the 60th GRAMMY Awards to the Big Apple and honoring GRAMMY winners Alicia Keys and Kasseem Dean, aka Swizz Beatz.\n\nInside The 2018 P&E Wing Celebration\n\nHeld at the iconic Rainbow Room, perched 65 floors above the landmark Rockefeller Center, the exclusive, invite-only event brought together the community of recording studio professionals in a new way this year. The room was filled with industry titans, such as GRAMMY winners Peter Asher, Ed Cherney, Tony Visconti, and Chick Corea, and current GRAMMY nominees Morgan Heritage and Lisa Loeb \u2014 all of whom came out to celebrate their craft and honor Keys and Dean.\n\nUpon arrival, the couple was greeted on the red carpet with the first of several spontaneous group singings of \"Happy Birthday,\" meant for Keys, who coincidentally received this honor on her birthday. And the excitement of the evening was two-fold for the birthday girl in light of being honored side-by-side with her husband.\n\n\"The coolest thing, I think, for [The Producers & Engineers Wing] to honor both of us is that we do very different music,\" said Keys. \"There is no limit to the music, and how it can be created and how it touches people, and to celebrate \u2026 our different styles, that's what I love the most because music doesn't just happen in one way. Everyone in that room does music differently, and we're all dope for it.\"\n\nA 15-time GRAMMY winner, Keys exemplifies versatility, making her mark in the music world as a singer/songwriter and producer, as well as an actress, author, activist, and philanthropist. Since the 2001 release of her debut album, Songs In A Minor, Keys has sold more than 30 million albums worldwide.\n\nHowever, her impact on music and culture reaches far beyond sales tallies. The New York native's message of female empowerment and her authentic songwriting process have made her an inspiration for women and aspiring creatives worldwide.\n\n\"There's a ton of things I'm passionate about,\" said Keys, \"and to continue to share our experience and go deeper into how we can collectively create powerful change is definitely a focus for me.\n\nSwizz Beatz has helmed countless big records dating all the way back to 1998 when he produced his first hit, DMX's \"Ruff Ryders' Anthem.\" In his career spanning more than two decades, he's worked in multiple genres with artists such as Jay-Z, Madonna, Kanye West, and Metallica.\n\n\"He helped paint the picture for hip-hop as it is today,\" said GRAMMY-winning producer and current GRAMMY nominee Jimmy Douglass.\n\nHis deep influence on modern hip-hop aside, Swizz Beatz went on to graduate from Harvard Business School's Owner/President program and has built a legacy and a body of work that cannot be contained by the recording studio walls. He entered into a joint venture with Clive Davis at age 23. He's since gone on to launch successful ventures into fashion design, fine art, and philanthropy on his way to becoming a renowned cultural ambassador and natural born modern-day Renaissance man.\n\nNow Keys and Dean can add a new award to their collection, joining previous P&E Wing honorees such as Quincy Jones, Neil Young, Rick Rubin, and Jack White.\n\nAlicia Keys & Swizz Beatz Accept 2018 P&E Honors\n\n\"This is a major honor, this is a blessing to see so many creative people in one room,\" Swizz Beatz said as the couple took the stage. \"I never would have expected to be on this stage, especially next to this shining bright star. It shows you that hard work doesn't go unnoticed.\"\n\nTo all the creatives in the building,\" Keys said, addressing the crowd, \"May we all continue to be inspired, may we all continue to be brave, may we all continue to be unafraid of being our brightest best selves. \u2026 There is no limit to what we can do and how far we can go.\"\n\nDean added, \"The sky is not the limit, it's just the view,\" and the room whipped into a frenzy.\n\nFollowing the couple's acceptance speech, a special guest was called to the stage to pay tribute to the honorees: GRAMMY-winning jazz-fusion pioneer Chick Corea.\n\n\"Everyone in that room does music differently, and we're all dope for it.\" \u2014 Alicia Keys\n\n\"Swizz and Alicia are living works of art, so this is dedicated to them,\" Corea announced before leading the room in a sing-a-long rendition of \"Spain,\" as requested by Keys herself.\n\nThen the jam ensued. Corea called Keys and Dean back to the stage to play, sans rehearsal. They broke into an impromptu version of \"Summertime,\" with Keys trading soulful vocal runs with Corea's mind-bending piano licks, followed by an improvised jam that featured Swizz on beatbox, Corea weaving the keys through his rhythms, and Keys leading an audience down-home call-and-response.\n\n2018 P&E Wing Celebration\n\nIt's safe to say this night was special, not only for the stars of the show but for the community of hard-working producers and engineers the Recording Academy \u2014 and the P&E Wing \u2014 support and represent.\n\nCatching Up On Music News Powered By The Recording Academy Just Got Easier.

While shooting The Late Late Show across the pond, Corden staged an Andrew Lloyd Webber-themed edition of the segment, featuring songs from some of the composer's best-known musicals.\n\n\"So we're back. We're on home shores,\" says Corden, introducing the segment. \"There are really only two events that everyone in Britain circled on their calendar this year. One, the royal wedding, which, you know, happened, and two, this: Crosswalk the Musical.\"\n\n\"Gather around everyone. Gather around,\" Corden tells his theater troupe. \"To commemorate our return to this greatest of isles, Great Britain, we will be celebrating the work and career of one of the true legends of the stage. None other than Mr. the Lord Lloyd Andrew Lloyd Webber.\"\n\nThe performers then crowd the legendary composer before Corden yells at them. He then curtsies in front of Lloyd Webber, who asks, \"What are you doing down there? Get up.\"\n\n\"To have Lloyd Andrew Lloyd Webber choose us to help him celebrate his 70th year is the icing on the icing on the cake. It's a cake with two icings, which sounds incredible,\" says Corden.\n\nHe explains that the group will perform a medley of songs from the composer. The host then realizes that he may have been saying Lloyd Webber's name wrong. \"I feel like I'm saying it wrong. Is it Lloyd Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber?\" he asks. The composer responds, \"Lord Lloyd.\"\n\n\"To be honest, when James asked me if he could perform my musicals at the crosswalk I couldn\u2019t believe it,\" says Lloyd Webber while Corden pushes a huge ball of red yarn as he trains the performers. \"I thought the production could use some youth and energy, so I've asked the cast of my School of Rock musical to come by. I think James is going to absolutely love it.\"\n\nAfter watching the young cast perform, Corden appears unimpressed. \"Yeah, we had to let them go. Attitude problems,\" he says.\n\nCorden later gives Lloyd Webber the opportunity to read the cast list, which reveals that Corden has been cast in all the main roles.\n\nThe first musical number the ensemble performs is from Evita. Corden wears a strapless white dress as he takes on the role of Eva Peron. Lloyd Webber can be seen watching the performance and holding a playbill on the sidewalk. The composer throws a bouquet of roses to the cast after the performance, at which Corden screams, \"He's throwing them to me.\"\n\n\"Patti LuPone, Madonna, Elaine Paige and I don't want to say it, but I think James Corden is now top of that list, \" says Corden of his place among well-known actresses that played Eva Peron. Lloyd Webber later says, \"Yeah, well, he's definitely bottom of the list.\"\n\nThe theater group then takes on a musical number from Cats. While preparing for the performance, they easily get distracted by a pedestrian's dog.\n\nThe group then performs a number from Phantom of the Opera. \"Where's my Christine?\" asks Corden, who is dressed as the phantom. \"We don't have a Christine. Who is playing Christine?\"\n\nIn desperate need of an actor for Christine, Corden calls in a favor. Josh Gad then shows up to help out. \"You know, once you've appeared in one Crosswalk the Musical, you become like a member of the company for life. We're like theatrical Navy SEALs,\" says the star of Crosswalk the Musical: Beauty and the Beast.\n\nFollowing the number, Lloyd Webber praises Gad's performance. \"Josh, you're gorgeous and marvelous,\" he says. A jealous Corden tells Gad he can leave.\n\nThe final performance by the group is \"Any Dream Will Do\" from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. The elaborate performance draws a positive review from Lloyd Webber. The group, including the composer, then take their final bow and receive a round of applause from the people stuck in traffic."}
{"label": true, "txt": "NPR Music's 35 Favorite Songs Of 2018 (So Far)\n\nEnlarge this image Angela Hsieh/NPR Angela Hsieh/NPR\n\nThe best songs from the first half of 2018 serve many functions. Some reveal pain, others relieve it. Some guide us forward through the darkness, others eradicate it like a firework. Here are 35 favorites that put in work for us, each one the personal choice of one person at NPR Music or one of our partner stations around the country. (If you're into playlists, there's one here.) We didn't vote or haggle; we each reached into our hearts and picked what nestled closest. As one of these songs puts it in less printable fashion, we didn't really care too much if no one else liked it. Well, maybe we care a little \u2014 here's hoping you find a new favorite, too.\n\nCourtney Marie Andrews\n\n\"May Your Kindness Remain\" YouTube\n\nCould we be in the market for a new anthem? May I propose the title track from Courtney Marie Andrews' latest album, May Your Kindness Remain? Its message speaks to what is important in life; not the money or accoutrements, but the call to our better angels. Andrews' voice soars with passion, conviction and the tenderness of true understanding. Music can deliver empathy, allow you to hear the words of another and feel their truths. In this mean season, we must remember to be mindful of little things, which just might be the biggest thing after all. \u2014 Jessie Scott, WMOT's Roots Radio\n\nBal\u00fan\n\n\"El Espanto\" YouTube\n\nBal\u00fan's \"El Espanto\" is an innovative exploration of Puerto Rican folk music and electronic production that takes music from the island to another level entirely. The delicate vocals are part of an arrangement that thrives on upbeats and clever drumming. This track is just a hint of what's in store \u2014 I've heard the upcoming album and it's going to blow your mind. \u2014 Felix Contreras, Alt.Latino\n\nBig Red Machine\n\n\"Hymnostic\"\n\nThere is something about a gospel hymn, regardless of your religious stripes, that immediately invokes a spirit of love and good will. Even non-believers can be moved to tears by a choir, or a single voice, singing about a higher power, our earthly struggles and redemption. In the case of \"Hymnostic\" by Big Red Machine, this type of comfort can be found not in a house of worship, but online, in a similarly welcoming and communal atmosphere, where a collective of artists are sharing their music directly with fans, for free.\n\nBoth the band and the new digital platform, PEOPLE, are parts of a collaboration between Aaron Dessner (The National) and Justin Vernon (Bon Iver). The gorgeous and moving \"Hymnostic\" (perhaps an amalgam of \"hymn\" and \"agnostic\") brings the communal essence of these projects to life, with lyrics co-written by the contemporary artist Ragnar Kjartansson, and featuring Dessner on piano, Vernon's unmistakable falsetto, Brad Cook (Megafaun, Hiss Golden Messenger) on omnichord and a choir of friends, including The Staves, Kate Stables (This Is The Kit), Lisa Hannigan and Richard Reed Parry (Arcade Fire). If a piece of music can make you feel as though you've been invited to share in the beauty of community and lose your troubles for a while, the gospel truth is in the final line of the song, as Vernon sings the promise: \"I'll be singing for your health, I'll be righteous, you'll see.\" \u2014 Carmel Holt, WFUV\n\nBlack Pumas\n\n\"Black Moon Rising\" YouTube\n\nGrammy-winning producer and Brownout guitarist Adrian Quesada has been the man behind the curtain for so many projects that it has become a bit of a running joke. The Austin musician is relentlessly driven, and has found lots of success my digging into deep psychedelic grooves. Yet none of his endeavors has leapt out of the gate quite like Black Pumas. Led by newfound vocalist Eric Burton's commanding soul, Quesada and crew have become Austin's hottest new band based on one dubbed-up single. \u2014 Jeff McCord, KUTX\n\nLeon Bridges\n\n\"If It Feels Good (Then It Must Be)\" YouTube\n\nBest known for his slow-burning retro soul ballads, this song finds Leon Bridges steppin' out with something for the dancefloor. As the title suggests, the good feeling is pretty immediate. The mid-tempo shuffle-and-clap groove and hooky Nile Rodgers-style guitar line makes for an undeniable summer party starter. It also shows a different side of Bridges' music, exploring a more contemporary, uptempo R&B mode. He seems conscious of the shift in tone, singing \"we don't have to act so serious, like no one's watching, only us.\" As this young artist continues to evolve on his sophomore album, Good Thing, it's nice to hear him take fun and confident strides to wider audiences. \u2014 Jason Bentley, KCRW\n\nJoseph Calleja\n\nAh! Si, ben mio... (Verdi: Il trovatore)\n\nYouTube\n\nThe overall plot of Verdi's Il trovatore might be far-fetched, but few could fail to relate to the sentiment in this stirring aria. Boy tells girl he'll be braver and stronger with her at his side, even in the face of death. It's classic Verdi, with a potent blend of urgency, natural beauty and a melody that sticks in your head. Rare is the tenor, from any era, who can top Joseph Calleja's distinctive, old school phrasing or match the golden warmth of Italian sunshine that radiates from every perfectly focused note. \u2014 Tom Huizenga\n\nCar Seat Headrest\n\n\"Nervous Young Inhumans\" YouTube\n\nCould this be Will Toledo's most optimistic sounding song? \"Nervous Young Inhumans\" comes on like a runner's high, a sunrise of synthesizers and electronic drumbeats inviting the listener to jog along to the newly recorded version of this 2011 Car Seat Headrest deep cut. Like the rest of Twin Fantasy, a slight rewrite of the song's lyrics and a massive overhaul of its production helps to usher Toledo's lesser-known material into a new era, drawing a line from the scrappy coming-of-age stories and bedroom recordings of his early career to the barbed, avant guitar-pop of his present and future. \u2014 Andrea Swensson, The Current\n\nCardi B feat. SZA\n\n\"I Do\" YouTube\n\nThis track is syrupy trap goodness. Moody production courtesy of Murda Beatz sets the vibe for SZA's sweetly sung braggadocious hook, teasing what at first feels like a CTRL bonus track. But once Cardi B comes in with one line after another worthy of being printed on a T-shirt, she reminds us why her 15 minutes of fame are lasting long as hell. This song is sticky and fun, and Bardi delivers a banger. This is the perfect song to listen to right before a power meeting. \u2014 Silvia Rivera, Vocalo Radio\n\nThe Carters\n\n\"Black Effect\"\n\nThe eighth song on Jay-Z and Beyonce's surprise collab album, Everything Is Love, \"Black Effect\" marries blackness and culture capital in a matrimony full of alchemy-level whimsy. The spellbinder opens with a modest explanation of the most multi-faceted emotion known to many by Dr. L'Antoinette Stines \u2014 the kind of warm wisdom received on a rainy afternoon from across a kitchen table. From there, HOV and Bey ascend over a bass-injected Flower Travellin' Band sample to deliver a sermon on black strife and prosperity. Jay likens himself to Malcolm X and puffs his chest over his fraternal familiarity in any black mecca (\"I'm good on any MLK Boulevard\"). Bey pays homage to Sarah Baartman, Prince and Shawty Lo and breaks with the beat for a moment to proclaim, \"I will never let you shoot the nose off my pharaoh.\"\n\nWith pop culture references spanning centuries and drawing from music, politics, fashion and beauty standards, the pair trade verses and ad-libs about how the nuances of black culture \u2014 and themselves, by default \u2014 have come to be the nucleus of these worlds without proper recognition. \u2014 Sidney Madden\n\nChildish Gambino\n\n\"This Is America\" YouTube\n\nMore than a month has passed since the release of Childish Gambino's visual gut punch \"This Is America,\" and I'm still unpacking the shock it elicited the moment it hit the web. Was it the 400 years of American violence and racial exploitation Donald Glover distilled into four minutes of graphic symbolism? Was it the impact of his truth juxtaposed against the utter fiction spoken the same week by Kanye West when he alluded to slavery being a choice? Or was it seeing the guy who'd quietly infiltrated the industry a decade ago in Tina Fey's 30 Rock writers room suddenly reveal the depths of his radical blackness? The brilliance of \"This Is America\" is that Gambino refuses to provide any easy answers. Instead he uses a cacophony of stark imagery \u2014 from the gun-splattered gospel choir to the pale white horse obscured by dancing schoolchildren \u2014 to question the myriad ways the nation employs black entertainment as a distraction, and abstraction, from the violence aimed at black America everyday. \u2014 Rodney Carmichael\n\nYears from now, when I try to unlock the memory of what 2018 felt, smelled and looked like, \"This Is America\" will take me there. I'll remember the smile that spread across my face in the first 50 seconds \u2014 that fun, feel-good opening, with joyous chanting and Donald Glover's playful lyrics about just wanting to party. But then I'll remember the drop, and the horror, and the revelation. For me, this year of music began and very well may peak with this song. \u2014 Jessi Whitten, CPR\n\nChristine and the Queens\n\n\"Girlfriend\" YouTube\n\nThis is more than just the queer anthem of the year, though that's already saying a lot. \"Girlfriend\" is supercharged fun: It's got swagger to burn from the opening note; it's got all the right musical nods, from MJ to Daft Punk and it's got the lyrical weight to carry it beyond pop. Christine is actually H\u00e9lo\u00efse Letissier, a French singer-songwriter (check out the French version of \"Girlfriend,\" too) with a flair for theater and performance art \u2014 and a great dancer, too. If you agree that a macho girlfriend is what this world needs now, sidle up to Christine and the Queens! \u2014 Rita Houston, WFUV"}

So says a lawsuit filed in federal court Wednesday, in which Flav accuses Public Enemy co-founder Chuck D and two business managers of cheating him out of royalties and merchandising revenue.\n\nFlav \u2014 real name, William Drayton \u2014 contends that his Public Enemy royalties have dwindled to almost nothing in recent years.

{"label": true, "txt": "[This story contains major spoilers from the entire sixth season, including the finale, of Netflix's Orange Is the New Black.]\n\nOrange Is the New Black had a lot to say about freedom, time and the current climate with its supersized finale \u2014 aptly titled \"Be Free.\"\n\nJenji Kohan's prison dramedy ended its sixth season (which bowed Friday on Netflix) with a game-changing twist for the show's most dedicated viewers: leading inmate Piper Chapman (played by Taylor Schilling) was let out of prison on early release. Despite having eight months left on her prison sentence, Piper was pushed to the top of Litchfield's inmate release pile and she gained her freedom back in the final moments of the 84-minute finale.\n\nHer season-six ending stood in stark contrast to the devastating sentences handed down to two non-white, less privileged inmates: Taystee Jefferson (Danielle Brooks) was convicted for the murder of corrections officer Desi Piscatella (Brad William Henke) \u2014 one she didn't commit \u2014 and will now be serving a life sentence; and Blanca Flores (Laura Gomez) is being transferred to an immigration detention center after mistakenly believing that she, too, was getting out on early release.\n\nExecutive producer Tara Herrmann tells The Hollywood Reporter that Piper's release has long been on the writers' minds, since Orange Is the New Black is based on the story and memoir of the same name by Piper Kerman, who served 13 months of her 15-month sentence in a minimum security prison.\n\n\"Of course the thought of releasing Piper has come up in previous seasons because the real Piper's sentence was 15 months and we want to make sure that we can fully tell the story of what it\u2019s like for Piper on the outside,\" Herrmann tells THR of what's to come. Orange has long been renewed for a seventh season, and will begin production later this summer. \"We just want to make sure we didn\u2019t do it too soon in her complete arc as a series, but it seemed like the time was right. It felt like we had sort of seen her full time in accordance to what the real story was for the real Piper.\"\n\nIndeed, the real Piper wrote a memoir, inspired a TV show and now serves as an advocate for prison reform; she is also a show consultant on Orange. Herrmann says the prison dramedy plans to follow its Piper on the outside just as much as it did on the inside, and that season seven will track Piper's post-prison journey. \"She's the grounding force of the show,\" Herrmann adds of Schilling's Piper staying put.\n\nDespite the early release surprise, Piper exhibited mixed feelings about her freedom. Not only does the idea of assimilation on the outside loom, but she's leaving her new wife Alex Vause (Laura Prepon) behind. To celebrate her release, Alex threw Piper a surprise prison wedding, officiated by fellow inmate Nicky Nichols (Natasha Lyonne). \"As we were thinking of Piper on the outside, having them be married creates a lot more stories for us and possible conflict,\" says Herrmann about the relationship at the center of the show.\n\nBrian Chamberlayne, who wrote the finale, said the wedding was emotional for the cast to film, since it doubled as both Piper's goodbye and the end of Schilling's on-set prison stint. (The episode was directed by castmember Nick Sandow.) \"There was a weird mix of emotion that day for Taylor\u2019s last day shooting in the prison \u2014 realizing that she\u2019s really getting out of this place,\" Chamberlayne tells THR. \"There\u2019s excitement but there\u2019s also a sense of loss, and I think that Piper is feeling that as well. That\u2019s something I was trying to portray: the excitement of getting her freedom, but then also leaving Alex and this place behind that she\u2019s become accustomed to.\"\n\nAlex, after all, still has four years left on her sentence. \"What's significant to come out of the wedding is that, in the way that weddings are for most people, it was a statement to each other and to the people around them that they\u2019re going to try their hardest,\" says Chamberlayne of Piper and Alex's future. \"It might not be legal, but it was a big deal that they got to do that. Especially given how long it\u2019s going to be before they see each other again, physically, and have physical contact.\"\n\nPiper's mixed feelings were evident as she watched the kickball game between the inmates of C-block and D-block play out, an activity she fought for in her final days inside \u2014 only now, she watched from the other side of the fence. When her brother, Cal Chapman (Michael Chernus), asks her what she is going to do next, she offers no answer and the screen fades to orange.\n\n\"There\u2019s that moment before Piper's release where she\u2019s scanning the cell block and kind of just taking everyone in, and it\u2019s a little bit like how you don\u2019t fully get the understanding of a place until it\u2019s about to go away,\" he explains. \"That\u2019s when you take it all in, and Piper has that moment as well.\"\n\nChamberlayne joined the Orange writers room in season six and, after writing the second episode of the season, \"Sh*tstorm Coming,\" he was given the momentous finale. Not only did the episode need to properly send off Piper, her ending also had to play out parallel to the devastating developments for Taystee and Blanca, two topical story arcs that feel personal in the writers room.\n\n\"This is a huge episode for Piper,\" Chamberlayne says. \"That was really important to me, to Jenji and to the room that we did her a service by portraying her final moments in prison properly. Piper\u2019s story in the finale, especially, and over the course of the season was the one that we honed the most in on to make sure that we were doing justice to her time in prison and showing exactly what she learned and how she\u2019s grown \u2014 that she\u2019s not that same person that walked in those prison doors.\"\n\nOne of the scenes that both shows Piper's growth as well as how her story parallels to Taystee's was in the 11th episode, \"Well This Took a Dark Turn\" (which was directed by Prepon), when Taystee and Piper have a conversation about Piper's privilege in the prison hair salon ahead of Taystee's trial.\n\n\"That was, as a room, something we leaned into as one of the most important moments of the season,\" says Chamberlayne. \"Especially for Piper\u2019s arc in prison, to come out of it with this understanding that she got it hard in prison and people didn\u2019t let up on her, but so many of these women have it hard on the outside and that\u2019s part of the reason they went after Piper in prison.\"\n\nHe adds, \"This contrast of her fish-out-of-water story, which is for minorities and people who are underprivileged classes, that\u2019s constant. That\u2019s the world that they inhabit every day. It was important to all of us to make sure that we highlighted that.\"\n\nDespite having the backing of the ACLU and Black Lives Matter, Taystee is convicted for second-degree murder in the death of Piscatella only moments after she explains to former warden Joe Caputo (Sandow) that there is no justice for inmates like her or the late Poussey Washington (Samira Wiley). As a former lawyer who worked on appeals for inmates who had received unjust sentences, writing Taystee's verdict was personal for Chamberlayne.\n\n\"It's important to us for all the characters that we do justice to the people who are going through this experience, who are currently incarcerated or who are dealing with the aftermath of incarceration and what its effect is on their life, so the examination really is of the system,\" says Chamberlayne of reflecting reality through Taystee. \"We\u2019re hoping that, through these stories, we can talk about the issues we have with the system and then also tell the human stories of these peoples\u2019 lives and the struggles that they face.\"\n\nFor three seasons now, the once-lively Taystee has been through a series of heartbreaking endings. \"Danielle is an amazing actress and we like to see her be fun \u2014 because she\u2019s so funny as well as being great about the dramatic stuff \u2014 but you want to tell the story that\u2019s true to that character and true to the world we live in. We talk about this a lot but you don\u2019t have a choice but to get a little heartbreaking at times,\" he says.\n\nHerrmann adds of the breakout character: \"We\u2019re craving old Taystee but the reality is that this is what happens. It\u2019s out of their control; it\u2019s out of her control. She\u2019s such a light \u2014 the character and the actress \u2014 so we always hope to show light and darkness. I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll get to that place again, but for now, this is the reality that she\u2019s living in. Just awful.\"\n\nAnd the same goes for Blanca's storyline, which opens the door for Orange to tackle the U.S. immigration crisis in season seven. The announcement that MCC, now rebranded as PolyCon, was moving into the business of immigration detention centers is a prescient punch \u2014 though it was written months ago, the new season dropped only one day after the court-ordered deadline to reunite separated migrant children under the Trump administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy.\n\n\"Jenji came in at the beginning of season six stating that one of the clear things she wanted to do was address immigration detention centers \u2014 that\u2019s something she was adamant about,\" says Chamberlayne of plotting the timely deportation storyline. \"We had spoken to some immigration attorneys and the way that Blanca\u2019s story has worked out, it was a perfect opportunity to start to tell that story.\"\n\nFor Chamberlayne, the ending came full circle. His first episode of the season, \"Sh*tstorm Coming,\" provided the first hint that viewers should be worried about Blanca's fate. \"The FBI agent is looking at her case file and saying, 'Wait a second,'\" he recalls. \"Then having this moment, it was absolutely heart-wrenching to write. The actors had really delivered in the way they play Blanca and Diablo's (Miguel Izaguirre) relationship, and I think it\u2019s an important story to be telling, especially now. Very significant. I\u2019m really glad that Jenji came in with that and allowed me to see it through.\"\n\nHerrmann says that Blanca's transfer gives Orange the opportunity to tackle more immigration-related storylines, especially since the show threw out its own timeline so it could play out in the year 2018. \"Things change every day, every minute, in terms of what\u2019s going on with the policies,\" she says. \"So we hope to tell some of those stories in the next season, but because it\u2019s ever-changing, we don\u2019t want to get too detailed in true hopes that by the time our next season airs it\u2019s a whole different thing. We look to be able to organically find these things within the characters and the stories that we\u2019ve already created.\" She adds, \"But immigration has been an issue here in the country since it was born.\"\n\nIn addition to unjust sentences and the immigration crisis, Orange continued to shed light on the country's opioid epidemic with Daya Diaz (Dascha Polanco) developing a heroin addiction now that she, too, is serving out a life sentence for the death of C.O. Humphrey (who viewers will recall, was actually killed by Kukudio, who is now dead). Daya, in a devastating turn, now values drugs and her power relationship with her supplier, new inmate Daddy (Vicci Martinez), over that of any family members on the outside, including her daughter and mother, Aleida (Elizabeth Rodriguez).\n\nAlong with Daya, Alex, Taystee and Nicky, the following inmates are alive and ready to continue serving out their time in max come season seven: Frieda Berlin (Dale Soules), Suzanne Warren (Uzo Aduba), Pennsatucky (Taryn Manning), Cindy Hayes (Adrienne C. Moore), Flaca Gonzales (Jackie Cruz), Maria Ruiz (Jessica Pimentel), Zirconia (Daniella De Jesus) and new villain Badison (Amanda Fuller). Red (Kate Mulgrew) and Gloria Mendoza (Selenis Leyva) are in SHU at the season's end, and Sophia Burset (Laverne Cox) gets out on early release.\n\nMeanwhile, Lorna Morello (Yael Stone) has gone into a worrisome early labor and the villainous Denning sisters, Barb (Mackenzie Phillips) and Carol (Henny Russell), murdered each other, effectively saving the kickball game from turning into a deadly prison gang war. The season also provided glimpses at Lolly Whitehall (Lori Petty) in the max psych ward and a retired Sam Healy (Michael Harney). Caputo, who quit his job, is left morally grappling with Taystee's verdict and leans on new girlfriend Fig (Alysia Reiner), who provided an unexpected foil to MCC's Linda Ferguson (Beth Dover) throughout the season.\n\nA handful of Orange characters, however, were still missing-in-action by the season's end. The season very briefly showed some of the inmates from the other bus from the fifth season finale \u2014 Big Boo (Lea DeLaria), Ouija (Rosal Colon) and Helen Van Maele (Francesca Curran) were sent off to a prison facility in Ohio.\n\nBut a handful of memorable inmates never appeared. Most notably, Janae Watson (Vicky Jeudy) and Alison Abdullah (Amanda Stephen), Brook Soso (Kimiko Glenn), Yoga Jones (Constance Shulman), Leanne Taylor (Emma Myles) and Angie Rice (Julie Lake), Kasey Sankey (Kelly Karbacz) and Brandy Epps (Asia Kate Dillon), and, most obvious of all, Maritza Ramos (Danielle Guerrero). Chang's (Lori Tan Chinn) absence signals that the inmate who walked through the hole in the fence during the riot remains an unaccounted-for fugitive.\n\nBoth Herrmann and Chamberlayne spoke about the cast trimming that had been predicted ahead of the season, explaining why it was time to refocus on a core group of characters.\n\n\"The change of location provided the opportunity, in that the first season is Piper being a fish-out-of-water in the prison,\" says Chamberlayne. \"We get to know all these characters around her, so it\u2019s only fitting that when we\u2019re coming to the end of her story in prison that we see those same characters that we met in season one in this new location where they\u2019re all fish-out-of-water. They\u2019re having to make new friendships and bonds and also learn how to survive in a different way. That was another thing that Jenji came in and said at the beginning of the season. She knew that she wanted to do that and I\u2019m really grateful to her for giving us the groundwork.\"\n\nHerrmann has explained the Orange storytelling process of not leaving any extra ideas untold by season's end. Whether or not some of the missing characters will return for season seven will largely depend on what fits with the ideas that come out of the writers room for season seven.\n\n\"If the story takes us there, it has to be organic for us,\" she says. \"We never want to suddenly be in a world that we haven\u2019t set up. But we love those characters and miss them as storytellers for sure, so we hope to always see them.\"\n\nThe 13-episode sixth season of Orange Is the New Black is streaming now on Netflix.

The Toronto native seemed to pop out of nowhere when he began seeing the outgoing Kardashian sister, and fans were rooting for the duo when they announced that they were expecting their first child together in December of 2017.\n\nThough Thompson was a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers, which was then led by basketball legend LeBron James, most of us had no clue that when he was drafted into the NBA in 2011, he was the fourth overall pick which at the time was the highest drafted Canadian-born player in NBA history. With such promise in his career, and coming from a family of athletes, we wondered just how wealthy Thompson is, and if his wealth could even touch that of the Kardashian dynasty.\n\nKhlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Tristan Thompson | Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Tristan Thompson | Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian via Instagram\n\nA questionable track record\n\nAt just 27 years old, Thompson has already made quite a name for himself. He\u2019s a 2016 NBA champion and the founder of the Amari Thompson Fund which was created for Thompson\u2019s younger brother who has the neurological disorder and experiences seizures almost daily. With all of that, the 6\u2032 10\u2033 player seemed to have a lot going for him.\n\nHowever, when Thompson began dating Kardashian, fans of the reality star were shocked to learn that the NBA star had recently broken things off with his ex-girlfriend, a model named Jordan Craig, who also happened to be pregnant at the time. Craig gave birth to her and Thompson\u2019s son, Prince Oliver, on December 12, 2016. A year later, Kardashian announced her own pregnancy. Unfortunately, as the entire world learned in April 2018, just days before Kardashian gave birth to her daughter, True, Thompson isn\u2019t exactly the settling down type. Days before the birth of their first child together, Thompson was caught on video cheating on Kardashian with a slew of women. Video from Oct. 2017 was also released that proved that Thompson had probably never been faithful to the mother of his daughter.\n\nKhloe Kardashian, Tristan Thompson and their mothers | Instagram via Tristan Thompson Khloe Kardashian, Tristan Thompson and their mothers | Instagram via Tristan Thompson\n\nNo comparison\n\nFor the sake of their daughter, it looks like Kardashian and Thompson are determined to work things out. Whatever her other reasons for staying with the Cavaliers star, money certainly isn\u2019t one of the deciding factors. With her salary from her long-running series, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, her clothing line, Good American, and a slew of other ventures, according to People, Kardashian is worth about $40 million.\n\nBy comparison, Thompson\u2019s net worth sits at around $8 million. According to Go Banking Rates, he is currently in the midst of a five-year, $82 million contract with the Cavaliers, that takes him through the 2019-2020 season. Thompson was luckily enough to win a championship ring in 2016. However, with LeBron James now with the Los Angeles Lakers, we\u2019re not sure that Thomson will be seeing another golden statue anytime soon.\n\nThough Kardashian has had to relive her boyfriend\u2019s indiscretions on Keeping Up With the Kardashians, it seems like she\u2019s well on her way to forgiving him. Only time will tell if her fans will ever think Thompson is worthy of her again.\n\nRead more: The Real Reason Why Khloe Kardashian Forgave Tristan Thompson"}
{"label": true, "txt": "Stassi Schroeder has admittedly dated a lot of duds. Just on her time on Vanderpump Rules, she\u2019s taken up relationships with Jax Taylor, which ended well for no one; that bartender Frank who wanted to fight Jax; and broadcaster Patrick Meagher, who clearly thought he was way too good to be on a reality show. Now, Stassi is dating Beau Clark, and it seems like these two are really meant to be. Beau from Vanderpump Rules also has a normal job \u2014 he\u2019s not a SURver or bartender or actor, which means that he\u2019s removed from much of the SUR drama. Hey, maybe these two really could work.\n\nBeau and Stassi met when Stassi finally let her friends \u2014 fellow Vanderpump castmates Kristen Doute and Katie Maloney-Schwartz \u2014 set her up with him. Of their relationship, Stassi told Entertainment Tonight, \"I can just be myself [with him]. Legitimately, I feel so comfortable and happy and I just have fun and he just, literally, just I love him for him and he loves me for me,\" she said. \"I just want to be around him all the time. And I've really never had that, which is kinda sad, I guess. But, I have it now.\"\n\nEveryone deserves that feeling, so it's wonderful now that Stassi has it. She also told Entertainment Tonight that they had to have the \"I'm on a reality show\" talk very early in their relationship. Stassi said that when they first started dating, Beau was all, \"No, I have a normal career.\" Eventually, though, Beau agreed to film with her, and ended up even enjoying it. \"He loves it, and he's best friends with all my best friends, and it's not even that they're my best friends now, they're our best friends,\" Stassi continue.\n\nBeau's day job, by the way, is that of a commercial casting and advertising associate, according to E! News. That means that he helps fill commercials with people so that companies can sell things to other people. A search on LinkedIn doesn't turn up any leads, so maybe he doesn't have one, or he doesn't go by \"Beau Clark\" on it. No matter, though \u2014 Beau is in a place where he doesn't need Vanderpump Rules because he has an actual career. That's better in the long run, because it alleviates any doubt that he's with for Stassi for fame (or infamy).

But recently, when the network hired Rodriguez without his input, he was not happy and felt threatened by the move.\n\nWe\u2019re so excited to announce that @michaelstrahan and @sarahaines will be co-hosts of #GMADay \u2013 our new third hour, premiering Sept. 10 at 1pm ET / 12pm C/P! https://t.co/W5KClVZvJP pic.twitter.com/z9GkaM5irv \u2014 Good Morning America (@GMA) July 23, 2018\n\nInstead of battling Rodriguez for airtime \u2013 or being worried about the former baseball player taking his place \u2013 Strahan made the move to the spinoff, and his future co-host is excited about the new show.\n\nOn Instagram, Haines wrote that she couldn\u2019t find the words to adequately express her excitement about sitting next to Strahan on this new journey. She added that it has been a dream of hers for a long time, but it is bittersweet to leave The View.\n\nGMA Day will premiere on Monday, September 10th, and air at 1 p.m. in the east and noon in the central and pacific time zones. It will be replacing The Chew, which ABC canceled after the sexual misconduct and rape allegations against star chef Mario Batali.\n\nAs for Rodriguez, Good Morning America has been giving him a ton of airtime, and insiders say it feels like he is starting to overshadow the six-foot-five Strahan. The sources add that A-Rod\u2019s goal is to overtake Strahan as television\u2019s \u201ctop jock.\u201d In addition to his gig on GMA, Rodriguez is also the lead MLB analyst for FOX Sports, and he has been a guest judge on Shark Tank.\n\nAfter his steroid scandal in 2014, Rodriguez has been attempting to rebuild his image. He comes across as quite the train wreck compared to the squeaky-clean Strahan. But ABC is willing to take the gamble, and Rodriguez will reportedly climb over anyone to achieve his goal.\n\nHis high-profile relationship with Jennifer Lopez also helps.\n\nInsiders say that both Strahan and Rodriguez have \u201cmassive egos,\u201d and Rodriguez joining GMA has caused Strahan to get jealous.\n\nBut, as Radar Online reports, Strahan is no stranger to how cutthroat TV can be. He shocked Ripa when he told her he was leaving her show for GMA just minutes before they went on the air.\n\nHowever, insiders say that Strahan doesn\u2019t believe Rodriguez deserves another chance, and he can\u2019t believe his image renovation.\n\nIf there is any truth to the rumors that Strahan feels threatened by Rodriguez, though, many fans find it hard to believe. In addition to GMA, Strahan is also the host of the $100,000 Pyramid, and he co-hosts FOXs NFL pregame show during football season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt seems like we will get multiple opportunities to see both Alex Rodriguez and Michael Strahan on television in the future."}

And although the show has since been canceled, Mama June, 37, (her real name is June Shannon) has continued to draw attention on social media, where she's been praised for her dramatic weight-loss success.\n\nAs Entertainment Tonight reports, Mama June started her weight-loss journey at 460 pounds, and her new WEtv show Mama June: From Not to Hot, which debuts tomorrow\u2014teases that she's now a size 4.\n\nYou May Also Like: How This Woman Lost 75 Pounds and 6 Dress Sizes\n\n\n\nAfter gastric bypass surgery, Mama June underwent another surgery to remove the excess skin that was left behind after the weight was gone. Then, as her 17-year-old daughter, Pumpkin, tells ET, she \"got her boobies done. She got them from a 44 long to 36 up.\"\n\n\"I think that her biggest thing [she has to] overcome is that fact that she still thinks of herself as a bigger person, because, even to this day, like, a couple of days ago we had a conversation, and...she looked in the mirror and was like, 'I'm still fat.' And I guess because she's seen herself as a bigger person all these years, she doesn't realize how small she is.\"\n\nMama June's trainer on the show, Kenya Crooks, also weighed in: \"That's what she's used to doing, and when you're a bigger person, that's how you disguise all of that\u2014through wearing bigger clothes. So, now, we're having to transform her mind even more so...because she has curves now, she looks awesome.\"\n\nPictures of Mama June's makeover have yet to surface\u2014our bet is that the big reveal will happen on the show\u2014but we're keeping our eyes peeled and will update this post as soon we have them. WEtv has referred to her weight loss as \"the most shocking transformation in reality TV history.\"\n\n**UPDATE January 25, 2017\n\nBack in August, 2016 (as originally reported on below), Mama June was denied surgery to remove her excess skin that remained after extreme weight loss because she hadn't lost enough weight (even after losing 150 pounds in one year) to become a candidate. Determined to shed the remaining 75 pounds and prep her body for the surgery, the reality TV star has been documenting her diet and fitness journey, which will air in a new show called Mama June: From Not to Hot.\n\nDebuting February 24 on WEtv, the \"docu-dramedy,\" as it's being called, will include seven one-hour episodes that spotlight Mama June's incredibly emotional and physical transformation, as well as her intensive plastic surgery procedures to finally remove her excess skin and reveal a whole new look.\n\n\n\nIn a sneak peek of the upcoming show, exclusive to People, Mama June said, \u201cAfter the weight-loss surgery, I\u2019m going to look completely different. I\u2019m scared, too. When I\u2019m done, I\u2019m not even going to recognize my own self in the mirror.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Originally Published August 4, 2016\n\nAfter massive weight loss, there's typically a lot of excess skin left behind that doctors can remove with surgery, which is what Mama June (currently 245 pounds) had expected to undergo. This week, she appeared on the season finale of the E! reality show Botched, where she revealed issues with the C-section she had when she gave birth to her daughter Alanna (aka Honey Boo Boo) 10 years ago. The doctor cut too deep and left her with an incredible amount of scar tissue on her abdomen that can only be removed with surgery.\n\nYou May Also Like: The Doctors of Botched Are Back to Do Surgery Like You\u2019ve Never Seen Before\n\nThe combination of extreme weight loss and a flubbed C-section surgery have left Mama June desperate to fix her figure flaws. But just when she thought the time had come, her surgeon, Terry Dubrow, delivered some bad news. Her BMI (Body Mass Index; an indirect measure of body fat) was still too high, 39 to be exact, and she needs to be closer to a 28 in order for the body-contouring procedure to be successful. This means she needs to lose about 75 more pounds.\n\nImages/Getty\n\nBut what is the reasoning behind this, and is BMI really that critical in this case? We turned to San Diego plastic surgeon Joseph L. Grzeskiewicz, MD, for the answer. \"Like most other doctors, I have some criteria that I use to determine candidacy for removal of excess tissue after weight loss. One of the most important criteria is that I would like to see a sufficient amount of time with a stable weight\u2014preferably a year. That does not mean the time since weight loss commenced, or the time that the patient first hit their target weight, but rather it is a year of remaining at the same stable weight that is healthy and appropriate for their age and height. The next criterion I use is the BMI. I consider a BMI of 26\u201328 to be the upper limit of the safe range for body contouring surgery, but I don\u2019t like to rely on this as a hard fast rule because there are borderline cases (for example, bodybuilders with larger muscle mass and denser bone structure).\"\n\nAnother thing Dr. Grezeskiewicz says is important to note if you're considering this procedure: your medical history. \"Being in good health is crucial (any issues like cardiovascular problems or diabetes need to be under control), and I will never do this type of surgery on a smoker or someone who uses nicotine in any form because it can cause serious healing problems and tissue loss.\"\n\nYou May Also Like: New Study Says BMI is Inaccurate Way to Measure Health\n\nIf a surgery like this is performed on someone who is still too heavy or not in good health, there can be scary repercussions. According to Dr. Grzeskiewicz, the biggest and most serious consequences are medical complications, some of which can lead to severe problems or even death. \"Issues like blood clots in veins that can travel to the lungs (pulmonary emboli), heart attacks, kidney failure, strokes, wound-healing problems and tissue loss are all possible complications in people who are poor candidates for this kind of surgery. In addition, if a person is a diabetic with poor control, the infection risk is significantly elevated.\"\n\nAesthetic issues are also much more prone to happen in someone who is too heavy still for surgery. \"Contour irregularity, unevenness of form, asymmetry and irregular, thick or poorly positioned scars are all things that happen more frequently when this is the case, and they can lead to the need for further surgery,\" says Dr. Grzeskiewicz.\n\nThrough thorough consultation and testing, doctors can safely perform these body-contouring surgeries and continue to transform lives. \"The patients who undergo this type of surgery after massive weight loss are some of our happiest patients,\" says Dr. Grzeskiewicz. We hope Mama June reaches her goal!"}

{"label": true, "txt": "Buffy the Vampire Slayer is an American supernatural drama television series based on the 1992 film of the same name. It was created by Joss Whedon under his production tag, Mutant Enemy Productions, with later co-executive producers being Jane Espenson, David Fury, David Greenwalt, Doug Petrie, Marti Noxon, and David Solomon.\n\nThe series premiered on March 10, 1997, on The WB and concluded on May 20, 2003, on UPN. The series narrative follows Buffy Summers (played by Sarah Michelle Gellar), the latest in a line of young women known as \"Vampire Slayers\", or simply \"Slayers\". In the story, Slayers or the 'Chosen Ones' are \"called\" (chosen by fate) to battle against vampires, demons, and other forces of darkness. Being a young woman, Buffy wants to live a normal life, but as the series progresses, she learns to embrace her destiny. Like previous Slayers, Buffy is aided by a Watcher, who guides, teaches, and trains her. Unlike her predecessors, Buffy surrounds herself with a circle of loyal friends who become known as the \"Scooby Gang\".\n\nThe series received critical and popular acclaim, frequently being listed as one of the greatest TV shows of all-time,[7] and usually reached between four and six million viewers on original airings.[8] Although such ratings are lower than successful shows on the \"big four\" networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox),[9] they were a success for the relatively new and smaller WB Television Network.[10]\n\nThe success of Buffy has led to hundreds of tie-in products, including novels, comics, and video games. The series has received attention in fandom (including fan films), parody, and academia, and has influenced the direction of other television series.[4][11] The series, as well as its spinoff series Angel, and extensions thereof, have been collectively termed the \"Buffyverse\". As of 2018, a reboot of the series is being developed for television, with Monica Owusu-Breen as showrunner.[12]\n\nPremise [ edit ]\n\nCharacters [ edit ]\n\nBuffy Summers (played by Sarah Michelle Gellar) is the \"Slayer\", one in a long line of young women chosen by fate to battle evil forces. This mystical calling endows her with powers that dramatically increase physical strength, endurance, agility, accelerated healing, intuition, and a limited degree of clairvoyance, usually in the form of prophetic dreams. She has returned from death twice and is known as a reluctant hero who wants to live a normal life. However, she learns to embrace her destiny as the vampire slayer.[13][14]\n\nBuffy receives guidance from her Watcher, Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart Head). Giles, rarely referred to by his first name (it is later revealed that in his misspent younger days he went by \"Ripper\"), is a member of the Watchers' Council, whose job is to train and guide the Slayers. Giles researches the supernatural creatures that Buffy must face, offers insights into their origins and advice on how to defeat them, and helps her stay in fighting form.\n\nBuffy is also helped by friends she meets at Sunnydale High: Willow Rosenberg (Alyson Hannigan) and Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon). Willow is originally a wallflower who excels at academics, providing a contrast to Buffy's outgoing personality and less-than-stellar educational record. They share the social isolation that comes with being different, and especially from being exceptional young women. As the series progresses, Willow becomes a more assertive character and a powerful witch, and comes out as a lesbian. In contrast, Xander, with no supernatural skills but very athletic, provides comic relief and a grounded perspective. It is Xander who often provides the heart to the series, and in season six, becomes the hero in place of Buffy who defeats the \"Big Bad.\" Buffy and Willow are the only characters who appear in all 144 episodes; Xander is missing in only one.\n\nThe cast of characters grew over the course of the series. Buffy first arrives in Sunnydale with her mother, Joyce Summers (portrayed by Kristine Sutherland), who functions as an anchor of normality in the Summers' lives even after she learns of Buffy's role in the supernatural world (\"Becoming, Part Two\"). Buffy's younger sister Dawn Summers (Michelle Trachtenberg) is introduced in season five (\"Buffy vs. Dracula\"). A vampire tortured with a soul in return for horrific deeds committed in the past to many, including a young gypsy girl and her family, Angel (portrayed by David Boreanaz), is Buffy's love interest throughout the first three seasons. He leaves Buffy as he believes he isn't good enough for her. He goes on to make amends for his sins and to search for redemption in his own spin-off, Angel. He makes several guest appearances in the remaining seasons, including the last episode.\n\nAt Sunnydale High, Buffy meets several other students besides Willow and Xander willing to join her fight for good, an informal group eventually tagged the \"Scooby Gang\" or \"Scoobies.\" Cordelia Chase (Charisma Carpenter), the archetypal shallow cheerleader, reluctantly becomes involved. Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne (Seth Green), a fellow student, rock guitarist and werewolf, joins the group through his relationship with Willow. Jenny Calendar (Robia LaMorte), Sunnydale's computer science teacher, joins the group after helping destroy a demon trapped in cyberspace during season 1. She later becomes Giles' love interest. Anya (Emma Caulfield), a former vengeance demon (Anyanka) who specialized in avenging scorned women, becomes Xander's lover after losing her powers and joins the group in season four.\n\nIn Buffy's senior year at high school, she meets Faith (Eliza Dushku), the other current Slayer, who was \"called\" forth when Slayer Kendra Young (Bianca Lawson) was killed by vampire Drusilla (Juliet Landau), in season two. Although Faith initially fights on the side of good with Buffy and the rest of the group, she comes to stand against them and sides with Mayor Richard Wilkins (Harry Groener) after accidentally killing a human in season three. She reappears briefly in the fourth season, looking for vengeance, and moves to Angel where she voluntarily goes to jail for her murders. Faith reappears in season seven of Buffy, after having helped Angel and his crew, and fights alongside Buffy against The First Evil.\n\nBuffy gathers other allies: Spike (James Marsters), a vampire, is an old companion of Angelus (Angel) and one of Buffy's major enemies in early seasons, although they later become allies and lovers. At the end of season six, Spike regains his soul. Spike is known for his Billy Idol-style peroxide blond hair and his black leather coat, stolen from a previous Slayer, Nikki Wood; her son, Robin Wood (D. B. Woodside), joined the group in the final season. Tara Maclay (Amber Benson) is a fellow member of Willow's Wicca group during season four, and their friendship eventually turns into a romantic relationship. Buffy becomes involved personally and professionally with Riley Finn (Marc Blucas), a military operative in \"the Initiative,\" which hunts demons using science and technology. The final season sees geeky wannabe-villain Andrew Wells (Tom Lenk) come to side with the Scoobies after initially being their captive/hostage; they regard him more as a nuisance than an ally.\n\nBuffy featured dozens of recurring characters, both major and minor. For example, the \"Big Bad\" (villain) characters were featured for at least one season (for example, Glory is a character who appeared in 12 episodes, spanning much of season five). Similarly, characters who allied themselves to the group and characters who attended the same institutions were sometimes featured in multiple episodes.\n\nSetting and filming locations [ edit ]\n\nThe show is set in the fictional California town of Sunnydale, whose suburban Sunnydale High School sits on top of a \"Hellmouth\", a gateway to demon realms. The Hellmouth, located beneath the school library, is a source of mystical energies as well as a nexus for a wide variety of evil creatures and supernatural phenomena. In addition to being an open-ended plot device, Joss Whedon has cited the Hellmouth and \"High school as Hell\" as one of the primary metaphors in creating the series.[15]\n\nMost of Buffy was shot on location in Los Angeles, California. The high school used in the first three seasons is actually Torrance High School, in Torrance, California, the same high school used for Beverly Hills, 90210.[16] The show was initially very dependent on location shooting, because the production budget allowed for few permanent sets to be built.[17] In Season One this was limited to the interior of Sunnydale High (the library, hallways and classrooms), Buffy's bedroom, and the Master's underground lair. From Season Two more permanent sets were built, including the full interior of Buffy's house, Angel's mansion, Giles' apartment, and extensions to the high school set (the addition of a dining hall and commons area).[17] A driveway area near the gated entrance to Fox Studios was transformed into a graveyard.[17] In Season Three the Sunnydale \"Main Street\" was constructed on the backlot, which would be a staple location for the rest of the series.[18] When the show transitioned to college in the fourth season, the hallway sets from Sunnydale High were remodeled to appear as the interior hallways of UC Sunnydale.[19]\n\nSome of the exterior shots of the college Buffy attends, UC Sunnydale, were filmed at UCLA. Several episodes include shots from the Oviatt Library at CSUN.[20][21] The exterior of the mansion where Angelus, Spike, and Drusilla lived was Frank Lloyd Wright's Ennis House.[22]\n\nFormat [ edit ]\n\nBuffy is told in a serialized format, with each episode involving a self-contained story while contributing to a larger storyline,[23] which is broken down into season-long narratives marked by the rise and defeat of a powerful antagonist, commonly referred to as the \"Big Bad\". While the show is mainly a drama with frequent comic relief, most episodes blend different genres, including horror, martial arts, romance, melodrama, farce, science fiction, comedy, and even, in one episode, musical comedy.\n\nThe series' narrative revolves around Buffy and her friends, collectively dubbed the \"Scooby Gang,\" who struggle to balance the fight against supernatural evils with their complex social lives.[23] The show mixes complex, season-long storylines with a villain-of-the-week format; a typical episode contains one or more villains, or supernatural phenomena, that are thwarted or defeated by the end of the episode. Though elements and relationships are explored and ongoing subplots are included, the show focuses primarily on Buffy and her role as an archetypal heroine. Gellar described the show as \"the ultimate metaphor: horrors of adolescence manifesting through these actual monsters. It's the hardest time of life.\"[24]\n\nIn the first few seasons, the most prominent monsters in the Buffy bestiary are vampires, which are based on traditional myths, lore, and literary conventions. As the series continues, Buffy and her companions fight an increasing variety of demons, as well as ghosts, werewolves, zombies, and unscrupulous humans. They frequently save the world from annihilation by a combination of physical combat, magic, and detective-style investigation, and are guided by an extensive collection of ancient and mystical reference books.\n\nStorylines [ edit ]\n\nSeason one exemplifies the \"high school is hell\" concept. Buffy Summers has just moved to Sunnydale after burning down her old school's gym, and hopes to escape her Slayer duties. Her plans are complicated by Rupert Giles, her new Watcher, who reminds her of the inescapable presence of evil. Sunnydale High is built atop a Hellmouth, a portal to demon dimensions that attracts supernatural phenomena to the area. Buffy befriends two schoolmates, Xander Harris and Willow Rosenberg, who help her fight evil throughout the series, but they must first prevent The Master, an ancient and especially threatening vampire, from opening the Hellmouth and taking over Sunnydale.\n\nThe emotional stakes are raised in season two. Vampires Spike and Drusilla (weakened from a mob in Prague, which, it is implied, caused her debilitating injury), come to town along with a new slayer, Kendra Young, who was activated as a result of Buffy's brief death in the season one finale. Xander becomes involved with Cordelia, while Willow becomes involved with witchcraft and Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne, who is a werewolf. The romantic relationship between Buffy and the vampire Angel develops over the course of the season, but after they have sex, Angel's soul, given to him by a Gypsy curse in the past, is lost, and he once more becomes Angelus, a sadistic killer. Kendra is killed by a restored Drusilla. Angelus torments much of the \"Scooby Gang\" throughout the rest of the season and murders multiple innocents and Giles' new girlfriend Jenny Calendar, a gypsy who was sent to maintain Angel's curse. To avert an apocalypse, Buffy is forced to banish Angelus to a demon dimension just moments after Willow has restored his soul. The ordeal leaves Buffy emotionally shattered, and she leaves Sunnydale.\n\nAfter attempting to start a new life in Los Angeles, Buffy returns to town in season three. Angel has mysteriously been released from the demon dimension, but is close to insanity due to the torment he suffered there, and is nearly driven to suicide by the First Evil. He and Buffy realize that a relationship between them can never happen; he eventually leaves Sunnydale at the end of the season. A new watcher named Wesley is put in Giles' place when Giles is fired from the Watcher's Council because he has developed a \"father's love\" for Buffy; and towards the end of the season, Buffy announces that she will no longer be working for the Council. Early in the season, she meets Faith, the Slayer activated after Kendra's death. She also encounters the affable Mayor Richard Wilkins, who secretly has plans to \"ascend\" (become a \"pure\" demon) on Sunnydale High's Graduation Day. Although Faith initially works well with Buffy, she becomes increasingly unstable after accidentally killing a human and forms a relationship with the paternal yet manipulative Mayor, eventually landing in a coma after a fight with Buffy. At the end of the season, after the Mayor becomes a huge snake-like demon, Buffy and the entire graduating class destroy him by blowing up Sunnydale High.\n\nSeason four sees Buffy and Willow enroll at UC Sunnydale, while Xander joins the workforce and begins dating Anya, a former vengeance demon. Spike returns as a series regular and is abducted by The Initiative, a top-secret military installation based beneath the UC Sunnydale campus. They implant a microchip in his head that punishes him whenever he tries to harm a human. He makes a truce with the Scooby Gang and begins to fight on their side, purely for the joy of fighting, upon learning that he can still harm other demons. Oz leaves town after realizing that he is too dangerous as a werewolf, and Willow falls in love with Tara Maclay, another witch. Buffy begins dating Riley Finn, a graduate student and member of The Initiative. Although appearing to be a well-meaning anti-demon operation, The Initiative's sinister plans are revealed when Adam, a monster secretly built from parts of humans, demons and machinery, escapes and begins to wreak havoc on the town. Adam is destroyed by a magical composite of Buffy and her three friends, and The Initiative is shut down.\n\nDuring season five, a younger sister, Dawn, suddenly appears in Buffy's life; although she is new to the series, to the characters it is as if she has always been there. Buffy is confronted by Glory, an exiled Hell God who is searching for a \"Key\" that will allow her to return to her Hell dimension and in the process blur the lines between dimensions and unleash Hell on Earth. It is later discovered that the Key's protectors have turned the Key into human form \u2013 Dawn \u2013 concurrently implanting everybody with lifelong memories of her. The Watcher's Council aids in Buffy's research on Glory, and she and Giles are both reinstated on their own terms. Riley leaves early in the season after realizing that Buffy does not love him and joins a military demon-hunting operation. Spike, still implanted with the Initiative chip, realizes he is in love with Buffy and increasingly helps the Scoobies in their fight. Buffy's mother Joyce dies of a brain aneurysm, while at the end of the season, Xander proposes to Anya. Glory finally discovers that Dawn is the key and kidnaps her. To save Dawn, Buffy sacrifices her own life by diving into the portal to the Hell dimension and thus closes it with her death.\n\nAt the beginning of season six, Buffy has been dead for 147 days, but Buffy's friends resurrect her through a powerful spell, believing they have rescued her from a Hell dimension. Buffy returns in a deep depression, explaining (several episodes later) that she had been in Heaven and is devastated to be pulled back to Earth. Giles returns to England because he has concluded that Buffy has become too reliant on him, while Buffy takes up a fast-food job to support herself and Dawn, and develops a secret, mutually abusive relationship with Spike. Dawn suffers from kleptomania and feelings of alienation, Xander leaves Anya at the altar (after which she once again becomes a vengeance demon), and Willow becomes addicted to magic, causing Tara to temporarily leave her. They also begin to deal with The Trio, a group of nerds led by Warren Mears who use their proficiency in technology and magic to attempt to kill Buffy and take over Sunnydale. Warren is shown to be the only competent villain of the group and, after Buffy thwarts his plans multiple times and the Trio breaks apart, he becomes unhinged and attacks Buffy with a gun, accidentally killing Tara in the process. This causes Willow to descend into a nihilistic darkness and unleash all of her dark magical powers, killing Warren and attempting to kill his friends. Giles returns to face her in battle and infuses her with light magic, tapping into her remaining humanity. This overwhelms Willow with guilt and pain, whereupon she attempts to destroy the world to end everyone's suffering, although it eventually allows Xander to reach through her pain and end her rampage. Late in the season, after losing control and trying to rape Buffy, Spike leaves Sunnydale and travels to see a demon and asks him to \"return him to what he used to be\" so that he can \"give Buffy what she deserves.\" After Spike passes a series of brutal tests, the demon restores his soul.\n\nDuring season seven, it is revealed that Buffy's second resurrection caused an instability that is allowing the First Evil to begin tipping the balance between good and evil. It begins by hunting down and killing inactive Potential Slayers, and soon raises an army of ancient, powerful Turok-Han vampires. After the Watchers' Council is destroyed, a number of Potential Slayers (some brought by Giles) take refuge in Buffy's house. Faith returns to help fight The First Evil, and the new Sunnydale High School's principal, Robin Wood, also joins the cause. The Turok-Han vampires and a sinister, misogynistic preacher known as Caleb begin causing havoc for the Scoobies. As the Hellmouth becomes more active, nearly all of Sunnydale's population \u2013 humans and demons alike \u2013 flee. In the series finale, Buffy kills Caleb, and Angel returns to Sunnydale with an amulet, which Buffy gives to Spike; the Scoobies then surround the Hellmouth and the Potential Slayers descend into its cavern, while Willow casts a spell that activates their Slayer powers. Anya dies in the fight, as do some of the new Slayers. Spike's amulet channels the power of the sun to destroy the Hellmouth and all the vampires within it, including himself. The collapse of the cavern creates a crater that swallows all of Sunnydale, while the survivors of the battle escape in a school bus. In the final scene, as the survivors survey the crater, Dawn asks, \"What are we going to do now?\" Buffy slowly begins to enigmatically smile as she contemplates the future ahead of her, ending the series on a hopeful note.\n\nProduction [ edit ]\n\nOrigins [ edit ]\n\nBuffy creator Joss Whedon also served as executive producer, head writer, and director on the series. creator Joss Whedon also served as executive producer, head writer, and director on the series.\n\nWriter Joss Whedon says that \"Rhonda the Immortal Waitress\" was really the first incarnation of the Buffy concept, \"the idea of some woman who seems to be completely insignificant who turns out to be extraordinary.\"[25] This early, unproduced idea evolved into Buffy, which Whedon developed to invert the Hollywood formula of \"the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror movie.\"[26] Whedon wanted \"to subvert that idea and create someone who was a hero.\"[26] He explained, \"The very first mission statement of the show was the joy of female power: having it, using it, sharing it.\"[27]\n\nThe idea was first visited through Whedon's script for the 1992 movie Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which featured Kristy Swanson in the title role. The director, Fran Rubel Kuzui, saw it as a \"pop culture comedy about what people think about vampires.\"[28][29] Whedon disagreed: \"I had written this scary film about an empowered woman, and they turned it into a broad comedy. It was crushing.\"[30] The script was praised within the industry,[31] but the movie was not.[32]\n\nSeveral years later, Gail Berman (later a Fox executive, but at that time President and CEO of the production company Sandollar Television, who owned the TV rights to the movie) approached Whedon to develop his Buffy concept into a television series.[33] Whedon explained that \"They said, 'Do you want to do a show?' And I thought, 'High school as a horror movie.' And so the metaphor became the central concept behind Buffy, and that's how I sold it.\"[34] The supernatural elements in the series stood as metaphors for personal anxieties associated with adolescence and young adulthood.[23] Early in its development, the series was going to be simply titled Slayer.[35] Whedon went on to write and partly fund a 25-minute non-broadcast pilot[36] that was shown to networks and eventually sold to the WB Network. The latter promoted the premiere with a series of History of the Slayer clips,[37] and the first episode aired on March 10, 1997. Whedon has declared in June 2003 that the non-broadcast pilot would not be included with DVDs of the series \"while there is strength in these bones,\" stating that it \"sucks on ass.\"[38]\n\nExecutive producers [ edit ]\n\nJoss Whedon was credited as executive producer throughout the run of the series, and for the first five seasons (1997\u20132001) he was also the showrunner, supervising the writing and all aspects of production. Marti Noxon took on the role for seasons six and seven (2001\u20132003), but Whedon continued to be involved with writing and directing Buffy alongside projects such as Angel, Fray, and Firefly. Fran Rubel Kuzui and her husband, Kaz Kuzui, were credited as executive producers[39] but were not involved in the show. Their credit, rights, and royalties over the franchise relate to their funding, producing, and directing of the original movie version of Buffy.[40]\n\nWriting [ edit ]\n\nScript-writing was done by Mutant Enemy, a production company created by Whedon in 1997. The writers with the most writing credits[41] are Joss Whedon, Steven S. DeKnight, Jane Espenson, David Fury, Drew Goddard, Drew Greenberg, David Greenwalt, Rebecca Rand Kirshner, Marti Noxon and Doug Petrie. Other authors with writing credits include Dean Batali, Carl Ellsworth, Tracey Forbes, Ashley Gable, Howard Gordon, Diego Gutierrez, Elin Hampton, Rob Des Hotel, Matt Kiene, Ty King, Thomas A. Swyden, Joe Reinkemeyer, Dana Reston and Dan Vebber.[42]\n\nJane Espenson has explained how scripts came together.[43] First, the writers talked about the emotional issues facing Buffy Summers and how she would confront them through her battle against evil supernatural forces. Then the episode's story was \"broken\" into acts and scenes. Act breaks were designed as key moments to intrigue viewers so that they would stay with the episode following the commercial break. The writers collectively filled in scenes surrounding these act breaks for a more fleshed-out story. A whiteboard marked their progress by mapping brief descriptions of each scene. Once \"breaking\" was done, the credited author wrote an outline for the episode, which was checked by Whedon or Noxon. The writer then wrote a full script, which went through a series of drafts, and finally a quick rewrite from the show runner. The final article was used as the shooting script.\n\nBroadcast history and syndication [ edit ]\n\nUPN took great advantage promoting the network switch by teasing fans of Buffy's resurrection from The WB's series finale.\n\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer first aired on March 10, 1997, (as a mid season replacement for the show Savannah) on the WB network, and played a key role in the growth of the Warner Bros. television network in its early years.[44][45] After five seasons, it transferred to the United Paramount Network (UPN) for its final two seasons. In 2001, the show went into syndication in the United States on local stations and on cable channel FX; the local airings ended in 2005, and the FX airings lasted until 2008 but returned to the network in 2013. Beginning in January 2010, it began to air in syndication in the United States on Logo.[46] Reruns also briefly aired on MTV. In March 2010, it began to air in Canada on MuchMusic and MuchMore.[47] On November 7, 2010, it began airing on Chiller with a 24-hour marathon; the series airs weekdays. Chiller also aired a 14-hour Thanksgiving Day marathon on November 25, 2010.[48] In 2011, it began airing on Oxygen and TeenNick. On June 22, 2015, it began airing on ABC Family.\n\nWhile the seventh season was still being broadcast, Sarah Michelle Gellar told Entertainment Weekly she was not going to sign on for an eighth year; \"When we started to have such a strong year this year, I thought: 'This is how I want to go out, on top, at our best.'\"[49] Whedon and UPN gave some considerations to production of a spin-off series that would not require Gellar, including a rumored Faith series, but nothing came of those plans.[50] The Buffy canon continued outside the television medium in the Dark Horse Comics series, Buffy Season Eight. This was produced starting March 2007 by Whedon, who also wrote the first story arc, \"The Long Way Home\".[51]\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the entire series aired on Sky One and BBC Two. After protests from fans about early episodes being edited for their pre-watershed time-slot, from the second run (mid-second season onwards), the BBC gave the show two time slots: the early-evening slot (typically Thursday at 6:45 pm) for a family-friendly version with violence, objectionable language and other stronger material cut out, and a late-night uncut version (initially late-night Sundays, but for most of the run, late-night Fridays; exact times varied).[52] Sky1 aired the show typically at 8:00 pm on Thursdays. From the fourth season onwards, the BBC aired the show in anamorphic 16:9 widescreen format. Whedon later said that Buffy was never intended to be viewed this way.[53] Despite his claims, Syfy now airs repeat showings in the widescreen format.\n\nIn August 2014, Pivot announced that, for the first time, episodes of Buffy would be broadcast in high-definition and in a widescreen 16:9 format authorized by the studio, but not by any of the series' principals.[54] The transfer was poorly received by some fans, owing to a number of technical and format changes that were viewed as detrimental to the show's presentation; various scenes were heavily cropped to fit the 16:9 format, and shots were altered to have a brighter look, often with color levels altered. Other problems included missing filters, editing errors, and poorly re-rendered CGI.[55] Series creator Joss Whedon and other members of the original team also expressed their displeasure.[56]\n\nMusic [ edit ]\n\nBuffy features a mix of original, indie, rock and pop music. The composers spent around seven days scoring between fourteen and thirty minutes of music for each episode.[57] Christophe Beck revealed that the Buffy composers used computers and synthesizers and were limited to recording one or two \"real\" samples. Despite this, their goal was to produce \"dramatic\" orchestration that would stand up to film scores.[57]\n\nAlongside the score, most episodes featured indie rock music, usually at the characters' venue of choice, The Bronze. Buffy music supervisor John King explained that \"we like to use unsigned bands\" that \"you would believe would play in this place.\"[57] For example, the fictional group Dingoes Ate My Baby were portrayed on screen by front group Four Star Mary.[58] Pop songs by famous artists were rarely featured prominently, but several episodes spotlighted the sounds of more famous artists such as Sarah McLachlan,[59][60] The Brian Jonestown Massacre, Blink-182,[61] Third Eye Blind,[62] Aimee Mann[63] (who also had a line of dialogue), The Dandy Warhols,[64] Cibo Matto,[65] Coldplay, Lisa Loeb, K's Choice and Michelle Branch.[66] The popularity of music used in Buffy has led to the release of four soundtrack albums: Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Album,[67] Radio Sunnydale,[68] the \"Once More, with Feeling\" Soundtrack,[69][70][71] and Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Score.\n\nEpisode list [ edit ]\n\nSeason Episodes Originally aired First aired Last aired Network 1 12 March 10, 1997 ( ) June 2, 1997 ( 1997-06-02 ) The WB 2 22 September 15, 1997 ( ) May 19, 1998 ( 1998-05-19 ) 3 22 September 29, 1998 ( ) September 21, 1999 ( 1999-09-21 ) 4 22 October 5, 1999 ( ) May 23, 2000 ( 2000-05-23 ) 5 22 September 26, 2000 ( ) May 22, 2001 ( 2001-05-22 ) 6 22 October 2, 2001 ( ) May 21, 2002 ( 2002-05-21 ) UPN 7 22 September 24, 2002 ( ) May 20, 2003 ( 2003-05-20 )\n\nInspirations and metaphors [ edit ]\n\nDuring the first year of the series, Whedon described the show as My So-Called Life meets The X-Files.\"[72] My So-Called Life gave a sympathetic portrayal of teen anxieties; in contrast, The X-Files delivered a supernatural \"monster of the week\" storyline. Alongside these series, Whedon has cited cult film Night of the Comet as a \"big influence,\"[73] and credited the X-Men character Kitty Pryde as a significant influence on the character of Buffy.[74] The authors of the unofficial guidebook Dusted point out that the series was often a pastiche, borrowing elements from previous horror novels, movies, and short stories and from such common literary stock as folklore and mythology.[75] Nevitt and Smith describe Buffy's use of pastiche as \"post modern Gothic.\"[76] For example, the Adam character parallels the Frankenstein monster, the episode \"Bad Eggs\" parallels Invasion of the Body Snatchers, \"Out of Mind, Out of Sight\" parallels The Invisible Man, and so on.\n\nBuffy episodes often include a deeper meaning or metaphor as well. Whedon explained, \"We think very carefully about what we're trying to say emotionally, politically, and even philosophically while we're writing it... it really is, apart from being a pop-culture phenomenon, something that is deeply layered textually episode by episode.\"[77] Academics Wilcox and Lavery provide examples of how a few episodes deal with real life issues turned into supernatural metaphors:\n\nIn the world of Buffy the problems that teenagers face become literal monsters. A mother can take over her daughter's life (\"Witch\"); a strict stepfather-to-be really is a heartless machine (\"Ted\"); a young lesbian fears that her nature is demonic (\"Goodbye Iowa\" and \"Family\"); a girl who has sex with even the nicest-seeming guy may discover that he afterwards becomes a monster (\"Innocence\").[23]\n\nThe love affair between the vampire Angel and Buffy was fraught with metaphors. For example, their night of passion cost the vampire his soul. Sarah Michelle Gellar said: \"That's the ultimate metaphor. You sleep with a guy and he turns bad on you.\"[78]\n\nBuffy struggles throughout the series with her calling as Slayer and the loss of freedom this entails, frequently sacrificing teenage experiences for her Slayer duties. Her difficulties and eventual empowering realizations are reflections of several dichotomies faced by modern women and echo feminist issues within society.[79]\n\nIn the episode \"Becoming (Part 2),\" when Joyce learns that Buffy is the Slayer, her reaction has strong echoes of a parent discovering her child is gay, including denial, suggesting that she try \"not being a Slayer,\" and ultimately kicking Buffy out of the house.[80]\n\nCasting [ edit ]\n\nActresses who auditioned for Buffy Summers and got other roles include Julie Benz (Darla), Elizabeth Anne Allen (Amy Madison), Julia Lee (Chantarelle/Lily Houston), Charisma Carpenter (Cordelia Chase), and Mercedes McNab (Harmony Kendall). Bianca Lawson, who played vampire slayer Kendra Young in season 2 of the show, originally auditioned for the role of Cordelia Chase before Charisma Carpenter was cast in the role.\n\nThe title role went to Sarah Michelle Gellar, who had appeared as Sydney Rutledge on Swans Crossing and Kendall Hart on All My Children. At age 18 in 1995, Gellar had already won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Leading Actress in a Drama Series.[81] In 1996, she was originally cast as Cordelia Chase during a week of auditioning. She decided to keep trying for the role of Buffy, and after several more auditions, she landed the lead.[82]\n\nThe character of Angel was only supposed to appear briefly in the pilot episode.[83] Nathan Fillion was one of the actors who auditioned for the role back in early 1996 for the unaired pilot, which did not end up featuring Angel. When the pilot was due to be reshot in September 1996, scouting for Angel began again, and by chance a talent agent spotted David Boreanaz on the sidewalk walking his dog.[83] He immediately contacted casting director Marcia Shulman, saying that he had found Angel.[83] Fillion would later portray Caleb in the show's seventh season, and would also work with Whedon on several other occasions, including Firefly.\n\nAnthony Stewart Head had already led a prolific acting and singing career,[84] but remained best known in the United States for a series of twelve coffee commercials with Sharon Maughan for Taster's Choice instant coffee.[85] He accepted the role of Rupert Giles.\n\nNicholas Brendon, unlike other Buffy regulars, had little acting experience, instead working various jobs\u2014including production assistant, plumber's assistant, veterinary janitor, food delivery, script delivery, day care counselor, and waiter\u2014before breaking into acting and overcoming his stutter.[86][87] He landed his Xander Harris role following only four days of auditioning.[88] Ryan Reynolds and Danny Strong also auditioned for the part. Strong later played the role of Jonathan Levinson, a recurring character for much of the series run.\n\nAlyson Hannigan was the last of the original six to be cast. Following her role in My Stepmother Is an Alien,[89] she appeared in commercials and supporting roles on television shows throughout the early 1990s.[89] In 1996, the role of Willow Rosenberg was originally played by Riff Regan for the unaired Buffy pilot, but Hannigan auditioned when the role was being recast for the series proper. Hannigan described her approach to the character through Willow's reaction to a particular moment: Willow sadly tells Buffy that her Barbie doll was taken from her as a child. Buffy asks her if she ever got it back. Willow's line was to reply \"most of it.\" Hannigan decided on an upbeat and happy delivery of the line \"most of it,\" as opposed to a sad, depressed delivery. Hannigan figured Willow would be happy and proud that she got \"most of it\" back. That indicated how she was going to play the rest of the scene, and the role, for that matter, and defined the character.[90] Her approach subsequently got her the role.\n\nOpening sequence [ edit ]\n\nThe Buffy opening sequence provides credits at the beginning of each episode, with the accompanying music performed by Californian rock band Nerf Herder. In the DVD commentary for the first Buffy episode, Whedon said his decision to go with Nerf Herder's theme was influenced by Hannigan, who had urged him to listen to the band's music.[91] Janet Halfyard, in her essay \"Music, Gender, and Identity in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel,\" describes the opening:\n\nFirstly ... we have the sound of an organ, accompanied by a wolf\u2019s howl, with a visual image of a flickering night sky overlaid with unintelligible archaic script: the associations with both the silent era and films such as Nosferatu and with the conventions of the Hammer House of Horror and horror in general are unmistakable.[92]\n\nBut the theme quickly changes: \"It removes itself from the sphere of 1960s and 70s horror by replaying the same motif, the organ now supplanted by an aggressively strummed electric guitar, relocating itself in modern youth culture ...\"[92] Halfyard describes sequences, in which the action and turbulence of adolescence are depicted, as the visual content of the opening credits, and which provide a postmodern twist on the horror genre.[92]\n\nBuffy has inspired a range of official and unofficial works, including television shows, books, comics, games, and podcasts. This expansion of the series encouraged use of the term \"Buffyverse\" to describe the fictional universe in which Buffy and related stories take place.[93][94]\n\nThe franchise has inspired Buffy action figures and merchandise such as official Buffy/Angel magazines and Buffy companion books. Eden Studios has published a Buffy role-playing game, while Score Entertainment has released a Buffy Collectible Card Game.\n\nContinuations [ edit ]\n\nThe storyline was continued in a series of comic books produced by Joss Whedon and published by Dark Horse Comics, which serve as a canonical continuation of the television series. The series, which began in 2007 with Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight, followed by Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine in 2011, Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten in 2014, Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eleven in 2016, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Twelve in 2018, which was the final season of the comic book series.[95]\n\nJoss Whedon was interested in a film continuation in 1998,[96] but such a film has yet to materialize.\n\nFuture series [ edit ]\n\nIn July 2018, 20th Century Fox Television began development on a television reboot of the series. Monica Owusu-Breen is to serve as showrunner and has been working on the script with Whedon, who is to be an executive producer.[12] News of Whedon's involvement is being seen as reassuring by fans,[97] though the extent of his involvement is unclear; several others from the original series are reported to be involved, including Gail Berman, Fran Kuzui, and Kaz Kuzui.[98][99] According to anonymous sources who spoke with The Hollywood Reporter and Deadline Hollywood, the producers want the new series to be \"richly diverse ... [and] some aspects of the series could be seen as metaphors for issues facing society today\"[12][98] \u2013 similar to the way Gellar described the original series as the \"ultimate metaphor\" for coping with adolescence.[24] The producers' intend \"for the new slayer to be African American\", an example of the diversity they wish to portray.[98] The report from Deadline Hollywood cautioned that \"the project is still in nascent stages with no script, and many details are still in flux\".[98]\n\nAt the time of Buffy's 20th anniversary in 2017, Whedon expressed fear of reboots, commenting that when \"something [is brought] back, and even if it's exactly as good as it was, the experience can't be. You've already experienced it, and part of what was great was going through it for the first time. You have to meet expectations and adjust it for the climate, which is not easily [done].\"[100] Similar concerns have been expressed about the decision to reboot the series, rather than to revive it or further expand the Buffyverse.[97][101] Reports that the black lead actress is to assume the iconic role of Buffy,[12][99] rather than having a new character or slayer created, have been met with questions and concerns.[97][101][102] Vox noted that \"the original series already had multiple characters of color who could factor into an 'inclusive' reboot \u2013 including the black slayer Kendra and the 'First Slayer'\" \u2013 leaving fans wondering \"why a reboot has to racebend Buffy, when it could simply focus on a different character.\"[102] A Twitter message posted by Owusu-Breen on July 26, 2018 was interpreted by media outlets as indicating that the new series would not recast the role of Buffy and instead would focus on a new Slayer.[103]\n\nAngel [ edit ]\n\nThe spin-off Angel was introduced in October 1999, at the start of Buffy season four. The series was created by Buffy's creator Joss Whedon in collaboration with David Greenwalt. Like Buffy, it was produced by the production company Mutant Enemy. At times, it performed better in the Nielsen ratings than its parent series did.[8]\n\nThe series was given a darker tone, focusing on the ongoing trials of Angel in Los Angeles. His character is tormented by guilt following the return of his soul, punishment for more than a century of murder and torture. During the first four seasons of the show, he works as a private detective in a fictionalized version of Los Angeles, California, where he and his associates work to \"help the helpless\" and to restore the faith and \"save the souls\" of those who have lost their way. Typically, this mission involves doing battle with evil demons or demonically allied humans (primarily the law firm Wolfram & Hart), while Angel must also contend with his own violent nature. In season five, the Senior Partners of Wolfram and Hart take a bold gamble in their campaign to corrupt Angel, giving him control of their Los Angeles office. Angel accepts the deal as an opportunity to fight evil from the inside.\n\nIn addition to Boreanaz, Angel inherited Buffy series cast regular Charisma Carpenter (Cordelia Chase). When Glenn Quinn (Doyle) left the series during its first season, Alexis Denisof (Wesley Wyndam-Pryce), who played a recurring character in the last nine episodes of season three of Buffy, took his place. Carpenter and Denisof were followed later by Mercedes McNab (Harmony Kendall) and James Marsters (Spike). Several actors and actresses who played Buffy characters made guest appearances on Angel, including Seth Green (Daniel \"Oz\" Osbourne), Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy Summers), Eliza Dushku (Faith), Tom Lenk (Andrew Wells), Alyson Hannigan (Willow Rosenberg), Julie Benz (Darla), Mark Metcalf (The Master), Julia Lee (Anne Steele) and Juliet Landau (Drusilla). Angel also continued to appear occasionally on Buffy.\n\nThe storyline has been continued in the comic book series Angel: After the Fall published by IDW Publishing and later Angel and Faith published by Dark Horse Comics.\n\nExpanded universe [ edit ]\n\nBuffy: Season Eight Trade paperback cover of Volume One , written by Joss Whedon.\n\nOutside of the TV series, the Buffyverse has been officially expanded and elaborated on by authors and artists in the so-called \"Buffyverse Expanded Universe.\" The creators of these works may or may not keep to established continuity. Similarly, writers for the TV series were under no obligation to use information which had been established by the Expanded Universe, and sometimes contradicted such continuity.\n\nDark Horse has published the Buffy comics since 1998.[104] In 2003, Whedon wrote an eight-issue miniseries for Dark Horse Comics titled Fray, about a Slayer in the future. Following the publication of Tales of the Vampires in 2004, Dark Horse Comics halted publication on Buffyverse-related comics and graphic novels. The company produced Whedon's Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight with forty issues from March 2007 to January 2011, picking up where the television show left off\u2014taking the place of an eighth canonical season.[51] The first story arc is also written by Whedon, and is called \"The Long Way Home\" which has been widely well-received, with circulation rivalling industry leaders DC and Marvel's top-selling titles.[105] Also after \"The Long Way Home\" came other story arcs like Faith's return in \"No Future for You\" and a Fray cross-over in \"Time of Your Life.\" Dark Horse later followed Season Eight with Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine, starting in 2011, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten, which began in 2014.\n\nPocket Books hold the license to produce Buffy novels, of which they have published more than sixty since 1998. These sometimes flesh out background information on characters; for example, Go Ask Malice details the events that lead up to Faith arriving in Sunnydale. The most recent novels include Carnival of Souls, Blackout, Portal Through Time, Bad Bargain, and The Deathless.\n\nFive official Buffy video games have been released on portable and home consoles.[106] Most notably, Buffy the Vampire Slayer for Xbox in 2002 and Chaos Bleeds for GameCube, Xbox and PlayStation 2 in 2003.[107]\n\nUndeveloped spinoffs [ edit ]\n\nThe popularity of Buffy and Angel has led to attempts to develop more on-screen ventures in the fictional 'Buffyverse'. These projects remain undeveloped and may never be greenlit. In 2002, two potential spinoffs were in discussion: Buffy: The Animated Series and Ripper. Buffy: The Animated Series was a proposed animated TV show based on Buffy; Whedon and Jeph Loeb were to be executive producers for the show, and most of the cast from Buffy were to return to voice their characters. 20th Century Fox showed an interest in developing and selling the show to another network. A three-minute pilot was completed in 2004, but was never picked up. Whedon revealed to The Hollywood Reporter: \"We just could not find a home for it. We had six or seven hilarious scripts from our own staff \u2013 and nobody wanted it.\"[108] Neither the pilot nor the scripts have been seen outside of the entertainment industry, though writer Jane Espenson has teasingly revealed small extracts from some of her scripts for the show.[109]\n\nRipper was originally a proposed television show based upon the character of Rupert Giles portrayed by Anthony Stewart Head. More recent information has suggested that if Ripper were ever made, it would be a TV movie or a DVD movie.[110] There was little heard about the series until 2007 when Joss Whedon confirmed that talks were almost completed for a 90 minute Ripper special on the BBC[111] with both Head and the BBC completely on board.\n\nIn 2003, a year after the first public discussions on Buffy: The Animated Series and Ripper, Buffy was nearing its end. Espenson has said that during this time spinoffs were discussed, \"I think Marti talked with Joss about Slayer School and Tim Minear talked with him about Faith on a motorcycle. I assume there was some back-and-forth pitching.\"[112] Espenson has revealed that Slayer School might have used new slayers and potentially included Willow Rosenberg, but Whedon did not think that such a spinoff felt right.[113][114]\n\nDushku declined the pitch for a Buffyverse TV series based on Faith and instead agreed to a deal to produce Tru Calling. Dushku explained to IGN: \"It would have been a really hard thing to do, and not that I would not have been up for a challenge, but with it coming on immediately following Buffy, I think that those would have been really big boots to fill.\"[115] Tim Minear explained some of the ideas behind the aborted series: \"The show was basically going to be Faith meets Kung Fu. It would have been Faith, probably on a motorcycle, crossing the earth, trying to find her place in the world.\"[116]\n\nFinally, during the summer of 2004 after the end of Angel, a movie about Spike was proposed.[117] The movie would have been directed by Tim Minear and starred Marsters and Amy Acker and featured Alyson Hannigan.[118] Outside the 2006 Saturn Awards, Whedon announced that he had pitched the concept to various bodies but had yet to receive any feedback.[119]\n\nIn September 2008, Sci-Fi Wire ran an interview with Sarah Michelle Gellar in which she said she would not rule out returning to her most iconic role: \"Never say never,\" she said. \"One of the reasons the original Buffy movie did not really work on the big screen\u2013and people blamed Kristy, but that's not what it was\u2013the story was better told over a long arc,\" Gellar said. \"And I worry about Buffy as a 'beginning, middle and end' so quickly. ... You show me a script; you show me that it works, and you show me that [the] audience can accept that, [and] I'd probably be there. Those are what my hesitations are.\"[120]\n\nCultural impact [ edit ]\n\nAnthony Stewart Head and Nicholas Brendon at the Oakland Super SlayerCon fan convention\n\nAcademia [ edit ]\n\nBuffy is notable for attracting the interest of scholars of popular culture, as a subset of popular culture studies, and some academic settings include the show as a topic of literary study and analysis.[121][122] National Public Radio describes Buffy as having a \"special following among academics, some of whom have staked a claim in what they call 'Buffy Studies.'\"[123] Though not widely recognized as a distinct discipline, the term \"Buffy studies\" is commonly used amongst the peer-reviewed academic Buffy-related writings.[124] The influence of Buffy on the depiction of vampires across popular culture has also been noted by anthropologists such as A. Asbj\u00f8rn J\u00f8n.[125][126] Popular media researcher Rob Cover argued that Buffy and Angel speak to contemporary attitudes to identity, inclusion and diversity, and that critiquing the characters' long-narrative stories lends insight into the complexity of identity in the current era and the landscape of social issues in which those identities are performed.[127][128]\n\nCritics have emerged in response to the academic attention the series has received. For example, Jes Battis, who authored Blood Relations in Buffy and Angel, admits that study of the Buffyverse \"invokes an uneasy combination of enthusiasm and ire\" and meets \"a certain amount of disdain from within the halls of the academy.\"[129] Nonetheless, Buffy eventually led to the publication of around twenty books and hundreds of articles examining the themes of the show from a wide range of disciplinary perspectives, including sociology, Speech Communication, psychology, philosophy, and women's studies.[130] In a 2012 study by Slate, Buffy the Vampire Slayer was named the most studied pop culture work by academics, with more than 200 papers, essays, and books devoted to the series.[131]\n\nThe Whedon Studies Association produces the online academic journal Slayage and sponsors a biennial academic conference on the works of Whedon. The sixth \"Biennial Slayage Conference\", titled \"Much Ado About Whedon\", was held at California State University-Sacramento in late June 2014.[132]\n\nFandom and fan films [ edit ]\n\nThe popularity of Buffy has led to websites, online discussion forums, works of Buffy fan fiction and several unofficial fan-made productions.[133] Since the end of the series, Whedon has stated that his intention was to produce a \"cult\" television series and has acknowledged a \"rabid, almost insane fan base\" that the show has created.[132][94] In 2016, Jenny Owen Youngs and Kristin Russo began the Buffering the Vampire Slayer podcast, recognized as one of the top podcasts in production by Time and Esquire magazines.[134][135] In 2017 the 20th anniversary of the show attracted even more writers to create their own adventures of the series' characters.[136]\n\nBuffy in popular culture [ edit ]\n\nThe series, which employed pop culture references as a frequent humorous device, has itself become a frequent pop culture reference in video games, comics and television shows and has been frequently parodied and spoofed. Sarah Michelle Gellar has participated in several parody sketches, including a Saturday Night Live sketch in which the Slayer is relocated to the Seinfeld universe,[137] and adding her voice to an episode of Robot Chicken that parodied a would-be eighth season of Buffy.[138]\n\n\"Buffy\" was the code-name used for an early HTC mobile phone which integrated the social networking website Facebook.[139]\n\nIn March 2017 in honor of Buffy the Vampire Slayer's 20th-anniversary, Entertainment Weekly reunited Joss Whedon and the whole cast for their first joint interview and photo shoot in over a decade.[140]\n\nU.S. television ratings [ edit ]\n\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer season rankings in the U.S. television market Season Episodes Original air dates Network TV season Time slot Nielsen ratings (including repeats) Season premiere Season finale Rank Viewers (in millions) Network rank 1 12 March 10, 1997 ( ) June 2, 1997 ( 1997-06-02 ) The WB 1996\u201397 Monday 9:00 pm #144 3.7[141] #6 2 22 September 15, 1997 ( ) May 19, 1998 ( 1998-05-19 ) 1997\u201398 Monday 9:00 pm (episodes 1\u201313)\n\nTuesday 8:00 pm (episodes 14\u201322) #133 5.2[141] #3 3 22 September 29, 1998 ( ) September 21, 1999 ( 1999-09-21 ) 1998\u201399 Tuesday 8:00 pm 5.3[141] #2 (tied) 4 22 October 5, 1999 ( ) May 23, 2000 ( 2000-05-23 ) 1999\u20132000 #120 5.1[141] #3 5 22 September 26, 2000 ( ) May 22, 2001 ( 2001-05-22 ) 2000\u201301 4.6[142] 6 22 October 2, 2001 ( ) May 21, 2002 ( 2002-05-21 ) UPN 2001\u201302 #124 4.3[143] 7 22 September 24, 2002 ( ) May 20, 2003 ( 2003-05-20 ) 2002\u201303 #140 3.9[144] #4\n\nBuffy helped put The WB on the ratings map, but by the time the series landed on UPN in 2001, viewing figures had fallen. The series' high came during the third season, with 5.3 million viewers (including repeats). This was probably due to the fact that both Gellar and Hannigan had hit movies out during the season (Cruel Intentions and American Pie respectively). The series' low was in season one at 3.7 million. The show's series finale \"Chosen\" pulled in a season high of 4.9 million viewers on the UPN network.[145]\n\nBuffy did not compete with shows on the main four networks (CBS, ABC, NBC, and Fox), but The WB was impressed with the young audience that the show was bringing in. Because of this, The WB ordered a full season of 22 episodes for the series' second season. Beginning with the episode \"Innocence,\" which was watched by 8.2 million people, Buffy was moved from Monday at 9:00 pm to launch The WB's new night of programming on Tuesday. Due to its large success in that time slot, it remained on Tuesdays at 8:00 pm for the remainder of its original run. With its new timeslot on The WB, the show quickly climbed to the top of The WB ratings and became one of their highest-rated shows for the remainder of its time on the network. The show always placed in the top 3, usually only coming in behind 7th Heaven. Between seasons three and five, Buffy flip-flopped with Dawson's Creek and Charmed as the network's second highest-rated show.\n\nIn the 2001\u20132002 season, the show had moved to UPN after a negotiation dispute with The WB. While it was still one of their highest rated shows on their network, The WB felt that the show had already peaked and was not worth giving a salary increase to the cast and crew. UPN on the other hand, had strong faith in the series and picked it up for a two-season renewal.[146] UPN dedicated a two-hour premiere to the series to help re-launch it. The relaunching had effect, as the season premiere attracted the second highest rating of the series, with 7.7 million viewers.[147]\n\nImpact on television [ edit ]\n\nCommentators of the entertainment industry including The Village Voice, PopMatters, Allmovie, The Hollywood Reporter, The Washington Post have cited Buffy as \"influential.\"[94] Some citing it as the ascent of television into its golden age.[148] Stephanie Zacharek, in the Village Voice, wrote \"If we really are in a golden age of television, Buffy the Vampire Slayer was a harbinger.\"[149] Robert Moore of Popmatters also expressed these sentiments, writing \"TV was not art before Buffy, but it was afterwards,\" suggesting that it was responsible for re-popularizing long story arcs on primetime television.[150][151]\n\nIts effect on programming was quickly evident. Autumn 2003 saw several new shows going into production in the U.S. that featured strong females who are forced to come to terms with supernatural power or destiny while trying to maintain a normal life.[152] These post-Buffy shows include Dead Like Me, Joan of Arcadia, Tru Calling, Veronica Mars and Teen Wolf. Bryan Fuller, the creator of Dead Like Me, said that \"Buffy showed that young women could be in situations that were both fantastic and relatable, and instead of shunting women off to the side, it puts them at the center.\"[152] In the United Kingdom, the lessons learned from the impact of Buffy influenced the revived Doctor Who series (2005\u2013present),[153] and executive producer Russell T Davies has said:\n\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer showed the whole world, and an entire sprawling industry, that writing monsters and demons and end-of-the world is not hack-work, it can challenge the best. Joss Whedon raised the bar for every writer\u2014not just genre/niche writers, but every single one of us.[154]\n\nAs well as influencing Doctor Who, Buffy influenced its spinoff series Torchwood.[155]\n\nSeveral Buffy alumni have gone on to write for or create other shows. Such endeavors include Tru Calling (Douglas Petrie, Jane Espenson and lead actress Eliza Dushku), Wonderfalls (Tim Minear), Point Pleasant (Marti Noxon), Jake 2.0 (David Greenwalt), The Inside (Tim Minear), Smallville (Steven S. DeKnight), Once Upon a Time (Jane Espenson), and Lost (Drew Goddard and David Fury).\n\nMeanwhile, the Parents Television Council complained of efforts to \"deluge their young viewing audiences with adult themes.\"[156] The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC), however, rejected the Council's indecency complaint concerning the violent sex scene between Buffy and Spike in \"Smashed.\"[157] The BBC, however, chose to censor some of the more controversial sexual content when it was shown on the pre-watershed 6:45 pm slot.[158]\n\n\n\n\n\nAwards and nominations [ edit ]\n\nBuffy has gathered a number of awards and nominations which include an Emmy Award nomination for the 1999 episode \"Hush\", which featured an extended sequence with no character dialogue.[159][151] The 2001 episode \"The Body\" was filmed with no musical score, only diegetic music; it was nominated for a Nebula Award in 2002.[159][14] The 2001 musical episode \"Once More, with Feeling\" received plaudits, but was omitted from Emmy nomination ballots by \"accident.\"[160] It since was featured on Channel 4's \"100 Greatest Musicals.\"[161] In 2001, Sarah Michelle Gellar received a Golden Globe-nomination for Best Actress in a TV Series-Drama for her role in the show, as well nominations for the Teen Choice Awards and the Saturn Award for Best Genre TV Actress. The series won the Drama Category for Television's Most Memorable Moment at the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards for \"The Gift\" beating The X-Files, Grey's Anatomy, Brian's Song and Dallas, although the sequence for this award was not aired.\n\nIt was nominated for Emmy and Golden Globe awards, winning a total of three Emmys. However, snubs in lead Emmy categories resulted in outrage among TV critics and the decision by the academy to hold a tribute event in honor of the series after it had gone off the air in 2003.[162]\n\n\"Best of\" lists [ edit ]\n\nHome media [ edit ]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]"}

{"label": true, "txt": "It's been just over a year since professional football player Michael Strahan suddenly left his co-host Kelly Ripa to host Good Morning America, leaving the show called, simply, Live! With Kelly.\n\nToday, Ripa, who has been hosting the syndicated show since 2001 when she joined original host Regis Philbin, announced her new co-host: veteran host Ryan Seacrest.\n\nThe television producer responsible for the Kardashian franchises started out on ESPN before moving to various game shows and smaller reality programs. He got his big break in 2002 as the host of American Idol, which made him a household name. In 2005 he began hosting New Years Rocking Eve, and in 2006 he started hosting E! News. He has previously tried his hand at daytime TV: On-Air with Ryan Seacrest, a syndicated talkshow, lasted less than a year in 2004.\n\nNow, Seacrest, who earned $55 million last year, hosts a syndicated radio show for Los Angeles\u2019 KIIS-FM, in addition to having an overall production (and occasional hosting) deal with NBC Universal. His new hosting gig on an ABC shouldn't affect any of his production contracts (his Ryan Seacrest Productions produces shows for Fox, CBS and NBC), though we likely won't be seeing him on-air at the Peacock at the next Olympics.\n\n\u201cRyan is a quintessential broadcaster and at the top of his game,\u201d said Ripa in a statement. \u201cI am thrilled to start my mornings with him every day, and we are so fortunate at \u2018Live\u2019 to have him join the family. Ryan is a close friend and his star shines as brightly off camera as it does on. His tremendous success is only matched by his impeccable reputation. Plainly said, everyone loves him, and so will our daily viewers.\u201d\n\nRather than immediately replace Strahan\u2014who left abruptly without ABC giving Ripa or the show's executive producer much notice\u2014a series of guest hosts (including Seacrest) took turns in the hot seat next to Ripa.\n\nThe rotating hosts did well for ratings. The show, which is distributed by ABC's parent company Disney, maintained its spot as the number two syndicated daytime talk show behind Dr. Phil. In most markets, the show airs during the 9 a.m. hour and beats the third hour of Today. The show brings in an estimated $85 to $90 million for ABC thanks to ad revenue and license fees.\n\nWhile Ripa may have been upset about the manner in which ABC handled Strahan's departure\u2014in an on-air statement at the time, she condemned the network for not keeping her in the loop about its plans\u2014she likely ended up with the long end of the stick, at least where money is concerned.\n\nPrior to Strahan's departure, Forbes estimates that Ripa was making about $15 million per year from the show. (She made a total $17 million last year thanks to padding her income with endorsement deals). But after she was left in the dark about Strahan's departure and had to host the show alone for a year, she likely ended up with quite a bit of negotiating power when it came to her next contract, which will be in effect starting during 2017-2018 season. On top of that, without having to pay Strahan, the show likely had extra cash in its budget to pay her a hefty bonus for this past season.\n\nThe well-known Seacrest will cost the show a pretty penny\u2014he's even willing to relocate from Los Angeles to New York for the gig\u2014but it will likely prove worth it. With a built-in fan base, Seacrest's visibility will increase that of the show, and with his hand in so many other pots\u2014from music to television to clothing\u2014he has existing relationships with many potential guests."}

It was unfortunate that no one really knew how intoxicated I actually was at the time. I believe that nobody knew that. It was nobody\u2019s fault.

{"label": true, "txt": "DUN DUN DUN. \u201cOh baby, baby ... \u201d. In just three seconds ...Baby One More Time, which turns 20 this year, announced the arrival of a new superstar: the then 16-year-old ex-Mouseketeer from Kentwood, Louisiana, Britney Jean Spears. Along with its equally iconic high school-set music video it re-turfed pop, kickstarting an entire sound (think funk-tinged R&B grooves mixed with Abba melodies), sweeping aside the dregs of grunge (sorry, Bush) and US heartland rock (bye, Hootie & the Blowfish), revitalising pop radio and MTV in the process, before cementing its songwriter and co-producer Max Martin as one of modern music\u2019s most influential exponents. In the space of just three minutes and 31 seconds, Spears launched millennial teen pop, fusing family-friendly, girl-next-door fun with good old fashioned controversy, forging a template for those who followed.\n\nWithout it, there would by no Christina Aguilera, no Katy Perry, no Charli XCX; Taylor Swift would probably still be singing country songs, and Eminem \u2013 who arrived in 1999 \u2013 would not have had as much to rail against. Released in the wake of Alanis Morissette\u2019s hugely successful 1995 album Jagged Little Pill and its litany of imitators, it presented a different angle to the prevalent idea of female angst; this was gloriously OTT teen girl longing, encapsulated by a lyric \u2013 \u201cMy loneliness is killing me\u201d \u2013 that feels depressingly evergreen. \u201cThe whole song is about that stress that we all go through as teens,\u201d Spears tells me. \u201cI knew it was a great song. It was different and I loved it, [but] I don\u2019t think you can anticipate how a song is going to be received.\u201d\n\nIn a Sliding Doors-esque moment that could have changed the world as we know it, \u2026Baby One More Time very nearly didn\u2019t get written at all, with the song\u2019s melody bubbling up as Martin was drifting off to sleep. Having hauled himself out of bed to his nearby dictaphone, he sketched out the song. \u201cI remember listening back to [the tape] after [the song] blew up and you can hear me sort of go: \u2018Hit me baby one more time\u2019, then I hear myself say, Yeah, it\u2019s pretty good,\u2019\u201d the notoriously interview-shy Martin told Swedish journalist Jan Gradvall in 2016. Martin, convinced he\u2019d written an R&B song (\u201cPop music with a flavour \u2013 what we call R&B in Sweden, what you guys [in America] say is pop,\u201d he said in 1998), sent the song, then called Hit Me Baby (One More Time), to TLC who rejected it. \u201cI was like: \u2018I like the song but do I think it\u2019s a hit? Do I think it\u2019s TLC?\u2019 \u2026 Was I going to say \u2018Hit me baby one more time\u2019? Hell no!\u201d said T-Boz in 2013.\n\nWhile TLC interpreted the lyrics as alluding to domestic violence, they actually represented Martin\u2019s attempts at American slang, believing \u201chit me\u201d could seamlessly replace \u201ccall me\u201d. The song was then offered to fellow Swede, Robyn, whom Martin had already worked with on two US top 10 singles (Do You Know (What It Takes) and Show Me Love, both released in 1997), but again nothing came of it. According to Tim Bower\u2019s 2012 book, Sweet Revenge: The Intimate Life of Simon Cowell, the song had one further dalliance with a pop act other than Britney. The story goes that after hearing Martin\u2019s demo of what had now been renamed \u2026Baby One More Time, Cowell demanded he have the song for his latest boyband, UK rabble Five. Martin had already co-written Five\u2019s debut single, Slam Dunk (Da Funk) alongside his mentor, the late Denniz Pop, but declined Cowell\u2019s request, saying it had already been earmarked for Spears. \u201cYou\u2019re mad,\u201d Cowell is reported to have said. \u201cNo one can be successful with a name like that.\u201d As a last gasp attempt, Cowell offered Martin a new Merc 500SL in return for the song. \u201cIt costs \u00a395,000,\u201d he added.\n\nIt was \u2026Baby One More Time that convinced Spears of the merits of pop. She initially saw herself as making \u201cSheryl Crow music, but younger\u201d, while Larry Rudolph, an entertainment lawyer friend of Spears\u2019s mum Lynne who had been tasked with getting her signed (he\u2019s now her manager), had her record a clutch of songs originally recorded by Toni Braxton. It was those recordings that lead to auditions for Mercury, Epic and Jive (the first two labels said no; she signed with the latter) which included Spears covering Whitney Houston\u2019s version of I Will Always Love You. With the more R&B-leaning early material not working, and with a clause allowing Jive to terminate her contract after 90 days if they felt an album wasn\u2019t on the horizon, A&R Steve Lunt approached Martin, who had already delivered success for Jive\u2019s boyband the Backstreet Boys. A meeting was set up with Spears in New York. \u201cI was pretty young at the time, so I was nervous,\u201d she says, \u201cbut he was so nice and put me right at ease.\u201d For Martin, his song had finally found its home.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Maxed out: Spears and Martin, 2017. Photograph: Lester Cohen/WireImage\n\nFrom New York, Spears de-camped to Martin\u2019s Cheiron studios in Stockholm to start recording. \u201cI remember being so in awe of Stockholm,\u201d Spears says. \u201cI was out there for, like, 10 days, but we were so busy in the studio I didn\u2019t have time to go out and explore on that first trip.\u201d The song\u2019s co-producer Rami Yacoub remembers Spears as \u201cvery shy and super sweet \u2013 I mean she was a kid and we had no idea there was a beast of an artist lurking under that innocent look\u201d. The sessions were intense, with four of the album\u2019s five singles recorded in that time. In 2001, Martin referred to the Cheiron sound as \u201cdirect, effective, we don\u2019t show off\u201d, words reiterated by Yacoub. \u201cA song that sounds simple is not simple to make. It\u2019s all about the taste and making sure you don\u2019t add more than what the song needs.\u201d\n\nFor Spears, working with perfectionists suited her. \u201cI really respect that when I\u2019m working with him,\u201d she says. \u201cI think Max is a genius. It all just came together and felt right. In my opinion Max is the greatest songwriter of all time.\u201d\n\nAnother person to witness firsthand this studied effortlessness was Nana Hedin, a backing vocalist who had previously worked with Denniz Pop on songs by Dr Alban, whose 1992 hit It\u2019s My Life soundtracked a Tampax advert in the UK. Pop recommended Hedin to Martin, who brought her onboard for \u2026Baby One More Time. \u201cI remember I thought the song was for teenagers but the production was filled with a grown-up attitude and sounds that I really liked,\u201d she says. \u201cI was so impressed by how a guy like Max could write lyrics that got into the hearts and spoke to the teenage thinking.\u201d Occasionally, Hedin would record her backing vocals first, before the artist arrived, but with \u2026Baby One More Time Spears\u2019s vocals were already recorded. \u201cI tried to sound exactly like her,\u201d she laughs. \u201cIt was hard, but a lot of fun. I\u2019m like a parrot in many ways. I try to get the same vibe and use the exact same pronunciation as the artist. In one harmony, each take is different; I sing very high, in another I use powerful belting, the next I\u2019m whispering and sometimes I even pinch my nose for a sharper sound.\u201d\n\nWith Britney\u2019s vocals recorded in March, and the song finished shortly after (\u201cIt took probably around two to three weeks to finish,\u201d says Yacoub), Spears headed out on a summer tour, taking in 26 shopping malls. Aware that they had a potential hit on their hands, Jive sent reps out to meet with the influential US radio programme directors ahead of the song\u2019s October release. \u201cThe label guy brought in a video featuring Britney rehearsing dance moves to the song,\u201d remembers Clarke Ingram, then operations manager and program director of New York\u2019s Top 40 radio station WPXY. \u201cThis had the desired effect of showing me that Britney had star quality, in addition to having a potential hit record. We went to lunch afterwards, and I committed to adding the song at that time.\u201d In fact, Ingram is pretty sure he was the first person to play the song on US radio. \u201cNo other station would have heard it any earlier, and I know of no station that played it before we did.\u201d For Ingram, \u2026Baby One More Time represented the holy grail: a song pop radio could fully own. \u201cWe\u2019d been through an alternative cycle in the early to mid-90s, and something of an R&B cycle after that,\u201d he explains. \u201cBritney was among the first big artists in a pop cycle that began in the late 1990s and continued into the early 2000s. The song hit the centre of the Top 40 audience, and it proved that by its performance, both on the air and off.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest She\u2019s so lucky: Britney in 1999. Photograph: ACTION PRESS/REX/Shutterstock\n\nThe song sold 500,000 copies on its first day of release in the US, eventually peaking at No 1. It reached No 1 in every single country it charted in, and was 1999\u2019s biggest-selling song in the UK with 1.4m copies sold. A megastar had been created seemingly overnight. \u201cI don\u2019t think we understood what we had done,\u201d Martin said in a 2008 Swedish radio documentary. \u201cI remember sitting in the studio when they called me to let me know that my song had made No 1 in the USA \u2026 I had so much going on I didn\u2019t really grasp the meaning of it\u201d. He even forgot to tell Yacoub. \u201cMax walked into the studio one day while I was working and said: \u2018Hey man, by the way, we are No 1 in America,\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cI asked him when it had happened and he said: \u2018Three weeks ago.\u2019 We really didn\u2019t focus on charts, we just kept working.\u201d Even celebrations were muted. \u201cIt was on a Tuesday, I believe: an early dinner, a cigar, and to bed at 11pm as we had work the next day.\u201d\n\nAn iconic song needed an iconic video. Unfortunately, director Nigel Dick\u2019s original concept was deemed a dud by Spears. \u201cI wrote an idea which sucked, so the label put me back on the phone with Britney who told me she wanted to make a video where she was stuck in a classroom thinking about boys and we took it from there,\u201d Dick writes on the harangued-sounding FAQ section of his website. He also states the school uniform look, augmented by plaited bunches and bare midriff, was Spears\u2019s idea too. What seems relatively tame now caused uproar in a bubblegum pop era that, via shows like MTV\u2019s popular Total Request Live, was being fed directly into family homes.\n\nThe video, an instant pop culture moment that gave Spears all-important tabloid notoriety, also fused in the public consciousness with David LaChapelle\u2019s controversial 1999 Rolling Stone cover shoot featuring Spears lying on her childhood bed in her underwear clutching a Teletubby. Suddenly, the now turbo-charged teen pop genre had its flag bearer, one whose identity \u2013 sweet southern belle in the video for soft-focus follow-up single Sometimes; red PVC-clad dominatrix in the \u201cnot that innocent\u201d Oops!\u2026I Did It Again visual \u2013 was malleable enough to, at least initially, be everything all at once. How does Spears feel about the song almost 20 years later? \u201cWow, that went quick. It was such a fun and crazy time, it was a bit of a blur.\u201d\n\nBritney Spears plays Open Air Theatre, Scarborough, Friday 17 August; touring to 1 September"}

He claims that these malicious rumors serve a single purpose; to blacken his name and damage him.\u201d Hurtig has yet to respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for further comment.\n\nOne of the princess\u2019s aides forcibly removed Arnault\u2019s hand from Victoria\u2019s buttocks, according to reports in Svenska Dagbladet and other local media outlets, including Sweden\u2019s national broadcaster STV, who cited multiple sources.\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty\n\n\u201cHe was lurking behind (her) and I saw his hand land on her neck and go down. All the way down,\u201d Ebba Witt-Brattstr\u00f6m, a 64-year-old scholar in comparative literature, said.\n\nOne of the Victoria\u2019s female assistants immediately neutralized the situation, Witt-Brattstr\u00f6m added.\n\n\u201cShe just flew at Arnault. She grabbed him and pushed him away,\u201d Witt-Brattstr\u00f6m told Sweden\u2019s Expressen newspaper. \u201cThe Crown Princess turned in surprise. I guess she had never been groped. She just looked like \u2018What?\u2019 \u201d\n\nAt the time of the alleged incident, Arnault was 59 years old, and Crown Princess Victoria was 27.\n\nGet push notifications with news, features and more.\n\nCrown Princess Victoria of Sweden and Per Westerberg arrive at the 2006 Nobel Foundation Gala on December 10, 2006 in Stockholm Pascal Le Segretain/Getty\n\nIn November 2017, the Swedish Academy was rocked by allegations made by 18 women claiming that Arnault had either groped or harassed them at a cultural center he ran or at Swedish Academy-owned apartments in Stockholm and Paris.\n\nFrench-born Arnault, 71, is currently married to former Swedish Academy member Katarina Frostenson, 65. He denies all accusations made against him. No criminal charges have been filed.\n\nCrown Princess Victoria of Sweden at the 2006 Nobel Foundation Gala Pascal Le Segretain/Getty\n\nSweden\u2019s Royal Palace has not officially commented on the incident, but has previously indicated its support for the #MeToo campaign. Crown Princess Victoria, now 40, and her mother Queen Sylvia both personally visited a Stockholm theatre presenting actress\u2019 accounts of sexual harassment within the entrainment industry in November 2017.\n\nAt that time, Princess Victoria told local media that #MeToo was \u201can extremely important campaign.\u201d\n\nCan\u2019t get enough of PEOPLE\u2019s Royals coverage?

Technically none can resign as they are life-long appointments \u2014 but they also cannot be forced to participate in the Academy\u2019s activities, including the 2018 Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\n\u201cAfter our next Thursday meeting there will most probably be a statement on whether we will award a prize this year or reserve it for next year, in which case two prizes for literature will be announced in October 2019,\u201d Per W\u00e4stberg, a committee spokesman, told The Guardian.\n\nA decision will likely be announced early next week, he added."}

McCarthy was absent entirely from the show\u2019s cold open, and chose to focus on an apolitical topic, Mother\u2019s Day, during her first sketch of the evening. McCarthy also defied expectations by largely ignoring the fact that this is her fifth time hosting Saturday Night Live. The show has a history of making a big deal of a host\u2019s induction into the Five-Timer\u2019s Club\u2014but, perhaps because McCarthy made such fuss over almost getting there last year, S.N.L. decided to take a pass on bringing it up in the monologue.\n\nMcCarthy did, however, acknowledge some show history when she took an unsuspecting mom from the audience on a backstage tour that included cameos from a pantsless Alec Baldwin, as well as Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds (or, as McCarthy calls them, \u201cthe Livelys\u201d). But the real star of that tour was the llama McCarthy encountered in the hallway. For more on why that particular animal is so significant, you can go here.

In her accompanying interview with the magazine, she opens up about her first marriage with Ryan Sweeting -- and what led to their divorce.\n\nCuoco, 32, and Sweeting, 30, became engaged in September 2013 after three months of dating, and tied the knot on Dec. 31, 2013, in Santa Susana, California. They announced they were going their separate ways in September 2015, and according to Cuoco, it was all Sweeting's doing.\n\n\"I honestly thought I wouldn\u2019t get married again,\" Kuoco, who's currently planning her wedding with fianc\u00e9 Karl Cook, recalls. \"My ex ruined that word for me.\"\n\n\"I married someone the first time who completely changed,\" she continues. \"The person I ended up with was not the person I originally met. And that wasn\u2019t my fault -- that was his. I knew how much I had to give and how much I wanted to receive. I knew I just had to be patient\u2026I had to go through a lot of things, but it brought me to Karl.\"\n\nJason Kim/Cosmopolitan\n\nClearly, Cuoco has moved past heartbreak and found love again with Cook, who she started dating in late 2016.

I don't let people mess with me. I want to show girls out there that you can be cool, wear yoga clothes, and run your own f**king company. You don't have to be a guy in a suit.\"\n\n\"I want this to be a big company,\" she adds. \"I want to be sitting down a few years from now and have so many projects going. That's what I'm excited about.\"\n\nJason Kim/Cosmopolitan\n\nBut right now, wedding planning comes first! Cuoco announced last November that Cook had popped the question, and the two celebrated with a trip to Disneyland in Anaheim, California, a few weeks later. \"He took me to Disneyland and it was pure magic,\" Cuoco shared on Instagram at the time. \"Mad love for this group that surrounds me!\"\n\nET caught up with Cuoco at the Stand Up for Pits Benefit in Hollywood, California, just a few weeks before Cook got down on one knee. Cuoco seemed smitten by her beau, telling us he was \"totally the guy\" for her.\n\n\"I think the common denominator is the horses, it just works for us,\" she said of her and Cook's shared passion for equestrian and animals. \"We have this special bond so, yeah, the animals.

{"label": true, "txt": "All the Surprise Songs Taylor Swift Has Performed On Her Reputation Stadium Tour B-Stage (So Far)\n\nTaylor Swift performs onstage during the Reputation Stadium Tour at NRG Stadium on Sept. 29, 2018 in Houston, Texas.\n\nTaylor Swift's Reputation-heavy tour set list features almost all the songs from her latest album, plus many of her previous hit singles. But the show, which she debuted on May 8, also delivers a surprise song on each tour stop. Swift's nightly choices have run the gamut from fan favorite \"All Too Well\" to career throwback \"Teardrops on My Guitar.\"\n\nWhile most of Swift's performance is based on the main stage, she makes her way back to two smaller B-stages, giving more fans a chance to see her up close. There, she performs \"Shake It Off,\" \"Dancing With Our Hands Tied,\" \"Blank Space\" and \"Dress\" -- as well as the surprise song of the night on acoustic guitar.\n\nBelow, check out the list of all the special songs she's brought to the Reputation Tour B-stage. Luckily, Swifties in the crowd have been quick to upload clips of these rare live cuts.\n\n\"All Too Well\"\n\nGlendale, Ariz., May 8; Pasadena, Calif., May 19; Arlington, Texas, Oct. 6\n\nIt's no secret among Swift fans that the emotional Red stand-out \"All Too Well\" is widely cherished. What better surprise to sprinkle into the set list on the opening night of tour, then? \"I figured...I would play this song you seem to request more than the others,\" she said, introducing the beautiful tearjerker.\n\nA post shared by Simone (@simoneyybaloneyy) on May 9, 2018 at 12:38am PDT\n\n\"Wildest Dreams\"\n\nSanta Clara, Calif., May 11; Tokyo, Japan, Nov. 21\n\nSwift once performed \"Wildest Dreams\" acoustic at a Grammys event, and she brought that raw, impassioned version of the 1989 song to the Reputation Stadium Tour B-stage twice -- first in Santa Clara, then on the final night of tour in Tokyo.\n\nA bit of Wildest Dreams from the 1st night in Santa Clara #repTourSantaClara #TaylorSwift pic.twitter.com/FyUCIyww9i \u2014 Erica Love (@Erica_Love16) May 13, 2018\n\n\"The Best Day\"\n\nSanta Clara, Calif., May 12\n\nOn Mother's Day weekend, Swift gifted her mom -- and, apparently, tour opener Camila Cabello's mom -- with this touching ode to the mother-daughter memories they've made. The sweet Fearless track is one that is rarely performed live.\n\nA post shared by taylor swift fan page (@taylorswift_gorgeous13) on May 13, 2018 at 2:48pm PDT\n\n\"Red\"\n\nPasadena, Calif., May 18\n\nThe Rose Bowl served as inspiration for Swift's B-stage surprise on her first of two nights at the venue. \"Roses are red,\" she mused. Cue an acoustic take on \"Red,\" the title track off of her 2012 album.\n\n\"Holy Ground\"\n\nSeattle, Wash., May 22\n\n\"Holy Ground\" is all about romanticizing the time you've shared with someone -- and an excellent selection to surprise an audience full of longtime, loyal fans with. \"Tonight I'm gonna dance for all that we've been through,\" she sings. \"But I don't wanna dance if I'm not dancing with you.\"\n\n@taylorswift13 sang Holy Ground in front of me so close she smiled at me she saw my outfit, my heart sign and smiled.

Based on this clip, the classic from her canon had just about everyone singing along. Will she \"play it again\"?\n\n\"22\"\n\nChicago, June 2; Foxborough, Mass., July 26; Sydney, Australia, Nov. 2\n\nSwift's friend Martha Hunt says she's the one who suggested \"22\" as the surprise song on night two in Chicago, and Swift credited the enthusiastic crowd at her first night in Foxborough for her decision to perform it again. It's not every day that you get \"22\" acoustic, but Swifties got it three times so far on this tour, the most recent of which came during a rain-heavy performance in Sydney.\n\n\"I Knew You Were Trouble\"\n\nManchester, England, June 8\n\nIt's unlikely that the Manchester crowd of Swifties did not know the lyrics to \"I Knew You Were Trouble,\" but the pop star offered some advice anyway: \"Even if you don't know the words, it's kind of easy to remember this one part.\" She led them in a practice round of the post-chorus \"oh, oh!\" and went on to deliver an acoustic rendition of the frenetic tune.\n\n\"I Don't Wanna Live Forever\"\n\nManchester, England, June 9\n\nThose who attended the second Taylor Swift stadium show in Manchester were in for a treat: a rare live performance of \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever,\" Swift's 50 Shades duet with Zayn.\n\n\"Mean\"\n\nDublin, Ireland, June 15\n\nPlaying \"Mean\" live is a sure crowd-pleaser, and Swift did just that at the first of two headlining shows in Dublin. Although the song was a mainstay back in her days touring in support of Speak Now and Red, this date marked the debut of \"Mean\" seeing the Reputation Stadium Tour stage.\n\n\"How You Get the Girl\"\n\nDublin, Ireland, June 16\n\n\"If you want to sing along, that would be absolutely glorious,\" Swift encouraged the crowd at her second night at Croke Park. She then smiled her way through a rare, acoustic performance of the 1989 track.\n\n\"So It Goes...\"\n\nLondon, England, June 22\n\nReputation album track \"So It Goes...\" has been noticeably absent from this tour's set list, making Swift's surprise addition to her Wembley Stadium set all the more special. With this acoustic treat, she perhaps hinted at what the song sounded like when she first wrote it.\n\n\"Fifteen\"\n\nLondon, England, June 23\n\nJune 23 marked Swift's fifteenth show on the Reputation Stadium Tour, so what better song to play? The country-pop Fearless single was an early hit for her -- and based on the crowd's reaction, it's still holds a place in fans' hearts.\n\n\"Mine\"\n\nLouisville, Ky., June 30\n\nThe opening track of Speak Now wrapped the June leg of Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour. \"I haven't played this song in so many years, and you're singing it so loud,\" she beamed from the B-stage.\n\n\"Sparks Fly\"\n\nColumbus, Ohio, July 7\n\nKeeping in the tradition of Speak Now, Swift moved onto the pop-country album's second track at her next tour stop. The song, about a classic crush that's so clearly a \"bad idea,\" was written when the singer was a teenager but held its own in a 2018 Taylor Swift set list.\n\n\"State of Grace\"\n\nLandover, Md., July 10\n\nFor the first of two nights in Maryland, Swift harkened back to the \"golden age of something good and right and real\" and the acoustic guitar beginnings of \"State of Grace,\" the opening track on her Red album.\n\nState of Grace + lights \u2b50\ufe0f-- pic.twitter.com/EgJKAnTX6q \u2014 reptourpics (@reptourpics) July 11, 2018\n\n\"Haunted\"\n\nLandover, Md., July 11\n\nThe second Reputation Tour set in Maryland delivered a rare, understated performance of \"Haunted,\" a Speak Now track that hasn't seen Swift's stage much since 2011/2012 -- back when she gave it a decidedly more dramatic treatment.\n\n\"Never Grow Up\"\n\nPhiladelphia, Pa., July 13\n\nBefore strumming the chords of \"Never Grow Up,\" Swift explained that she'd just gone back to visit the nearby farm where she had actually grown up. \"I got especially emotional when I walked into my old bedroom,\" she admitted. She hinted she'd be playing the song with picture of herself in her childhood room on Instagram earlier in the day, and the performance that night took on an especially sentimental tone.\n\n\"Treacherous\"\n\nPhiladelphia, Pa., July 14\n\nAfter some technical difficulties that temporarily left Swift stranded at the main stage rather than floating in her cage over the crowd to the B-stage, she bestowed fans with a highlight from her Red album.\n\n-- | Another clip of Taylor singing Treacherous as the surprise song #repTourPhilly (via @lysst_) pic.twitter.com/Vx0RBjKXra \u2014 Taylor Swift News (@TSwiftNZBU) July 15, 2018\n\n\"Babe\"\n\nCleveland, Ohio, July 17\n\nA concert in Cleveland brought Swift's live debut of \"Babe,\" the Red-era-turned-2018-country-single she penned (with Train's Pat Monahan) that got away -- er, was given away, to Sugarland for their latest album.\n\n\"Welcome to New York\"\n\nEast Rutherford, N.J., July 20\n\nIt was Swift's first show in New Jersey on this tour, but she gave a little shout-out to its neighbor New York with her ode to the loud sounds, bright lights and new beginnings that the big city brings.\n\nTwitter is going to ruin the quality, but here\u2019s welcome to New York!@taylorswift13 @taylornation13 pic.twitter.com/2tqifzR42K \u2014 Bekah (@volcanicheartt) July 21, 2018\n\n\"Fearless\"\n\nEast Rutherford, N.J., July 21\n\nThere's somethin' bout the way a Taylor Swift show feels in the rain, or so they say.

That fan had told the singer how much the song meant to her, and it just so happened that Swift had already been thinking of adding it into her set. The stars aligned on this Friday night as the crowd was treated to a song that hasn't been performed live in years.\n\n\"Ours\"\n\nFoxborough, Mass., July 28\n\n\n\nSwift whipped out another rarity as the surprise B-stage song for her third and final show at Gillette Stadium: \"Ours.\" This concert date marked her tenth time performing at the stadium, where she was also the first female to ever to headline three shows in a row.\n\n\"Out of the Woods\"\n\nToronto, Aug. 3\n\nFor its tour debut, Swift introduced an emotional second bridge to her acoustic performance of 1989 standout \"Out of the Woods.\" \"Remember when we hit the brakes too soon?\" she called out again. \"Twenty stitches in a hospital room. You started crying, I did too.\"\n\nher out of the woods vocals paid all my bills pic.twitter.com/LqZzCJoYF4 \u2014 SARAH ---- // taylor swift -- (@swiftismydrug) August 4, 2018\n\n\"Come Back...

{"label": true, "txt": "Adam Rippon has dropped off his skates and picked up some new dance moves in the opening episode of Season 26 of Dancing With the Stars. This unique short season of the show includes a cast of famous athletes from different disciplines.\n\nThe season has a few winter Olympians such as Tonya Harding, Jamie Anderson, Mirai Nagasu, Chris Mazdzer and of course, Rippon. There are also some team sports players like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and former MLB outfielder Johnny Damon.\n\nIn this first week, the couples dance to the foxtrot, salsa, cha-cha-cha, or the waltz. The couples were evaluated both by the judges and from a live voting audience at home. For the first time in the show, two couples were eliminated on the opening episode. (Spoilers ahead!)\n\nLuckily, Rippon wasn\u2019t one of the two couples. In fact, he was one of the top couples of the week. It\u2019s been a dream for the Olympian to be on the show, so I\u2019m sure it feels great that he performed well.\n\nBefore we get into the dance, we have to talk about his introduction video. The first 10 seconds of the clip where Adam meets his partner, Jenna Johnson, is just them screaming and hugging. \u201cIt was destiny,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cAdam and I, when we first met, I was amazed because I felt like we had known each other for years,\u201d Jenna explained in the clip. \u201cImmediately, there was just a connection and a chemistry.\u201d\n\nI need to get a drink of water before we discuss how amazing his freaking performance was. If I hadn\u2019t seen him plastered all over Twitter for like a month, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell which one was the celebrity and which one was the professional dancer. First off all, they danced to \u201cSissy That Walk.\u201d I don\u2019t know if that was Jenna\u2019s choice or a production decision, but either way, genius move.\n\nWhile technically a cha-cha-cha, the choreography included some voguing moves and runway walking from the couple. Something I noticed in this dance, as compared to others, is that the moves didn\u2019t seem as gendered. The opening, for example, was Adam voguing and walking down a set of stairsvery Beyonc\u00e9 at the Super Bowl. In other performances, we saw the men performing pretty traditional \u201cmale\u201d roles in the couple. With Adam though, we got a lot more variety.\n\nA big condragulations to Adam Rippon and Jenna Johnson. The judges and host, Tom Bergeron, commented on how the couple already feels so synchronized and connected. If this was the opening night, I can\u2019t wait to see what they have planned for the rest of the season."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Cardi B is no stranger to headlines. The Bronx bred rapper has been on the news ever since her debut single \u2018Bodak Yellow\u2019 set the music world on fire.\n\nThe hit single was the first female-sung song to reach #1 on the Hot 100 chart since 1998. \u2018Bodak Yellow\u2019 reigned at the charts for three weeks \u2013 the joint longest by any female in 2017.\n\nHowever, this time she created headlines for a whole new reason. Belcalis Marlenis Almanza, or Cardi B as she is popularly known, has given birth to a baby girl.\n\nShe let the world know through Instagram, revealing the name of the girl, \u2018Kulture Kiari Cephus.\u2019 The caption was set against a nude floral picture of Cardi B.\n\nIs Cardi B Pregnant?\n\n\u201cCardi was so excited to have the baby early and has been nothing but head over heels with her baby girl,\u201d a source shared with a private news agency. \u201cShe had a smooth delivery, and the baby was definitely ready to be here early.\u201d\n\nThis is her first and her beau Offset\u2019s fourth child.\n\nBorn on 10th of July 2018, Kulture has been hidden well beyond the eyes of the paparazzi for all of her existence. However, the rapper is beginning to give her fans a sneak peek into her world of being a mother.\n\nOnly recently she uploaded a video of her baby\u2019s custom-made crib on Instagram to much interest of Hollywood.\n\nBut that\u2019s about it. The rapper has secluded to privacy and is reluctant to share pictures of herself or her baby. The rapper even refused to confront her own cellphone camera.\n\nAs per various reports, Cardi is obsessed with Kulture and is very attached and overprotective. She has only let her family and a few friends see the baby and has been spending a lot of time at home with her husband.\n\nCardi B resorted to Instagram to thank her fans for the overwhelming support that helped her achieve 10 MTV Music Video Award Nominations. However, the video focused on a doll instead of the famous Instagram star herself.\n\nShe stated , \u201c It\u2019s your girl Cardi B. I wish I could show my face right now, but a bitch looks f\u2013ked up in the game. My hair\u2019s f\u2013ked up. My eyes are so dark and puffy. Like, I\u2019m wild pale.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI know I haven\u2019t said anything about it but it\u2019s because I\u2019ve just been so busy, so tired and like in a different world, different dimension.\u201d\n\nFrom rocking the red carpet to refusing to show her face \u2013 the birth of Kulture has signaled a change in the ways of Cardi B.\n\nShe was \u2018ecstatic\u2019 about the whole pregnancy affair and has grown very overprotective and dedicated to her newborn, according to close sources.\n\nComing off the success of her album \u2018Invasion Of Privacy\u2019 which debuted at #1 at the Billboard, the female rapper is fully committed to being an ideal mother, so much that she has rejected the idea of a nanny.\n\n\u2018I have not gotten a nanny yet,\u2019 she said in a video . \u2018I just want to learn how to be a mom. I want to enjoy every single second of it since I\u2019m going back to work.\u2019\n\nCardi B\u2019s Pregnancy Experience\n\nNot everything has been smooth about her road to motherhood though. Cardi B has seen the highs and lows during her pregnancy. Here we will look through the highlights of the time Cardi was pregnant.\n\nFirstly, she was hit by a cheating rumor regarding Offset in December 2017, just two months after he proposed her in a concert. Hackers had released private images of Offset which sparked the rumors. She was in her initial stages of pregnancy at that time.\n\nShe was reportedly upset but asked for privacy and respect from the media. She said, \u201cI\u2019m going to make a decision in my own times with my heart and mind. I don\u2019t need to be rushed or be told what to do.\u201d\n\nThe two made peace and moved on rather affectionately, spotted in the 2018 Grammy\u2019s in January.\n\nThe rapper had said in an interview at the 2018 Grammy Awards that somebody is always saying that she\u2019s pregnant every two weeks. \u201cSo it\u2019s just like, if ya\u2019ll wanna know, ask me, I\u2019ll tell ya,\u201d she added.\n\nShe remained tight-lipped during the whole affair, responding to pregnancy questions by saying she\u2019s getting fat. A reply to a followers question read \u201cNo bitch I\u2019m just getting fat. Let me fat in peace.\u201d\n\nDuring this period Cardi B was attending functions in heavy, well-covered dresses with extravagant frills and puffs that did well to hide the baby bump. While many speculated the reason behind the change in design, for most it was just a fashion tweak.\n\nThe announcement came in April, as she was hosting the SNL Live with actor Chadwick Boseman. Dressed in a skin-tight gown that revealed the baby bump in all its grace, the rapper addressed the world.\n\nIn response to the mean comments, she reiterated her desire for privacy. \u201cThis is why I did not want to say nothing,\u201d she wrote on Instagram. \u201cPeople be so thirsty to scrutinize and try to destroy something that is supposed to be a blessing.\u201d\n\nIn a later interview, she revealed she had some doubts about the whole pregnancy thing. However, she was determined to go on and be a mother. Cardi was recorded saying, \u201cYou know what\u2014I\u2019m a grown woman. I\u2019m 25 years old. I\u2019m a schmillionaire and I\u2019m prepared for this.\u201d\n\nWhile she was setting the industry ablaze previously, she did not stop with pregnancy. Cardi performed at Coachella 2018 along with gracing prestigious events, the Billboard Latin Music Awards and the Met Gala.\n\nIn May, she revealed in an interview that the child is going to be a girl. This revelation was followed by another major revelation.\n\nIn May, Rolling Stone unveiled their cover for the July edition. It showed Offset kissing Cardi\u2019s baby bump. She revealed that the two secretly got married last year.\n\nShe added to the revelation in typical fashion. \u201cWell now since you lil nosey f\u2013ks know at least ya can stop saying I had a baby out of wedlock.\u201d\n\nSince July, Cardi B had dedicated her time and energy to her baby.

{"label": true, "txt": "CLOSE The trailer for the upcoming Spike documentary on the life of actor Heath Ledger has been released. USA TODAY\n\n'I Am Heath Ledger' arrives on Spike TV May 17. (Photo: Karin Catt)\n\nAn untimely death, especially a famous one, can color the truth.\n\nI Am Heath Ledger, a new documentary about the actor supported by his family, dispels one common rumor: The Joker did not bring the Australian actor down.\n\n\u201cHonestly, that\u2019s been the biggest thing for us as a family,\u201d says Kate Ledger, Heath\u2019s elder sister, by phone. \u201cHe had an amazing sense of humor and certainly playing the Joker, for him it was one big gag. He had so much fun doing that. It was actually the exact opposite. There was no doom and gloom. ... That was a shock to me that people even thought that, really.\u201d\n\nThe documentary hits theaters tonight (Wednesday) for one night only in partnership with Fathom Events, and then will air on Spike TV on May 17.\n\nLedger died on Jan. 22, 2008, at age 28 in New York City from an accidental overdose of prescription medication and sleeping aids. The role of the Joker would win him a posthumous Oscar for his work in The Dark Knight in 2009.\n\n\u201cLike many of us, we read all sorts of insinuations online that Heath Ledger was taken down this dark spiral path to the depths of depression from his role as the Joker \u2014 this is the reason why we lost this bright star so early in his life,\u201d says I Am Heath Ledger producer and co-director Derik Murray. \u201cWhat was incredible, what was really quite amazing is that the truth behind that is so polar opposite.\u201d\n\nI Am Heath Ledger begins during Ledger\u2019s youth, utilizing hours of the actor\u2019s own home videos. The film charts his quick rise in Hollywood. Less than a year after moving to Los Angeles, he booked the lead role in the 1999 hit teen rom-com 10 Things I Hate About You opposite Julia Stiles.\n\nThen Ledger pivoted, turning down opportunities like Spider-Man and making films that would lead him to work like Lords of Dogtown and his Oscar-nominated role in Brokeback Mountain.\n\n\u201cAs you see in the documentary, he could have very easily gone down that heartthrob career (path) and done a lot of those roles, and he chose not to right from the very beginning,\" says Kate. \"He wanted to be taken seriously as an actor. He was always in command of what he did. He wouldn\u2019t just do something for the money.\u201d\n\nKate Ledger says filmmakers have been knocking at her family\u2019s door since her brother\u2019s death, but it was the involvement of executive producer Matt Amato, her brother\u2019s close friend, that gave them trust the documentary would be done right.\n\nPlus, they had Michelle Williams\u2019 blessing. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have done anything otherwise,\u201d says Kate, revealing little about Ledger\u2019s ex-girlfriend or their child together, Matilda (now 11), though she confirms the family sees both often. \u201cI love them so much and I\u2019m so protective of them that I don\u2019t like to discuss them. Because it\u2019s very private, their life, and I just like to keep it like that,\u201d she says.\n\nThough Ledger\u2019s parents, directors and friends (including Naomi Watts and Ben Harper) appear in the documentary, Williams does not. \u201cShe just felt she was not ready to be on camera and be talking about Heath, which we respected,\u201d says Murray.\n\nToday, Kate Ledger says dealing with her brother\u2019s death as the world watched nine years ago was indescribable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like two separate things. The shock itself was one thing and dealing with it in the public eyes was completely different \u2014 I actually can\u2019t put it into words and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever be able to,\u201d says Ledger, who has since set up a scholarship in her brother\u2019s name for emerging Australian talent. \u201cNot too many people have to experience that. It\u2019s hard enough to experience losing a loved one (without) doing it in front of everyone else. It\u2019s horrendous.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2pxLZxu"}

{"label": true, "txt": "The final season premiere of Pretty Little Liars is officially underway, and fans are freaking out. This is it , friends. After these 10 episodes , there will be no more shirtless Toby makeout scenes, no more Hanna one-liners\u2014and no more fan theories.\n\nFan theories have become a very important part of the Pretty Little Liars universe. The PLL army uses the gaps between seasons to hypothesize future storylines, romances, and villains. Right now the biggest mystery is unmasking Uber A, but there are other questions PLL needs to answer before the final season ends. Does Toby live? Who is the father of Alison's baby? Do Aria and Ezra get married? Who the hell is making those eerily lifelike face masks?!\n\nHundreds of fan theories exist right now that cover these questions and more. We scoured the Internet for the craziest ones that are still possible given everything that's happened. These 14 are the winners, and\u2014wow\u2014they're all certifiably batshit.\n\nSpencer is Uber A.\n\nPinterest PHOTO: \u00a9ABC Family/courtesy Everett Collection\n\nAs a diehard Pretty Little Liars fan, I find it highly unlikely that one of the five liars is Uber A. But I'm alone on this ship: Every liar has a convincing fan theory on the Internet that positions her as the Big Bad. Even Emily . If this is true, the liar with the most evidence stacked against her is Spencer Hastings\u2014as this very detailed Tumblr theory points out. Red flags went off for fans in season three when Spencer said the lead female character in Basic Instinct was a \"genius\" for writing a novel to cover up her murder. (After Charlotte is murdered, Spencer reveals the way it happened is similar to a scenario she wrote in a college essay. Coincidence? Hell no. There are no coincidences in Rosewood.) The theory also notes the strange costume Spencer donned one year for Halloween: Mary Queen of Scots, the woman who conspired to assassinate Queen Elizabeth I. And then there's Spencer's Radley connection: All of the previous A's have ties to the mental institution, and she's the only liar who spent time there as a patient.\n\nToby dies, and his organs are used to save Spencer's life.\n\nPinterest PHOTO: \u00a9ABC Family/courtesy Everett Collection\n\nIf you remember from season 7A's explosive finale, Spencer is rushed to the hospital with a gunshot wound, and Toby gets involved in a gnarly car accident that leaves him unconscious. This theory suggests that Toby, tragically, dies from that accident, but his organs are used to save Spencer's life. (This is also contingent on Spencer suffering from a physical ailment that only Toby's exact organs can help fix.) It sounds far-fetched, but remember this show set Aria on fire. Anything is possible.\n\nAlison killed Charlotte.\n\nPinterest PHOTO: \u00a9ABC Family/courtesy Everett Collection\n\nI know what you're thinking: Alison is Charlotte's sister, and she was the most heartbroken after her murder. But what if Alison's crocodile tears were just an act to mask the truth: She killed Charlotte? This Tumblr post outlines a pretty convincing case for this, and the main evidence is Alison's personality. At one point Ali was a classic mean girl and master manipulator who fat-shamed her friends. Yes, it seems she's turned over a new leaf, but those puppeteering skills are still in her somewhere. You could argue that Charlotte is the reason why Alison had to disappear, which would give her motive.\n\nWilden is Hanna's father.\n\nPinterest PHOTO: \u00a9ABC Family/courtesy Everett Collection\n\nYes, someone in the PLL army thinks the now-deceased Detective Wilden is Hanna's biological father . The support for this theory is thin at best, but that doesn't make it any less interesting. This fan first points to Wilden's treatment of Hanna versus the other girls: He was noticeably less rude and aggressive toward her. Is that because he has a soft (and biological) spot for her? There's also A.D.'s particularly strong vendetta against Alison to consider. It's been assumed for seasons that Wilden was a part of the A gang. So it's possible that Wilden resented the hell Alison put Hanna through in her teenage years and got his revenge as A. Finally, Grunwald told Hanna that the threat against her is \"very close.\" Fans originally thought this meant proximity because Noel Kahn was right behind Hanna as Grunwald said this. But what if \"close\" means something else entirely\u2014like family?\n\nAlison is carrying Emily's baby.\n\nPinterest PHOTO: \u00a9ABC Family/courtesy Everett Collection\n\nWe posted about this theory months ago, but it still holds water. In the season 7A finale, we found out that Alison is pregnant. She claims that Archer (her dead ex-husband) is the father, but what if something else is at play? Remember when Emily harvested her eggs earlier that season? Well, some fans think those eggs (which were stolen) somehow got implanted into Ali. We'll let this one marinate for a second.\n\nCaleb is Uber A.\n\nPinterest PHOTO: \u00a9ABC Family/courtesy Everett Collection\n\nIf you think about it, he's the perfect villain. Teen Vogue points out that Caleb's family history is ambiguous, so the PLL writers have the opportunity to weave him into the DiLaurentis/Drake/Hastings web. Caleb also has the computer skills to pull off the techno trickery A has been doing for years. Plus, he's the only PLL guy who hasn't been accused of being A. Has he been flying under the radar this entire time?!\n\nHanna is psychic.\n\nPinterest PHOTO: \u00a9ABC Family/courtesy Everett Collection\n\nHanna had two dreams on the show in earlier seasons where she was told things she shouldn't have known. When she was kidnapped, for example, Spencer came to her in a dream and told her how to escape A.D. But here's the problem: The liars only learned about A.D. after Hanna was taken, so how did her subconscious know that name? Hanna also dreamt that Alison told her a story about Noel Kahn pushing someone down the stairs. When she mentioned this the next day to her friends, Alison's expression suggested the story was true. Naturally, these dreams have several fans certain that Hanna is clairvoyant . Truthfully, I'm here for this. Hanna has always been magical, so it's only fitting that she's some kind of psychic.\n\nMaya is still alive.\n\nPinterest PHOTO: Freeform/ABC Family\n\nEmily/Maya 'shippers will love this theory, which has some merit. The PLL fan who wrote this one points out that we never actually saw Maya's dead body\u2014just a body bag. Also, Nate/Lyndon James (Maya's alleged killer) never confessed to the crime, so we have no real confirmation that she's dead. Alison's fake death and Maya's supposedly \"real\" death go down in eerily similar ways, too: body bags, police cars\u2014even the music is the same in both scenes. Could, Maya's death, like Alison's, be staged?\n\n\"The Jenna Thing\" wasn't an accident.\n\nPinterest PHOTO: \u00a9ABC Family/courtesy Everett Collection\n\nOne of the first lies the girls have to cover up in the series is what they did to Jenna. (If you forgot, Alison threw a firework over Jenna's fence, which ultimately blinded her.) The girls claim this was just a harmless prank gone too far, but what if this isn't the whole story? A Reddit user named mizkelton16 is convinced that blinding Jenna wasn't an accident. It's obvious that Alison was receiving texts from A long before the other girls, so mizkelton16 alleges that hurting Jenna was one of the villain's first demands. This could explain why Alison disappeared too: Maybe she got too scared of A's power and ran off?\n\nHanna's mother is Uber A.\n\nPinterest PHOTO: \u00a9ABC Family/courtesy Everett Collection\n\nCould Ashley Marin be the brains behind this entire twisted operation? It's a devastating thought\u2014Hanna is her daughter\u2014but it's plausible. This video neatly outlines all of the indicators that Ashley is the Big Bad. One obvious clue is her first initial: A. Plus, the \"Ashley is Uber A\" theory fits into Grunwald's prediction that the liars' main threat is close to Hanna. Ashley also has a vested interest in Radley (she turned the hospital into a hotel), and we know from past A's that Radley is a big part of the game. This would honestly bring new meaning to the term \"Mommie Dearest.\"\n\nEliza, the Amish girl, is Alison and Wilden's child.\n\nHere's another theory that's highly improbable but so, so juicy. In the seventh season, we were introduced to a little Amish girl named Eliza, who for some reason owns dolls made in the likeness of the liars. This could be a strange coincidence, but this Reddit user thinks Eliza is the daughter of one of the liars\u2014specfically Alison. Her reasoning? Alison is a huge fan of Audrey Hepburn movies, which we realized on two occasions: The first was when Ezra referred to Alison as his Holly Golightly. The second was a little more sinister: The episode where Alison was wrongfully found guilty of Mona's murder is titled \"I'm a Good Girl, I Am,\" which is a hat tip to Hepburn's film My Fair Lady . And who did Hepburn play in My Fair Lady ? Eliza Doolittle. Also, Eliza's assumed age range matches the time between Alison's disappearance and return. Did Ali run away because she was pregnant? Ehhh, maybe .\n\nAria is Uber A.\n\nPinterest PHOTO: \u00a9ABC Family/courtesy Everett Collection\n\nAt one point everyone thought Aria was Uber A, but now fans are a little more skeptical. Nevertheless, it's a valid theory. This video highlights the fact that Mary Drake could be Aria's mother, which would make her initials A.D. Plus, A.D. only stole Aria and Noel's files from Jessica's basement; Noel is a confirmed member of the A gang, so does this mean Aria is involved too? There's also a hypothesis floating around that Aria's father is her Uncle Scott, who has mental health issues and spent time in Radley (again, the Radley connection is key). Plus, Aria's handwriting matches A's and she owns, like, a thousand phones. Owning 12,000 iPhones is a total Uber A move.\n\nBethany Young is also Mary Drake's daughter.\n\nAfter fans learned that Spencer is Mary Drake's biological daughter, they started speculating about her other possible children. The most popular theory is that Bethany Young (the girl whose dead body was incorrectly identified as Alison's) is also Mary's daughter. The proof? Alison and Bethany's uncanny resemblance caused police officers to mix them up. Is that because they're cousins and share DNA? Also, Jessica DiLaurentis (Mary's sister) insisted that Bethany call her Aunt Jessie. Was this just a term of endearment\u2014or was Jessica actually Bethany's aunt?\n\nSpencer has an identical twin who is A.D.\n\nPinterest PHOTO: \u00a9ABC Family/courtesy Everett Collection\n\nA quote from PLL creator I. Marlene King is fans' biggest fuel for this truly nuts theory: \"Uber A is the smartest of all the A's, the most intense of all the A's, the most driven to win the game of all the A's. And I can\u2019t tell you if you\u2019ve seen the person before or not because that might spoil something a little bit later down the line.\" Who is smarter than Spencer Hastings? Answer: Spencer Hastings' twin who somehow managed to hide in plain sight this entire time\u2014obviously.\n\nWe'll find out the answers to these questions (and more) during Pretty Little Liars final season, airing Tuesdays at 8:00 P.M. ET on Freeform."}
{"label": true, "txt": "Jennifer Lawrence in the ballet scene from Red Sparrow. Red Sparrow may not be a dance movie, but ballet \u2013 its single-mindedness \u2013 permeates it. In this dark spy thriller, directed by Francis Lawrence and based on the 2013 novel of the same name by Jason Matthews, Jennifer Lawrence plays Dominika Egorova, a Russian ballerina who has to retire from the stage \u2013 and here comes a spoiler, which is easier to read about than to watch \u2013 after her partner leaps into the air and crashes onto her leg. It's a career-ender. Forced to become a spy whose specialty is the art of seduction, Dominika finds that her ballet past helps. She has discipline, athleticism, ambition. She knows how to act. For Francis Lawrence, who is not related to Jennifer Lawrence but has directed her in three Hunger Games films, having his star engage in intense ballet training wasn't only about dancing. It helped to define her character. The opening scene showcases Peck's ballet, performed by members of the Hungarian National Ballet and inspired by The Firebird. (The dance scenes were shot at the Hungarian State Opera House in Budapest.) Instead of using Stravinsky's timeless music, it is set to an original score by James Newton Howard. \"Justin was the creative collaborator, and Kurt was the one who took on the physical aspects of really working with Jen,\" Francis Lawrence said. (Jennifer Lawrence also worked with Russian ballet coach Olga Kostritzky.)\n\nForced to become a spy whose specialty is the art of seduction, Dominika finds that her ballet past helps. Credit:Murray Close Froman is \"the ballet-boot-camp guy, and in a great way,\" Francis Lawrence said. \"He knows how to teach ballet to lay people, to ease them in as best as possible.\" And he knows their limits, Lawrence added. \"He was the one who told me: 'Jen will never get up on pointe. It's too dangerous.'\" Jennifer Lawrence has danced before on film, memorably in a duet with Bradley Cooper in Silver Linings Playbook. But while it was a delight, the number, despite a couple of harrowing lifts, had little in common with ballet. Jennifer Lawrence plays Dominika Egorova, a Russian ballerina who has to retire from the stage. Credit:MURRAY CLOSE Though only Lawrence's upper body is what is shown in the Red Sparrow sequence, she learned all the choreography, which, Froman said, was not created with a beginner in mind. She had to hit the rise and fall of the movement, essentially matching Boylston - if not in quality than in dynamics and with the correct paulement, or placement of the shoulders.\n\nFor three and a half months, Froman worked with Lawrence \u2013 mainly in her garage in Los Angeles \u2013 for four hours a day, five days a week. They started with stretching and working with discs to help Lawrence grasp turnout, or the opening of the legs from the hips. \"I wanted her to understand what muscle groups were involved, and how most people walking on the street are internally rotated with their shoulders \u2013 their palms are facing back,\" Froman said. \"With ballet dancers, you have to spin that back so it looks more like their arms are an extension of their back, and that whole alignment lengthens your neck. It widens your shoulder line.\" Froman made her hold a ball to bring awareness to her arm. \"When there's weight in it and when you're activating those fingers, it's different than just having your arm as a prop or lifeless,\" he said. \"By the time we started working on choreography, she had beautiful hands and a really nice neck and shoulders.\" And he didn't make the exercises easy. \"Even for an actor, they have to understand this world,\" he said. \"It's almost like a religion. Every day there's a checklist going through your head: Where's my centre of gravity? Are my ribs closed?\" During the filming, Froman stood behind the camera facing Lawrence instead of using a microphone as he talked her through the movement. \"I wanted it to be just between the two of us,\" he said. \"Immediately, she performed exactly the quality of work that we had rehearsed. It didn't all go out the window because of nerves.\"\n\nIn the end, the ballet sequence relies on visual effects, with a combination of shots featuring Lawrence and Boylston. Polunin, who plays Dominika's dance partner, said Lawrence possessed \"a ballerina's energy\". \"It's different than what a normal person has,\" he said. \"There's a tight feeling inside. It's the muscle compression and wanting to be perfect. She had that.\" After Sarah Lane, then a Ballet Theater soloist, performed as Portman's dance double in Black Swan, a controversy erupted; Lane didn't feel she was getting the credit she deserved and went public. Why would Boylston, a ballerina at the top of her game, want to be a dance double? She wanted to work with Peck, she said, adding, \"Any opportunity to help bring ballet to a larger audience is something to be capitalised on.\" Francis Lawrence said he never wanted to hide that they were using a double, \"and stand around in interviews going, 'No, no, no \u2013 Jen did all the training herself.'\" Froman realised that dancing next to Boylston could make just about anyone feel vulnerable. Jennifer Lawrence \"trusted the fact that I would tell her something didn't look good or not,\" Froman said.\n\n\"I'm at my happiest working with a dancer or an actor \u2013 I want it to feel participatory, I want it to feel collaborative, and I want to hear their ideas,\" he said. \"I'm in this line of work to give it away and to empower. I had to be there for Jen.\" The New York Times"}

{"label": true, "txt": "If you don\u2019t know Sundance from TIFF, or the Golden Globes from the SAG Awards, this exhaustive guide will give you all the answers.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know Sundance from TIFF, or the Golden Globes from the SAG Awards, this exhaustive guide will give you all the answers.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know Sundance from TIFF, or the Golden Globes from the SAG Awards, this exhaustive guide will give you all the answers.\n\nSo you want to learn about awards season, the never-ending footrace that annually dominates, terrorizes, and energizes the film industry. When does the season actually begin, and when does it end? What\u2019s the purpose of all those film festivals in faraway locales? What goes into an Oscar campaign, and why, exactly, must Oscars be campaigned for in the first place? What makes the Oscars so all-encompassingly important for movies, anyway?\n\nThe answers you seek can be found below\u2014starting with a definition of what we mean by \u201cawards season\u201d in the first place.\n\nTHE TIME FRAME\n\nThe truth is that for the movie industry, awards season never really ends. When one Oscar ceremony concludes, insiders immediately begin plotting for the next cycle\u2014and so on and so forth. It\u2019s like an election, except they prepare to run for president every year, instead of every four.\n\nThe more targeted answer is that awards season generally kicks off in September, and ends, of course, with the Oscars\u2014i.e. the Academy Awards, presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, more commonly known as the Academy. The Oscars are usually held in late February or early March\u2014though that will change in 2020.\n\nWHY SEPTEMBER?\n\nTo make sure everyone in the Academy remembers your movie during the Oscar-voting window, of course. Feature-length films are eligible for Oscars if they screen theatrically between January 1 and December 31 of a given year. (So the Oscars held in 2019 actually honor the best films of 2018.) Nomination-round voting lasts for one week in January.\n\nGiven that, studios usually release their best movies in the fall, in order to ensure that voters won\u2019t forget about them before voting begins. Many opt for a prime Thanksgiving or December 25 slot\u2014which allows a movie to get holiday spending bucks and be the freshest film on an Academy member\u2019s mind right before they vote. This timing explains why good movie options are so hard to find at the start of the new year, and why movies like Get Out, which was released in February 2017\u2014an entire year before the Oscars for which it was eligible\u2014are anomalies. It\u2019s typically impossible for a film to maintain hype for an entire calendar year.\n\nTo get even more specific: awards season really, truly begins with the Toronto International Film Festival, which takes place in early September. That competition, with its convenient date and easy access for North American media and industry types, has become known as an event that separates awards wheat from the chaff. But more on that below.\n\nTHE FESTIVALS\n\nThese film competitions are where the biggest projects typically make their debut and vie for early attention. Here are some key fests to know:\n\nIllustration by Lauren Tamaki.\n\nSundance\n\nFounded in 1978 as the U.S. Film Festival, and taken over by Robert Redford in 1985 and renamed in 1991, the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, was once a wild, snow-covered playground for scrappy indies by future auteurs (Steven Soderbergh, Quentin Tarantino). The fest takes place in January and is the first major competition of the calendar year, giving industry figures and film fans alike a chance to scope out the movies that could shape the narrative and break big, once they secure distribution for later in the year.\n\nSpeaking of: Sundance also gives indies a chance to make eye-popping deals. In 2017, streaming services like Amazon and Netflix went on rampant buying sprees, throwing money around in the hopes of landing projects that could carry them all the way to Oscar glory. (Among other movies, Amazon acquired Manchester by the Sea, which did go on to land a best-picture nomination\u2014and a best-actor win.) Both companies have cooled on Sundance a bit in the last year, however, which has pundits wondering if the festival has lost its awards-bait spark\u2014though that would not necessarily be a bad thing. Still, Sundance has cachet, and it always draws both veterans and rising stars\u2014all of whom gladly trudge through snow to check out the films that will (hopefully) be among the best of the year.\n\nIllustration by Lauren Tamaki.\n\nBerlin International Film Festival\n\nThe 10-day festival, usually called the Berlinale, kicks off in Berlin, Germany, each February, drawing a global crowd of stars, critics, and film fans. Founded in 1951, the festival is typically presided over by a select international jury of about six to eight luminaries; the 2018 jury president was director Tom Tykwer. Competitors fight for the Goldener B\u00e4r (i.e. the Golden Bear). Like most other international festivals, Berlinale doesn\u2019t quite predict Oscar winners\u2014but it does alert cinephiles to international releases worth watching. The 2017 festival, for example, included the premiere of A Fantastic Woman, the surreal Chilean drama that went on to win the best-foreign-language Oscar.\n\nIllustration by Lauren Tamaki.\n\nCannes\n\nThe opulent French fest, which takes place in May, is the haute couture, diamond-lined gown of film festivals. Even people who aren\u2019t familiar with it would likely recognize its trademark red carpet (where attendees are not allowed to take selfies), a grandiose setting that leads to the Grand Palais. Much like Berlin, an appearance at Cannes doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to Oscars\u2014though it is a prestigious honor in its own right for a filmmaker to pick up the event\u2019s top prize, the Palme d\u2019Or, which is selected by a small jury headed up by a group of film figures. (The 2018 jury president was Cate Blanchett.)\n\nCannes is also a good playground for international films, putting a spotlight on the best releases from around the world, as well as a hot spot for distributors, though the frenzy it once inspired has since dwindled. Cannes\u2019s overall reputation has been damaged due to outdated rules, including that women must wear heels on the red carpet, and that movies that will stream but will not be released theatrically aren\u2019t allowed in the competition. (The snobbishness of this rule is debatable, depending on whether you believe that Netflix is destroying or saving the movie business.)\n\nVenice\n\nThe Venice International Film Festival, which takes place this year from August 29 to September 8, is the oldest film festival in the world and retains an appropriately prestigious reputation. And unlike Cannes, there is a direct correlation between screening at the Italian event and Oscar performance\u2014perhaps because Venice takes place closer to fall. Over the last few years, the films that opened the festival\u2014including Gravity, Birdman, and La La Land\u2014have gone on to pick up a slew of statuettes. This year\u2019s lucky opener? First Man, by Damien Chazelle. He\u2019ll also be competing for the festival\u2019s highest honor, the Leone d\u2019Oro (the Golden Lion).\n\nIllustration by Lauren Tamaki.\n\nToronto\n\nAh, TIFF. The Canadian festival, powered by oodles of poutine and attended by critics, stars, and enthusiastic film fans, starts in September (this year from Sept. 6 to Sept. 16), and, unofficially, sets the Oscar narrative for the year. Thanks to its convenient date and accessible North American setting, TIFF has long been the fest that Hollywood looks to in order to get a better read on which movies are going to make it all the way to the Oscars. TIFF takes place over 10 days and screens hundreds of movies, a mix of pure prestige and films with populist appeal. This year\u2019s lineup includes the Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet vehicle Beautiful Boy and Barry Jenkins\u2019s If Beale Street Could Talk, both of which have already garnered warm reviews. Let the buzz begin . . .\n\nIllustration by Lauren Tamaki.\n\nTelluride\n\nWhile other festivals can boast visibility and scope, this Telluride, Colorado, event is much more intimate, set against a gorgeous mountain backdrop. Telluride takes place over the course of four days\u2014this year, it went from August 31 to September 3\u2014and draws a mix of filmmakers, critics, pundits, and more, who come for its secretly selected lineup and variety of seminars and conversations with talked-about stars. Like TIFF, which begins right afterward, Telluride is another festival to keep your eyes on, if you want to know which movies are going to have a busy awards season. Per Variety, it\u2019s hosted seven of the last eight best-picture winners, giving five of them world premieres. Not bad for a fest that only has a few dozen films in its main lineup.\n\nNaturally, there are dozens more festivals to keep your eyes on, from the 56-year-old New York Film Festival, with its reliable, distinguished main slate, to the poppy SXSW Film Festival and the Switzerland-based Locarno Festival. Each one has its quirks and its perks, but only a few set the course for the season.\n\nTHE CAMPAIGNS\n\nIf this world were pure, Oscar wins would always be strictly merit-based. But because there are just too many movies fighting for headspace, and too much money riding on the movies and stars that land top honors\u2014and, of course, because films are not an objective art\u2014winning a statuette means fighting all the way to Oscar night.\n\nIf you are an actor and your performance has awards potential, you spend awards season doing the following: frequently flying between New York and Los Angeles to attend private screenings and do Q&As for Academy members; showing up at every luncheon and awards ceremony and gala of note, sometimes multiple ones a day (which requires a pricey and savvy stylist, lest you be photographed in the same thing twice and miss the opportunity to become a fashion icon en route to Oscar gold, \u00e0 la Lupita Nyong\u2019o; and sitting for near-daily interviews with reporters for radio, online, video, and magazine pieces, hopefully even nabbing a cover or two.\n\nIf you\u2019re Melissa Leo, you\u2019re also posing for your own \u201cFor Your Consideration\u201d ads\u2014i.e. campaign ads directly geared toward industry voters, and more traditionally put out by studios. They will likely appear online, on billboards, and in the glossy pages of trade publications like Variety and The Hollywood Reporter, for a tidy sum: billboards can cost up to approximately $25,000 a month, while a full-page trade placement could be around $70,000. Those ads are augmented by DVD screeners that are sent out to voters and influencers, so that they can watch Oscar-hopeful films from the comfort of their own homes. All told, studios can spend up to $10 million vigorously promoting a potential award winner.\n\nNo awards-push conversation is complete without hat-tipping the publicists who are pulling strings behind the scenes. They are tough, exacting generals with a friendly veneer, who spend awards season mindfully hovering over interviews, scheduling every little thing, prodding their clients down red carpets, and watching out for any hurdles that could damage a campaign (like, say, an old scandal that comes back to rear its ugly head, or an off-the-rails interview destined to go terribly viral). Plenty of publicists have become famous for successfully guiding clients down the awards track; see, for instance, Peggy Siegal, heralded most recently for helping Leonardo DiCaprio finally secure his Oscar. (And boy, did he have to fight for it, serving face time at 53 red carpet events that year alone.)\n\nBeyond publicists, there are also dedicated awards-season strategists who focus solely on helping studios and streaming platforms worm their way into the awards conversation. Disney, for example, has hired Cynthia Swartz to help get Black Panther into the best-picture race), while Netflix has hired Lisa Taback, a former Weinstein Company honcho who has since lent her services to the successful campaigns for both La La Land and Moonlight.\n\nSpeaking of . . . you can\u2019t really talk about the madness of awards campaigns without mentioning the brothers Weinstein, particularly Harvey (who was run out of the business in 2017 after being accused of sexual misconduct by more than 80 women; he has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex). Harvey was so untouchable for so long, in large part because he was known for masterminding aggressive awards campaigns\u2014and getting results. His pugnacious tactics flew in the face of the notion that moneyed studios will edge out indies every time, and forever changed the way that Oscar campaigns are waged\u2014which is why he\u2019s among the most-thanked people in Oscar history.\n\nJust take a look at Weinstein\u2019s very first big campaign, in 1990, for My Left Foot. To get voter attention, he orchestrated meet-and-greets with the film\u2019s team, organized screenings that were strategically close to where members lived and went on vacation (Los Angeles, Hawaii, Aspen), and sent Daniel Day-Lewis to Washington, D.C., to show his support for the Americans with Disabilities Act, as his character in the film has cerebral palsy. The film was nominated for five Oscars, winning two for best actor (Day-Lewis) and best supporting actress (Brenda Fricker). With time, Weinstein\u2019s stunts only grew bigger and more notorious\u2014more strategic parties, more smear campaigns against competitors, and more personal calls to Academy members to ensure as many votes as humanly possible. He turned campaigning into a vicious contact sport, which is how it largely remains today. (Though no one else appears to be as notorious as Weinstein.)\n\nIn recent years, the Academy has attempted to curtail out-of-control campaigning with specific regulations, such as forcing hopefuls to send screeners via an Academy-approved mailing house, and limiting the number of screenings that members can attend for certain films. But forcing hopefuls to jump through a few extra hoops won\u2019t stop the beast that is campaigning.\n\nIllustration by Lauren Tamaki.\n\nTHE AWARDS\n\nBefore nabbing an Oscar, hopefuls compete in a variety of lead-up contests, including but not limited to these key ceremonies:\n\nNational Board of Review Gala:\n\nEstablished in 1909, the National Board of Review is a prestigious body whose voting members include a select group of students, \u201cfilm enthusiasts, filmmakers, professionals, and academics.\u201d They vote on all the usual categories (best film, director, etc.), in addition to categories like best breakthrough performance and the freedom of expression award. The winners are then announced online, typically in late November or early December. The New York-based gala, which is not televised, takes place in January, drawing stars and press alike to a ceremony where nerves are not quite as high, since everyone knows the winners ahead of time.\n\nThe N.B.R. is an idiosyncratic awards body, as the winners often don\u2019t line up with the eventual Oscar winners. Take 2017, for example. The N.B.R. lavished The Post with best picture, best actor (Tom Hanks), and best actress (Meryl Streep). Meanwhile, the film went home empty-handed at this year\u2019s Academy Awards. The N.B.R. tends to do its own thing, which makes it a nice surprise in an awards season that often rewards the same front-runners over and over.\n\nGolden Globes:\n\nBetter known as the televised ceremony where the champagne flows freely, the stars get drunk, and the voting body\u2014the Hollywood Foreign Press Association\u2014picks predictably unpredictable winners. The Golden Globes are typically the first major televised ceremony of the calendar year, taking place in January. It\u2019s an incredibly glitzy affair celebrating the best in both film and TV, drawing a wide swath of the industry who turn up for the booze-fueled party, usually hosted by a big star (in past years: Ricky Gervais, Tina Fey, and Amy Poehler). Like the N.B.R., the Globes don\u2019t correlate very well with the Oscars, likely because the H.F.P.A. is also idiosyncratic: the somewhat mysterious voting body is made up of 90 or so foreign journalists working for global outlets, but based in Southern California.\n\nThe Globes set themselves apart by splitting films into categories like best musical or comedy (an increasingly outdated designation) and best drama. There are also special honors like the Cecil B. DeMille award, which has gone to luminaries like Oprah Winfrey and Streep, both of whom sizzled prime time with rousing speeches. The trademark of the ceremony is its sometimes-erratic nominations and winners (The Martian for best comedy! The Tourist for, well, anything); the key to loving \u2019em is not taking any of it too seriously. But for the winners, it\u2019s a nice moment of high visibility in a blur of an awards season.\n\nFilm Independent Spirit Awards:\n\nThis ceremony, which usually takes place the day before the Oscars, turns its cheek away from polished studio offerings, instead honoring the best independent releases of the season. The ceremony typically takes place in a decked-out tent by the Santa Monica Pier, an arty reprieve from stuffy ballrooms and gilded auditoriums. While it\u2019s not as prestigious as the Oscars, this ceremony draws big-name artists who come in the name of celebrating independent cinema. It\u2019s also a great opportunity for tiny, beautiful movies to get much-needed recognition that they can\u2019t count on from the Academy. There are also a number of hyper-specific honors, from the John Cassavetes Award to the newly established Bonnie Award, which honors mid-career women directors; the inaugural recipient was Chlo\u00e9 Zhao. Winners are voted on by a body that includes a mix of directors, actors, writers, and critics, among others, as well as the organization\u2019s board of directors.\n\nThe Golden Raspberry Awards:\n\nAmid all the prestige and hype are the Razzies, as they\u2019re commonly called, the ceremony dedicated to honoring the very worst films and performances of the year. Founded in 1981, the ceremony has ebbed and flowed in the public consciousness, gaining steam when stars like Halle Berry and Sandra Bullock pop by to poke fun at themselves and pick up their dishonorable prizes. The voting body for the Razzies is comprised of anyone willing to spend $40 on a membership.\n\nAll of the Guilds\n\nThese are the awards voted on by peers, for peers\u2014in groups including the Directors Guild of America, the Producers Guild of America, and the Writers Guild of America. Each separate association holds its own tony ceremony, though the flashiest of all is the Screen Actors Guild Awards, a televised ceremony that takes place in late January and draws the biggest performers. Here, many winners lovingly dedicate their acceptance speeches to their fellow thespians, in between telling glow-up stories about what it was like to get their precious SAG cards.\n\nCritics\u2019 Pick\n\nThe season also contains its share of awards voted by critics, for critics (er, for the critics\u2019 peace of mind). The main ones to follow are the New York Film Critics Circle, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, and, biggest of all, the Critics\u2019 Choice Awards. The latter is a televised ceremony that usually takes place in mid-January and honors both film and television. It\u2019s a splashy way for the critics to make their two cents known on a grand scale; its voting bodies consist of the BFCA (Broadcast Film Critics Association, which boasts around 300 critics) and BTJA (the Broadcast Television Journalists Association). It should come as no surprise that, for the most part, the critics end up selecting spot-on nominees; this past year, every core-category winner\u2014including best picture, director, actor, and actress\u2014lined up exactly with the Oscars.\n\nTHE ACADEMY AWARDS\n\nBehold, the alpha and the omega, the ceremony that glues this entire industry together: the Academy Awards. The event is presided over by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which was spearheaded by MGM studio chief Louis B. Mayer in 1927. Originally conceived as a way to benefit the industry, the Academy was soon established as a nonprofit organization with five branches: actors, directors, writers, producers, and technicians. The first Academy Awards took place in 1929; the prize, a solid bronze, 24-karat gold-plated statuette of a knight holding a sword and standing on a reel of film, was originally called the Academy Award of Merit, but later picked up a little nickname: Oscar.\n\nWhy Oscar? Potential origin stories run the gamut, but three particularly strong ones reign. The first is that Academy librarian-turned-executive director Margaret Herrick said that the statue looked like her Uncle Oscar. The second is that Hollywood columnist Sidney Skolsky, inspired by an old vaudeville joke, started calling the prize Oscar after getting bored with writing \u201cthe gold statue of the Academy\u201d in his columns. The third comes from Bette Davis, who said the statuette\u2019s rear end resembled that of her husband\u2019s at the time, whose middle name was Oscar.\n\nWhen people refer to the Academy Awards, they\u2019re typically talking about the big, televised ceremony that happens in late February or early March. But the Academy also hands out other awards given at separate ceremonies. First, there are the Governors Awards (so named because they\u2019re selected by the Academy\u2019s board), which present honorary statuettes in three categories: the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award (given to producers), the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award (given to stars whose humanitarianism has benefited the industry), and the Honorary Award (for lifetime achievement). The awards, whose winners are pre-announced in September, are presented in November at a black-tie gala; tiny snippets of the acceptance speeches are featured during the big Oscar telecast.\n\nThere\u2019s also the Sci-Tech Awards, which honor the best in film innovation via categories including the Technical Achievement Award, the Scientific and Engineering Award, and Academy Award of Merit. Unlike the Oscars, winners here aren\u2019t always given a knightly statuette; instead, winners in those first two categories are awarded a certificate and a bronze tablet, respectively. The victors are announced prior to the ceremony, which takes place in the weeks before the Big Oscars.\n\nLast but not least are the Student Academy Awards, an international film competition that rewards college and university students around the world who submit animated, documentary, and narrative works. These awards take an Olympic twist, as contestants are fighting to win a gold, silver, or bronze medal (and lifelong bragging rights). Fifteen winners were selected at the 2017 Student Academy Awards. It\u2019s nice company to be in, as past winners have included Spike Lee and Robert Zemeckis.\n\nWhy do the Oscars matter so much?:\n\nIf you\u2019re one of those superior beings who thinks that film competitions actually don\u2019t matter, because art is too subjective to judge\u2014then, my god, what are you even doing here?\n\nIf you\u2019re not: barring all grandiose, philosophical reasoning, the Oscars matter because they are the industry\u2019s biggest and glitziest way to celebrate the best movies of the year, as selected by elites across various cinematic fields. They\u2019re a way to recognize movies beyond the box office. And the reverse is true as well: if a small film gets Oscars attention, it can get a healthy boost at the box office, thus extending the life and legacy of said film. Which, in turn, is priceless.\n\nWhat\u2019s eligible?:\n\nThe rules vary from category to category, but for feature-length movies, it boils down to a central rule: they must be released in theaters before December 31. Quite a few categories have further, more specific requirements, including best animated feature, short (animated or live action), documentary, doc short, foreign-language film, original song, and score. That last category caused a bit of controversy in 2016, after expected nominees Arrival, Manchester by the Sea, and Silence were all disqualified, because they apparently used too much pre-existing music\u2014to the point where the Academy determined that listeners would not be able to distinguish those selections from each film\u2019s original score cues. The lesson here? Read those eligibility rules carefully, because once decisions are made, they\u2019re final.\n\nWho picks the nominees and winners?:\n\nThe voting body for the Academy Awards is comprised of more than 7,000 members across various practices (or \u201cbranches\u201d), including actors, writers, directors, and cinematographers. There are only a few ways to get into the Academy; either you gain membership after being nominated for or winning an Oscar, or you can be sponsored by two current Academy members. From there, the qualifications for a potential candidate vary from branch to branch.\n\nIn theory, the Academy is made up of the best of the best in the industry (another reason the award is so prestigious and competitive), and its members represent a wide swath of professions. In reality, the makeup of its voting body has long been a source of problems for the Academy. In 2012, the Los Angeles Times revealed that an overwhelming percentage of Oscar voters were white men\u2014and a homogeneous pool is a great way to get a homogeneous group of winners, therefore creating a homogenized film canon. This lack of inclusivity came under fire in 2015, when every single Oscar acting nominee was, like so many years before, white\u2014leading to the viral hashtag #OscarsSoWhite, created by April Reign.\n\nThe Academy, under the guidance of former president Cheryl Boone Isaacs, has attempted to rectify its lack of inclusivity by widening its member invitation pool and imposing new rules on how long a member can retain voting status, all with the goal of doubling the number of diverse members by 2020.\n\nHow does voting work?:\n\nAfter the nominations are announced, voters get a week to choose their final favorites. (In 2019, they will have from February 12 to February 19.) Members vote via paper or online ballots. Sounds simple enough\u2014except, that is, when you\u2019re voting for best picture. Instead of just picking their favorite movie, voters have to rank all nominated films in order, from their favorite to their least favorite. PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting firm that\u2019s tallied Oscar votes for decades\u2014and will continue to do so, despite recent challenges\u2014then has its accountants go through and kick out the movie that gets the least votes overall, repeating this process until they end up with the film with the most votes overall. Thus, the win doesn\u2019t always go to the movie with the most first-place votes. The best-picture statuette is given to a selection of the film\u2019s producers, by the way.\n\nWhat happens after you win?:\n\nWhy, you get a little gold man on your mantel forevermore. You get the prefix \u201cOscar winner\u201d permanently attached to your name. Honor, glory\u2014all that. But there are also tangible financial benefits. Movies that win best picture typically experience an \u201cOscar bump,\u201d a major increase in box-office ticket sales. Take 2017 winner Moonlight, for example. In one post-Oscars weekend, the film earned an extra $2.5 million in sales, easily doubling its slim $1.5 million budget. Actors can also (often, but not always) land red-hot roles thanks to the their newfound prestige. In addition, winners get an invitation to the Academy\u2014keeping the tradition going forever and ever and ever . . ."}

{"label": true, "txt": "With their announcement that they are going to marry, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are making history in several ways.\n\nFor one thing, Markle, 36, isn\u2019t the daughter of a grand aristocratic family, nor is she even British. Rather, she\u2019s an American TV actress and a divorcee.\n\nIn this way, the Los Angeles-reared Markle will be the first American whose marriage to a member of the royal family will be embraced by the \u201cfirm,\u201d as the family calls itself. Her situation in 2017 isn\u2019t at all scandalous, unlike that of King Edward VIII, who was forced to abdicate the throne in 1936 in order to marry the twice-divorced American socialite Wallis Simpson.\n\nHowever, Markle\u2019s situation with Harry could be seen as controversial. What is also certainly groundbreaking about the upcoming marriage is that Markle is a woman of color. Her father is white, and her mother is black.\n\nThe idea of a member of the British royal family marrying someone who is biracial set off a range of responses on social media. Not surprisingly, the internet racists had lots of offensive things to say, according to Rawstory.\n\nBut mostly there was celebration, according to Refinery29. The celebration came from people who said, among other things, that it was time for someone to shake up Britain\u2019s class system, which has long been accused of elitist and racist ways.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/eveewing/status/935155617051955201\n\nWE GOT ONE IN THE PALACE, Y\u2019ALL! pic.twitter.com/ijYqJZqmIq \u2014 lauren warren (@iamlaurenp) November 27, 2017\n\nActually, Markle\u2019s biracial identity hasn\u2019t been a subject the media has talked about much over the past few months. Part of the reason for the lack of discussion could stem from the unfortunate way the British press addressed her background soon after it became known that she was dating Harry, the Huffington Post said.\n\nA Daily Mail columnist speculated on the \u201cexotic DNA\u201d Markle would bring to the royal family tree and described her mother as \u201ca dreadlocked African-American lady from the wrong side of the tracks.\u201d\n\nOther tabloids used terms like \u201cgangsta\u201d and referred to the \u201ccrime-plagued\u201d Los Angeles neighborhood Markle grew up in.\n\nActually, Markle is a \u201cvalley girl,\u201d who grew up in a comfortable leafy suburb of Los Angeles\u2019 San Fernando Valley. She\u2019s also a graduate of Northwestern University, one of America\u2019s top colleges.\n\nIt could be that the media heeded Harry\u2019s rare public condemnation of the tabloids writing pieces with \u201cracial undertones\u201d about his girlfriend, or of reporters harassing her and her family.\n\nThen again, Markle herself may have diffused tensions by writing openly herself about the challenges of being biracial.\n\nIn December 2016, she penned a poignant essay for Elle UK. In the essay, she said she\u2019s been asked to explain her racial heritage nearly every day of her life, from the time she was a little girl to when she was auditioning for roles in movies and on TV in the \u201clabel-driven\u201d entertainment industry.\n\nMarkle said her parents met in the 1970s. Her father worked as a lighting designer for a TV soap opera, and her mother eventually became a yoga teacher.\n\nWhile the neighborhood they raised her in was comfortable, it wasn\u2019t diverse, she said. So her family stood out: \u201cAnd there was my mom, caramel in complexion with her light-skinned baby in tow, being asked where my mother was since they assumed she was the nanny.\u201d\n\nOne of the challenges of being biracial is that society wants to categorize people as one thing or the other \u2014 either white or black, she said.\n\nShe felt this push most acutely in seventh grade when she was asked to fill out a census document that asked her to indicate her ethnicity. But her only choices were white, black, Hispanic or Asian.\n\n\u201cYou could only choose one, but that would be to choose one parent over the other \u2013 and one half of myself over the other,\u201d she wrote.\n\nWhen she told her father that night about her dilemma, he calmly, but with visible anger, told her, \u201cIf that happens again, you draw your own box.\u201d\n\nMarkle added that she has been with her mother when she was called the N-word, notably when she was home on break from college. As they were a driving away from a concert, another motorist yelled the slur at her mother.\n\n\u201cMy skin rushed with heat as I looked to my mom,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHer eyes welling with hateful tears, I could only breathe out a whisper of words, so hushed they were barely audible: \u2018It\u2019s OK, Mommy.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMarkle said she found that being \u201cethnically ambiguous\u201d brought disadvantages when she was auditioning for parts in TV and in films. She often found she wasn\u2019t \u201cenough\u201d for certain roles: \u201cI wasn\u2019t black enough for the black roles and I wasn\u2019t white enough for the white ones.\u201d\n\nSo she was grateful for the role of Rachel Zane in the TV legal drama \u201cSuits\u201d because the producers were looking for an actress who could pull off being a beautiful woman with a fine legal mind \u2014 regardless of race.\n\n\u201cIn making a choice like that, the \u2018Suits\u2019 producers helped shift the way pop culture defines beauty,\u201d she said.\n\nMarkle said she was even more delighted in Season 2 when the producers cast Wendell Pierce, a dark-skinned African-American actor, to play the part of Rachel\u2019s father. Pierce, by the way, issued congratulations to Markle on news of her engagement:\n\nCongratulations to my TV daughter Meghan Markle and Prince Harry on the news of their wedding engagement. Harry you have her TV Father\u2019s blessing. Robert Zane approves @Suits_USA \u2014 Wendell Pierce (@WendellPierce) November 27, 2017\n\nNearly a year before she became engaged to the fifth in line to the British throne, Markle said in her essay that she would continue to live by her father\u2019s words: She would draw her own box and voice her pride in being a mixed-race woman.\n\n\u201cWhile my mixed heritage may have created a gray area surrounding my self-identification, keeping me with a foot on both sides of the fence, I have come to embrace that,\u201d she wrote."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Bode Miller, in full Samuel Bode Miller, (born October 12, 1977, Easton, New Hampshire, U.S.), American Alpine skier who won six Olympic medals\u2014more than any other male American skier\u2014and won the men\u2019s World Cup overall championship in 2005 and 2008.\n\nMiller was born in the heart of the White Mountains. His parents were self-styled hippies who lived deep in the woods in a house with no electricity or running water, and Miller was homeschooled until the fourth grade. After his parents divorced, his mother took him to nearby Cannon Mountain while she worked, often leaving him in the care of the ski school staff. At age 11 he began skiing competitively.\n\nA natural athlete, Miller earned all-state honours in high school in both soccer and tennis and was an avid golfer. He was a promising snowboarder as well, but ultimately he decided to focus on skiing. He first made the U.S. ski team in 1998 and competed that year in the Nagano (Japan) Winter Olympics; he failed to win a medal. At the 2001 F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Ski (FIS) World Ski Championships in St. Anton, Austria, he tore ligaments in his left knee in a racing crash, but he rebounded to collect silver medals in the giant slalom (GS) and the combined event at the 2002 Olympic Winter Games in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nMiller went on to post increasingly better results. In 2003 he became the first American to win two gold medals at a single World Championships, capturing the GS and combined titles. He also won three U.S. national titles that year. In 2004 he recorded six World Cup wins en route to taking the GS World Cup title\u2014the first in any discipline by an American man since Phil Mahre won the overall and GS titles in 1983. Miller\u2019s phenomenal performances continued into 2005, when he became the only skier in the 39-year history of the World Cup tour to win the first three races of a season. He also picked up two gold medals\u2014in downhill and supergiant slalom (super-G)\u2014at the World Championships. In 2005 Miller also claimed the World Cup overall championship. In doing so, he became only the second man in history to win in all four disciplines\u2014slalom, GS, super-G, and downhill\u2014during a single season. He was also the first American skier to capture a World Cup overall title since 1983.\n\nAt the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy, Miller competed in five events but failed to win a medal. The following year he won the super-G World Cup title. Shortly thereafter Miller, known for his independence and outspokenness, announced that he was leaving the U.S. ski team. In 2008 he won his 28th World Cup victory to break the U.S. record set by Mahre. (Miller\u2019s record of 32 titles was in turn broken by Lindsey Vonn in 2010.) Later that year he captured his second World Cup overall title. He struggled in the 2009 season, however, as he failed to win a race. In late 2009 Miller rejoined the U.S. ski team, and the following year at the Vancouver Winter Olympics he won his first Olympic gold, taking the top spot in the super combined, as well as a silver medal in the super-G and a bronze in the downhill.\n\nIn 2011 he won his 33rd career World Cup race, a downhill event. Miller skipped the 2013 World Cup season to recover from knee surgery. At the 2014 Olympic Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, he won a bronze medal in the super-G to become the most-decorated American Olympic skier of all time. In addition, he became, at age 36, the oldest individual to win an Olympic medal in an Alpine skiing event. Miller missed the beginning of the 2014\u201315 skiing season while recovering from back surgery. During his first race of the season\u2014a super-G event at the World Championships in February 2015\u2014he crashed and severed a tendon in his right leg, forcing him to miss the remainder of the World Championships. After not being able to return to the racing circuit for two years, Miller officially retired from competitive skiing in 2017 and then joined the National Broadcasting Company as an analyst for the company\u2019s Olympic skiing broadcasts.\n\nMiller\u2019s autobiography, Bode: Go Fast, Be Good, Have Fun (written with Jack McEnany), was published in 2005."}

And when I tell people that, they\u2019re like, \u2018You\u2019re 23, why do you need to do that? Why do you need to freeze your eggs?\u2019 Doing an ovarian reserve is important to me because I\u2019m fortunate enough to have that as an option, but I need to be aggressive about protecting my fertility, about protecting myself,\u201d Halsey \u2014 whose real name is Ashley Nicolette Frangipane \u2014 said on Thursday\u2019s episode of The Doctors.\n\nHalsey Dimitrios Kambouris/amfAR/Getty Images\n\nHalsey spoke openly about her endometriosis for the first time in January 2017, detailing the \u201cfrustrating\u201d process of getting diagnosed.\n\n\u201cThe thing with endometriosis is that it comes down to that doctors can tend to minimize the female experience when it comes to dealing with it,\u201d she said. \u201cMy whole life, my mother had always told me, \u2018Women in our family just have really bad periods.\u2019 It was just something she thought she was cursed to deal with and I was cursed to deal with, and that was just a part of my life.\u201d\n\nBut as Halsey toured the world to perform, the stress from being on stage \u2014 along with her undiagnosed physical health issues \u2014 became too much to bear. One day she collapsed outside her tour bus.\n\n\u201cMy tour manager had to take me to a hospital. And the whole time I was there no one knew what to tell me,\u201d she recalled. \u201cDehydration, stress, anxiety and I was saying, \u2018What about my pain?\u2019 A lot of the time they can make you think it\u2019s in your head.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until she met Dr. Thais Aliabadi that she finally learned she had endometriosis.\n\n\u201cIt was so bittersweet, because it was the relief of knowing that I wasn\u2019t making it up, and I wasn\u2019t being sensitive, and it wasn\u2019t all in my head, but it also kind of sucked to know that I was going to be living with this forever,\u201d Halsey said.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Halsey Opens Up About Her Endometriosis Battle\n\nAnd just a few months after her diagnosis, she underwent a traumatic experience.\n\n\u201cI was on tour, and I found out I was pregnant. And before I could really figure out what that meant to me and what that meant for my future, for my career, for my life, for my relationship, the next thing I knew I was on stage miscarrying in the middle of my concert,\u201d Halsey revealed. \u201cAnd the sensation of looking a couple hundred teenagers in the face while you\u2019re bleeding through your clothes and still having to do the show, and realizing in that moment that I never want to make that choice ever again of doing what I love or not being able to because of this disease.\u201d\n\nThe experience pushed her to find a way to manage the chronic disorder, and with the help of Dr. Aliabadi, she got an IUD and underwent surgery.\n\nA year later, Halsey said she \u201cfeels much better\u201d now and is confident in her decision to freeze her eggs and take control of her fertility.\n\n\u201cReproductive illness is so frustrating because it can really make you feel like less of a woman,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of times when you\u2019re sitting at home and you just feel so terrible about yourself. You\u2019re sick, you don\u2019t feel sexy, you don\u2019t feel proud, you don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s much hope. And so taking these measures, so that hopefully I can have a bright future and achieve the things that I want to achieve by doing the ovarian reserve is really important.\u201d\n\nThe Doctors airs weekdays.

But the brand is called Skinnygirl Jeans, so you may be wondering, \"are they definitely for me?\" Here are the details on the sizes included in Bethenny Frankel's new jeans line so you know if you can grab a few for yourself come September.\n\nAccording to Bethenny, it is her mission to design jeans for all shapes and sizes and the jeans will be available in sizes 24-32 and plus sizes 14W-24W. The jeans have great attention to detail and include black and denim fabric decorated with smoked stones, tuxedo detail, silver chains, and crystals. They'll be designs that are mid-rise and high-rise and as Bethanny said in her Instagram story, they are for all \"ages, shapes, sizes, and races. \"It's all inclusive and plus sizes are on the same rack as a size 0,\" she said in a recent story. Just as she rolled out her Skinnygirl margaritas before developing her vodkas and wines, she hopes that these items are the start of a much larger clothing line.\n\nWith hashtags like #allshapesallsizes and the constant claim that Bethenny wants the women who wear her jeans to feel empowered, it may feel odd that despite coming in sizes up to 32 and including the plus sizes, the line is called \"Skinnygirl.\" The New York Post captured this concern in an article titled, Bethenny Frankel's new Skinnygirl jeans line is incredibly tone-deaf. The article states, \"women today are tired of being told they need to be a size 2 in order to be desirable, happy and fulfilled.\" They mention Ashley Graham and Iskra Lawrence, who have both used their social media platforms to celebrate their curvier figures.\n\nThough she is likely using the name Skinnygirl to capitalize on her other brands (and she is nothing if not brilliant at marketing), there's a risk with the use of the word \"skinny\". Body positivity, being happy with the body you have and not obsessed with the body you want, is on the rise and there could be backlash against a brand of clothing that has the word \"skinny\" in it's name, no matter what sizes it includes. As Chastity Garner, co-founder of theCURVYcon, told Yahoo news, \u201cTo me, [Skinnygirl] is a name that means you are trying to look, feel, or achieve being skinny,\u201d she says. \u201cAmerica doesn\u2019t have a good relationship with the word \u2018skinny,\u2019 so I think it can be hazardous to women, but especially young girls.\u201d\n\nIs Skinnygirl something to aspire to or does it imply that everyone has an inner skinny girl, not matter what your actual size? \u201cSkinnygirl is a state of mind; it\u2019s about applauding your strength and feeling good about yourself. It is important to me that this line is inclusive of all shapes and sizes, offering women premium denim fits in the most innovative and comfortable fabrics, at a sensible value,\u201d Frankel said in a statement that was reported in Rivet. This may sound good to Frankel, but moms who are careful about the words they use in support of body positivity may steer clear of a brand with \"skinny\" in its name.\n\nWhile the concept of a jean line that is for all shapes, sizes, and ages with a reasonable price point (all items will around $100 or less), great materials, and fun details is exciting, it'll be interesting to see if the aspirational marketing helps the larger sizes sell or if it's only truly skinny girls who will buy into the Skinnygirl concept."}

{"label": true, "txt": "\"It\u2019s not a nice thing to tell someone they should be ashamed of themselves,\" Cyrus told Jimmy Kimmel about being pressured to apologize for exposing the skin of her back at age 15.\n\nMiley Cyrus doesn\u2019t worry about yesterday. She doesn\u2019t even care about tomorrow. And she certainly isn't losing any sleep over a scantily clad photo of herself published 10 years ago.\n\nEarlier this week, the pop singer retracted her apology for a controversial photo published in Vanity Fair back in 2008. Her curt Twitter retort still stands: \"IM NOT SORRY. Fuck YOU.\" But there\u2019s more.\n\nIn a Tuesday night interview on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Cyrus took a swipe at the New York Post, the POTUS, and everyone who points the finger of shame. \"I never really keep track of the years that have gone by since something like this,\" she said, with a nod to a printout of the resurfaced Post headline about the photo shoot.\n\n\"A lot of things have changed and I think the conversation has changed a lot.... Sure, some people thought I did something wrong in their eyes.

{"label": true, "txt": "If you\u2019re looking for some hints as to what tomorrow\u2019s \u201cGirls\u201d finale has in store, Allison Williams is not the person to ask. In an interview with TheWrap, the actress known to \u201cGirls\u201d fans everywhere as Marnie Michaels is going to watch it for the first time on Sunday night with show creator and co-star Lena Dunham.\n\n\u201cI could have seen it,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThey sent it to me, but I just decided I wanted to see it in real time.\u201d\n\nWhat we do know is that the final episode of \u201cGirls\u201d won\u2019t see Hannah, Shoshanna, Marnie and Jessa giving viewers catharsis by seeing them all together as the screen fades to black. Last week\u2019s episode saw the four come to an uneasy reconciliation with each other in the bathroom of Shosh\u2019s apartment, but with all of them coming to accept that they are all better off without each other. Before the four go their separate ways tomorrow night, Williams told us about how the series has changed her as an actress and how she thinks Marnie has changed as a person.\n\nAlso Read: 'Girls': 10 Times Hannah Showed Up Wearing the Wrong Thing (Photos)\n\nHow did you feel about the decision to have the girls go their separate ways and not see each other in the finale?\n\nI didn\u2019t really know what to make of it from a creator\u2019s point of view because I always try to keep my nose out of what they are doing and I just trust what they\u2019re doing. But from a selfish point of view, I was sad we weren\u2019t all going to be in the same place when the show wrapped because it\u2019s such an emotional moment and it felt strange to know that we were saying goodbye to people who are very close to us before we said goodbye to the show en masse. But I guess it made it more emotionally manageable because the fact that everyone wasn\u2019t done at the same moment meant that everything was more slow and gradual and less of a shock when it was finally over.\n\nMarnie seems to have moments of self-reflection and then backtrack, do you think the scene in the pawn shop this season had a lasting effect in changing how she sees herself?\n\nI love that scene for a million reasons, but especially because Marnie\u2019s ability to view herself has always been hindered by her own point of view on the person she\u2019s talking to. It\u2019s hard for her to take constructive criticism from Hannah, Jessa and Shosh because they\u2019re all peers, so the idea of taking a big lesson from them always felt silly for Marnie. But whenever she faces these cold truths, it comes from unexpected sources.\n\nIn this case, she thinks she\u2019s wearing something she thought this man in a pawn shop had never seen before. She\u2019s like \u2018I\u2019m not your average pawn shopper, this is an anomalous situation for me.\u2019 And he tells her, \u2018Hey, nobody comes in here when everything\u2019s great. You aren\u2019t an exception to every rule.\u2019 And whenever somebody says that to Marnie, it\u2019s very tough for her to hear, but it\u2019s important. It\u2019s also easier to hear when it\u2019s not coming from someone you watched throw up at a college party. But the phone call she makes to Desi afterwards shows that the talk had an impact on her that other talks don\u2019t always land. Because it came from this stranger and because it came at a very vulnerable moment for her, it does end up altering things for her. It sets the stage for someone who is starting to learn how to operate in the world given how she is.\n\nAlso Read: 'Black Panther' Cast Does #GetOutChallenge, Scare the Crap Out of Daniel Kaluuya (Video)\n\nThis is a show where the characters hurt each other a lot. Who\u2019s the one person Marnie owes an apology to and who really owes Marnie an apology?\n\nWell\u2026I sort of think they all owe each other apologies. I think she and everyone she\u2019s ever dated need to apologize to each other. I don\u2019t really know who is at fault, but I do know there\u2019s a lot of hurt there. When those relationships are taking form, there\u2019s a lot of growing pains and people thrash around and accidentally hurt each other a lot.\n\nMarnie\u2019s no exception to that. Charlie really hurt her. Desi really hurt her by destroying what she thought she wanted and was always going to have and really sending her out into the world in confusion and disarray. But I also don\u2019t know if it should be a full-throated apology because people who have sent her adrift have also triggered some kind of real growth and introspection on her part. I think that tallying of hurt and who is at fault is something that done so much more at the beginning of the show, and at a certain point, there comes a time when they all just call it even.\n\nThat\u2019s true especially in this group of friends. If they were to go back and tally how many times they\u2019ve been hurt or they\u2019ve hurt people and start making amends, I think it would quickly become a pretzel and everyone out of exhaustion would agree to make a blanket apology and move on.\n\nWay back in the first season, \u201cGirls\u201d was criticized in some corners for not being diverse enough. Did your time on \u201cGirls\u201d increase your interest in telling stories about social issues or in taking roles in projects like \u201cGet Out\u201d?\n\nI don\u2019t think \u201cGirls\u201d and \u201cGet Out\u201d had anything directly to do with each other. I would have played Rose at any time in my career. It was the sort of role I have always kept an eye out for creatively. I do think \u201cGirls\u201d gave me a sort of critical eye towards the projects that I take on because I knew what it looked like to be a part of something that was created carefully. I wanted to be a part of projects that made deliberate choices and took risks. Safety wasn\u2019t something I was interested in anymore and that negated a lot of the roles that were coming my way.\n\nBut as for the criticism of the show, I think being on \u201cGirls\u201d has taught me to look for roles that were written from a position of intimate knowledge of what they were writing about rather than about a life they didn\u2019t know, which is why Lena didn\u2019t want to try and screw up writing somebody else\u2019s intimate truth. Because of the nature and tone of \u201cGirls,\u201d that would be a big whiff. So now I know to look for shows that take that same approach.\n\nAlso Read: How Dave Porter Merges the Music of 'Better Call Saul' and 'Breaking Bad' (Audio)\n\nI also think \u201cGirls\u201d taught me to have the confidence to be patient and wait for the right thing to come along so that when I got the script for \u201cGet Out\u201d and then talked to Jordan [Peele], I knew what I had in front of me and I knew that it was worth any risk involved. \u201cGirls\u201d has given me so many things, but the biggest has been that quiet confidence to make decisions in an industry that pushes you to make quick decisions because of the artificial urgency about people making up their minds.\n\nIf, ten years from now, there was a reunion movie or miniseries for \u201cGirls,\u201d would you be down for it? And what do you think Marnie\u2019s life would look like a decade from now?\n\nOh, of course I would be down for a reunion. I already miss working with these people so I would love to reunite. As for Marnie, I think the only way she can have lasting happiness is if she ends up in a relationship with Elijah or somebody like Elijah, where it\u2019s a very modern romance situation where they both get to do what they want to do outside the marriage. But they have a total support system for each other and get to live life with a partner without having to deal with the messiness of intimacy and love that I think is an Achilles\u2019 heel for both Marnie and Elijah. But we\u2019ll see. If a reunion happens I\u2019m sure that \u2014 as has always been the case \u2014 Lena and Jenni [Konner] and Judd [Apatow] will come up with something that is both completely unexpected and something that I never could have thought of.\n\nThe series finale of \u201cGirls\u201d airs Sunday, April 16 at 10 p.m. on HBO.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity."}

{"label": true, "txt": "These stories are true. At the time, I said to myself that what I did was O.K. because I never showed a woman my dick without asking first, which is also true. But what I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your dick isn\u2019t a question. It\u2019s a predicament for them. The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly. I have been remorseful of my actions. And I\u2019ve tried to learn from them. And run from them. Now I\u2019m aware of the extent of the impact of my actions. I learned yesterday the extent to which I left these women who admired me feeling badly about themselves and cautious around other men who would never have put them in that position. I also took advantage of the fact that I was widely admired in my and their community, which disabled them from sharing their story and brought hardship to them when they tried because people who look up to me didn\u2019t want to hear it. I didn\u2019t think that I was doing any of that because my position allowed me not to think about it. There is nothing about this that I forgive myself for. And I have to reconcile it with who I am. Which is nothing compared to the task I left them with. I wish I had reacted to their admiration of me by being a good example to them as a man and given them some guidance as a comedian, including because I admired their work.\n\nThe hardest regret to live with is what you\u2019ve done to hurt someone else. And I can hardly wrap my head around the scope of hurt I brought on them. I\u2019d be remiss to exclude the hurt that I\u2019ve brought on people who I work with and have worked with who\u2019s professional and personal lives have been impacted by all of this, including projects currently in production: the cast and crew of Better Things, Baskets, The Cops, One Mississippi, and I Love You, Daddy. I deeply regret that this has brought negative attention to my manager Dave Becky who only tried to mediate a situation that I caused. I\u2019ve brought anguish and hardship to the people at FX who have given me so much The Orchard who took a chance on my movie. and every other entity that has bet on me through the years.

{"label": true, "txt": "The shows in the Battle of the Network Fairy Tale Shows have a lot in common. Both make cute, modern-day references to the fairy tales that inspired them; both have talented casts; and both seem to like putting their orphaned protagonists in red leather jackets. They also seem to be each other\u2019s exact opposite. Whereas Once Upon a Time is a female-led show, Grimm has a predominantly male energy. Once is light and romantic, Grimm is gritty and grounded. And while the protagonist of Once is a loner who doesn\u2019t easily trust or let people in, the protagonist of Grimm is a romantic with family ties, friends, and a girlfriend.\n\nHow did these shows stack up after both pilots aired and the smoke cleared? Find out below!\n\nA reminder: Each episode will be graded in each category from 0-2, and then each category will be added up for the show\u2019s grand total for the week. Weekly totals will be added throughout the season, and the show with the highest score at the end of the season will be declared Television\u2019s Best Fairy Tale Show.\n\nOnce Upon a Time, Ep 1: \u201cPilot\u201d\n\nSnow White\u2019s (Ginnifer Goodwin) wicked stepmother (Lana Parrilla) can\u2019t bear Snow\u2019s happily ever after, so she puts a curse not only on Snow White and Prince Charming (Josh Dallas), but on all of the fairy tale characters as punishment. They\u2019re banished to the modern-day town of Storybrooke, Maine; a place where time never passes, and none of its fairy tale inhabitants remember who they are. Emma Swan, a bail bonds agent (person?), holds the key to breaking the spell, but she doesn\u2019t know it until Henry, the son she gave up for adoption years ago (Jared Gilmore), comes back into her life with a book of fairy tales and insists she come with him to Storybrooke. Skeptical at first, Emma agrees to stay in Storybrooke for a week when she notices certain things that lead her to believe that what the boy told her might not be just the product of an overactive imagination.\n\nScript (1): This is what gave me the most trouble. While both the premise of the show and the story of this episode are enjoyable, the execution of Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis\u2019 script could\u2019ve been better. Whereas the flashback device worked well on Lost to illuminate character, here it only serves to let the air out of any suspense that could be generated. The episode starts out with title cards that explain exactly what we\u2019re going to be watching, and proceeds to give us back story before getting to the main character, whom we then have to watch discover it all over again. Other than the revelation of Henry\u2019s relationship to Emma, there\u2019s little to keep us guessing.\n\nThere\u2019s also the issue of dialogue. If the choice is to have a \u201cfairy tale half\u201d and a \u201cmodern world half,\u201d then the two have to be distinct. You can feel the writers trying to do that by having the fairy tale characters sound more proper and \u201cOld World\u201d in their speech than the modern characters, but they struggle to maintain it, and the fairy tale characters slip into lines like \u201ctake the queen out\u201d and \u201cthere is, indeed, a catch,\u201d which pull the viewer out of the world. It would be one thing if the entire show were set in this fairy tale world and the modern speech patterns were a choice, but in this pilot, the speech just feels sloppy.\n\nLastly, if time never passes in Storybrooke, how is there day and night? And why do they know what Emma means when she says she\u2019s going to rent a room for \u201ca week?\u201d (Perhaps I\u2019ve been watching too much Doctor Who.)\n\nPerformances (2): The cast is solid all around, but special kudos need to go to Jennifer Morrison, whose Emma Swan is a perfect blend of hard and vulnerable, and Robert Carlyle as an appropriately smarmy and deranged Rumplestiltskin/Mr. Gold.\n\nProduction (2): The show is certainly beautiful. From the elaborate costumes and sets of the fairy tale world, to the Stepford-esque design of Storybrooke, to the spare, yet colorful look of Emma\u2019s real-world life, the look of the show is appropriate for each of the worlds that make it up. The visual effects are mostly reserved for the fairy tale world, and even things like Prince Charming\u2019s injury look a bit \u201cfake,\u201d as if being depicted in a children\u2019s book.\n\nRepresentation (1.5): One of the most wonderful things about the show is the fact that the female characters are so prominent, powerful, and nuanced. Snow White takes the lead in her relationship with Prince Charming, but not in a harsh, \u201cman-hating\u201d way. She makes most of the major decisions, and he trusts her. His desire to protect her are depicted as no different than her desire to protect him and their child. Emma Swan starts out as a bit of an action hero \u0097 slamming a guy\u2019s head into a steering wheel! \u0097 but has a complex history even before we get to the fairy tale stuff. She\u2019s a birth mother to an adopted child, something that is rarely explored on television. Of the five lead characters, three are women!\n\nWhere the show could do better, at least as of this first episode, is with racial minorities. The main cast is entirely white (though Lana Parrilla is half Puerto Rican-half Italian). The only speaking roles for black actors were the bishop performing Snow White\u2019s wedding and Rumplestiltskin\u2019s jailer. There were some scattered multiracial faces in crowd scenes (and one of the Seven Dwarves was Asian), but otherwise this was a lily-white production.\n\nAudience Engagement (1.5): This show will definitely appeal to viewers who love fairy tales and magic, and it\u2019s a show that families can watch together, which earns it some mainstream cred. However, it might be a little too cute for some people. On the social media front, there\u2019s not much activity on the Once Upon a Time Twitter or Facebook page, and what activity there is isn\u2019t particularly interesting. ABC doesn\u2019t seem to be actively courting an audience, merely expecting them to tune in and watch.\n\nTOTAL SCORE FOR ONCE UPON A TIME: 8 (out of 10)\n\nGrimm, Ep. 1: \u201cPilot\u201d\n\nDetective Nick Burckhardt (David Giuntoli), has been noticing strange things. When the aunt who raised him (Kate Burton) falls ill, she comes to him to explain them, telling him that fairy tales aren\u2019t stories, they\u2019re warnings, and that he is descended from a long line of grimms, people with the unique ability to see the true natures of the fairy tale beings that live among us in the real world. As he and his partner, Hank Griffin (Russell Hornsby) solve the case of a missing little girl, Nick begins to used his newly-discovered ability in his work. Meanwhile, danger seems to be closing in on him and his girlfriend, Juliette (Bitsie Tulloch), from all directions \u0097 including that of his boss, Captain Renard (Sasha Roiz).\n\nScript (1.5): David Greenwalt and Jim Kouf\u2019s pilot had a tight, well-paced, suspenseful script that managed to frighten even as it maintained a sense of humor and warmth. While it was clear that the episode was using the story of Little Red Riding Hood as a template, it wasn\u2019t an exact retelling of the story. It successfully used that story as a metaphor for a crime being committed in the real world, which is what the original Grimm stories were in the first place \u0097 metaphors for real dangers. The script also does a great job of fleshing out the main character with minimal exposition.\n\nBut it, like most pilot scripts, wasn\u2019t perfect. Having the entire resolution of the case hinge on a song heard on an iPod was farfetched (and I\u2019m saying this regarding a show that deals in fairy tales!). From the iPod still playing The Eurhythmics\u2019 \u201cSweet Dreams\u201d hours after the person listening to it has been torn to shreds, to the attacker humming the song when the police stop by to investigate (did he listen to his victim\u2019s iPod, or notice the song that was playing as he was attacking her?), to Hank remembering the song and using that as his Probable Cause to go back into a suspect\u2019s home all stretches credibility.\n\nPerformances (2): Again, we have a very solid cast. Giuntoli seems like an actual person in this role, rather than a Television Hero, and he and Hornsby have wonderful on-screen chemistry. I was intrigued by Reggie Lee as Sgt. Wu, who managed to inject the few lines he had in the episode with so much personality that it made me curious about his character. And Silas Weir Mitchell is a standout, providing wonderful comedy relief as Eddie Monroe, reformed blutbad.\n\nProduction (1.5): Portland provides a lush, green backdrop for Grimm, and cinematographer, Clark Mathis, highlights this to its fullest effect. That, coupled with the soft design of the homes and many of the costumes allow the show to echo fairy tales while remaining firmly rooted in the real world. Likewise the visual effects when Nick sees a fairy tale creature\u2019s true nature. The transformations between beast and human always look plausible.\n\nRepresentation (1.5): Grimm scores points in that, of its six lead actors, two are played by minority actors \u0097 Russell Hornsby and Reggie Lee. However, they, as well as the doctor treating Nick\u2019s aunt, are the only minority faces we see the entire episode. The pilot doesn\u2019t do terribly well by its female characters, either. So far, Juliette\u2019s main purpose seems to be to look pretty, comfort Nick when he\u2019s troubled, and to provide a focal point for his angst over his new ability. She exists only as a device in relation to his character. I hope that changes. Likewise, the hexenbeist (played by Claire Coffee) seems to exist simply to serve Captain Renard, though her connection to him is merely touched upon at the end of the episode, and we don\u2019t see them interact much.\n\nWhat saves the show on that front, for me, is Nick\u2019s Aunt Marie. Not only do we have an older woman who is clearly willing to fight dangerous creatures with elaborate weaponry, but she\u2019s also a nice change from the standard Older White Man Leading Young Female to Empowerment. It\u2019s nice that finally, after student-teacher relationships like Buffy/Giles (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), The Bride/Bill (Kill Bill), and Sweet Pea/Wise Man (Sucker Punch), we have an older woman leading a young man to empowerment. Because, you know, sometimes men can learn things from women. I know, right?\n\nAudience Engagement (2): Everyone is into procedurals in one way or another. The fact that Grimm is a police procedural that looks at fairy tales sideways means that it will not only entertain fantasy/fairy tale fans, but also people looking for a procedural other than CSI or SVU to watch. It also allows for more standalone stories, which means that viewers can easily jump on anywhere. As for more direct audience interaction, NBC is on it. The cast of Grimm, as well as NBC, are all extremely active on Twitter and Facebook, and actually talk to fans rather than simply send them links related to the show. They also allowed Twitter followers the chance to see the pilot early, as well as had a contest for a Grimm \u201cLittle Red Riding Hoodie\u201d during the premiere.\n\nTOTAL SCORE FOR GRIMM: 8.5 (out of 10)\n\nWEEK 1 WINNER: Grimm\n\nWhew! That was a close race! What do you think? Let me know below!\n\nOnce Upon a Time airs Sundays at 8/7 Central on ABC. Grimm airs Fridays at 9/8 Central on NBC.\n\nTeresa Jusino thinks Juliette Silverton deserves better.

For this roundup, we\u2019re looking at important moments within the \u201cStranger Things\u201d universe itself, and leaving all the references to 80s movies and pop culture for another time.\n\nKeep scrolling for a look at 11 details you might have overlooked on the second season of \u201cStranger Things.\u201d\n\nLucas teased Dustin about not getting the princess when he played 'Dragon's Lair,' foreshadowing how Lucas would wind up with Max by the end of the season. Netflix Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) and Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) in the arcade. 'You're just not nimble enough,' Lucas said. 'You'll get there one day, but until then Princess Daphne is still mine.' The rest of the season played out a small love triangle between Dustin, Lucas, and Max, but Dustin was left alone and without a love interest by the end of the season. He'll get there one day, right? It was ironic to hear Murray Bauman say he thought Eleven was a Russian child, since Eleven was being used by Hawkins Lab to spy on Russians. Netflix Actor Brett Gelman played the conspiracy theorist. On the opening episode of the second season, Bauman harasses Chief Jim Hopper about his theory involving a Russian child (Eleven) and an elaborate conspiracy with international consequences. Bauman had pieces of the story correct, but the things he got wrong were telling. The Russians are mentioned by various characters, but often as a vague allusion to the Cold War, but no one knows how they connect to Hawkins Lab. Netflix Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) listening to a Russian man speak on season one. No one seems to realise Dr. Brenner and Hawkins lab seemed to first plan on using Eleven to spy on Russians by showing her their picture and having her listen to them with her powers. Eleven herself is likely unaware of what her temporary involvement in the Cold War was, given how limited her understanding of the world is. Mike paused when he picked up his dinosaur toy because it reminded him of Eleven's first time in his bedroom. Netflix Mike (Finn Wolfhard) and the T-rex on season two, episode one, 'Madmax.' After Mike continues acting out, his parents make him sell his old toys as punishment. He tells his mum they have 'emotional value,' but gets dismissed. Mike wasn't joking -- some of the toys in his basement are direct connections he still has with Eleven. 'This is my dinosaur, Roary, he has a speaker in his mouth so he can roar,' Mike told Eleven back on season one. Netflix Eleven was unimpressed by Roary. In that same season one scene, Mike told Eleven about Yoda and how he could move things with his mind. Later Dustin tried to get Eleven to make Mike's toy Millennium Falcon move. Will's 'Ghostbusters' costume was slightly different from the others, subtly signalling that he's not as well off as his friends. Netflix The boys on episode two, 'Trick or Treat, Freak.' On the first episode of season two, Joyce was sewing the 'Ghostbusters' patch onto Will's Halloween costume. When we saw them altogether, it was clear that Will's was a different colour and slight less 'realistic,' likely because Joyce had to make more of it by hand. You can already tell based on their houses and other mentions of family wealth that the Byers aren't on the same socioeconomic plane as Dustin, Lucas, and Mike's families. But this was a subtle way of showing how it affects Will's day-to-day life with his friends. When Eleven broke back through the Upside Down, she entered through the same Wall the Demogorgon used on season one. Netflix Eleven was trapped in the Upside Down temporarily after killing the Demogorgon. After season one, a popular fan theory posited that Eleven and Demogorgon were the same being, almost as if the Demogorgon was Eleven's alter-ego. By mirroring the way the Demogorgon broke into Hawkins Middle School with Eleven's return, the Duffer Brothers might have been nodding to this theory. Netflix The Demogorgon on the season one finale. By the end of season two, it's made clear that Eleven is definitely not a Demogorgon but instead is the only human (we know of) capable of keeping the evil Shadow Monster/Mind Flayer at bay. Once again, though, a connection was drawn between Eleven and the new monster haunting Hawkins. Netflix The Mind Flayer, also called the Shadow Monster by the kids. On the first episode of season two, 'Madmax,' Murray Bauman tells Hopper a story he heard about a girl with 'psionic abilities.' One of the other cops asks what that means, and Bauman says 'psychic.' Psionic is the same term used in 'Dungeons and Dragons,' and Dustin repeats it when describing the Mind Flayer. Netflix Dustin shows this page to the rest of the group on episode eight, 'Mind Flayer.' Though we don't believe this is meant to spark new theories about the Mind Flayer and Eleven being the same person or being. Instead it signifies the importance of Eleven's powers and how her presence in Hawkins is clearly triggering a crossover between other dimensions. Eleven opened the first gate into the Upside Down, and now the Mind Flayer knows she's capable of overcoming him (thanks to that epic finale showdown). Will they face off again on season three? Now onto some significant Hopper revelations. His secret knock for Eleven spells 'us' in Morse code. Netflix Hopper (David Harbour) hid Eleven in a remote cabin. Hopper's relationship with Eleven was a tumultuous reckoning for him, given how he lost his own daughter before she could grow up to be Eleven's age. Since Morse code featured so heavily on this season, several people on the 'Stranger Things' subreddit picked up on the knock he created for their signal having added meaning. Hopper would knock twice, pause and knock again, then do three quick knocks, which matches the Morse code for 'us' (\u2022\u2022 -- /\u2022\u2022\u2022). Hopper was reading a heartbreaking passage of 'Anne of Green Gables' to Eleven. Netflix Eleven had a flashback to this moment on episode three, 'The Pollywog.' Eleven remembered Hopper reading to her. And not only was it the same book he used to read to his daughter, 'Anne of Green Gables,' but the passage chosen for the scene was telling. It was a section of the book where Anne describes her state as a orphan to a friend. Here's the full section Hopper read. 'I would feel so sad if I was a disappointment to her -- because she didn't live very long after that, you see. She died of a fever when I was just three months old. I do wish she'd lived long enough for me to remember calling her mother. I think it would be so sweet to say 'mother,' don't you? And father died four days afterwards from fever too. That left me an orphan and folks were at their wits' end, so Mrs. Thomas said, what to do with me. You see, nobody wanted me even then. It seems to be my fate.' We saw Hopper reading 'Anne of Green Gables' to his daughter when she was in the hospital back on season one. Netflix Hopper and Sara in the finale of season one. Hopper was reading a different passage at the time, but the fact that he chose the same book to read to Eleven really hammers in how much of a surrogate she is for Sara. An even more dramatic connection between Sara and Eleven came on the season two finale when Hopper and Eleven entered the stairwell of Hawkins Lab. Netflix The staircase rail as seen on the season two finale. Hopper and Eleven entered Hawkins Lab to close the gate to the Upside Down, and found Dr. Owens bleeding in the stairwell. The scene triggered a reminder of a quick flashback Hopper had on season one when remembering his daughter's death. On the first season, Hopper was shown crying in the corner of the same stairwell we now know is inside Hawkins Lab. Netflix The handrails are an exact match. While Dr. Owens wasn't sitting in the precise same corner where we saw Hopper curled up, the handrails are a dead match. While it is possible the 'Stranger Things' crew just re-used a set for the flashback and for Hawkins, we believe this might be the first concrete hint that Hopper's past is darker than previously believed. For one, we know Hopper used to be a 'big city' cop and he appears to have a deeper background in government and secrecy. What if Sara's death wasn't an unexpected illness, but instead was connected somehow to Hawkins Lab or another arm of the government? Read our explainer for more on why this was already a running theory after season one. To end on the happiest note of all, the Snow Ball was this season's best callback. Netflix Mr. Clarke hanging up decorations for the Snow Ball. Ending the second season with the Snow Ball was the happiest moment they could have given Mike and Eleven. Right before Mike kissed Eleven for the first time, he invited her to the Snow Ball. Netflix Eleven was pleasantly surprised by the kiss. Mike was fumbling through trying to explain to Eleven how she could be a part of their family, but not like a sister. 'Maybe we can go to the Snow Ball together,' Mike told Eleven on the first season. 'It's this cheesy school dance where you go in the gym and dance to music and stuff. I've never been, but I know you're not supposed to go with your sister.' When she still didn't understand, Mike gave up explaining and just kissed Eleven. Hopper making sure Eleven got one 'normal' night at the Snow Ball was a perfect way to tie up the separation between Mike and Eleven. Netflix Everything came full circle in the sweetest way. Mike finally got to go to the Snow Ball with Eleven, even it was more than a year later. And now that Eleven is 'officially' Hopper's daughter, we hope they aren't separated again on future seasons.

{"label": true, "txt": "No.\n\noverall No. in\n\nseason Title CBS recap Rating/share\n\n(18-49) Original air date US viewers\n\n(millions) Weekly\n\nrank\n\nHost Jeff Probst explained the Ghost Island premise to the 20 new castaways upon their arrival, saying that they had a chance to reverse the curse of bad Survivor decisions if they were to visit Ghost Island. Jeff instructed each tribe to choose a leader: Malolo selected Brendan, while Chris volunteered for Naviti. Jeff also told the castaways they would only start with a machete, pot, a fishing kit, and a smaller supply of rice. Reward Challenge: A designated runner will have to race through a series of obstacles to dig up three sets of keys. Then, a designated puzzle solver will use the keys to unlock a slide puzzle. The first person to finish their puzzle wins a massive shelter building kit reward for their tribe. Additionally, the losing tribe will be forced to forfeit their fishing kit. However, if the tribe leader decides to forfeit the challenge during the puzzle solving portion, their tribe will get to keep the fishing kit, but the opposing tribe will get 20 eggs and flint in addition to the shelter building kit. For Malolo and Naviti, respectively, Michael and Sebastian were selected to run the course, while Laurel and Desiree were selected for the puzzle. Chris pulled the lever on Desiree, preserving Naviti\u2019s fishing kit, but giving the larger reward to Malolo. As the Malolo tribe set up their shelter and got to know each other, Jacob openly stated his intention to search for a hidden immunity idol, causing his tribemates to distrust him. He also poured some of the tribe\u2019s rice in his dirty sock to see if a clue was hidden in the jar, though there was not. Meanwhile at the Naviti camp, a power struggle started between Chris and Domenick, who questioned Chris\u2019s decision to forfeit the opening challenge. Immunity Challenge: Each tribe will have to race across a net bridge to where two bags are hanging. Working together, they will then need to untie the bags to obtain a pair of ropes. Using the ropes, the tribe will need to slide a sled full of big puzzle pieces through a course. At the end of the course, they will need to solve a cube puzzle to win immunity. Naviti won the challenge, and also received a flint reward, as Malolo already had flint after winning the first reward challenge. For winning the immunity challenge, Naviti had to send one person from Malolo to Ghost Island, where they would be immune from the vote; Naviti sent Jacob after he declared Malolo was the best tribe in Survivor history. On Ghost Island, Jacob had to break an urn to play a game for an advantage; if he lost, he would have to forfeit his vote at the next Tribal Council. He subsequently won a game of chance which gave him Sierra\u2019s legacy advantage from Game Changers. He had to will it to someone from Naviti, and he chose Morgan. He also made a fake idol. At Malolo, the tribe had to come up with a new plan, as Jacob was their intended target. Gonzalez rallied votes against Donathan for being the tribe\u2019s weakest link, but at Tribal Council, her paranoia got the better of her as she whispered to her tribemates, asking who they were targeting that night. Although everyone told her they were targeting Donathan, it was revealed that they had lied to her, and Gonzalez was unanimously blindsided, becoming the first person voted out. At Naviti, Domenick searched for a hidden immunity idol in the middle of the night, which he eventually found; it was revealed to be Andrea\u2019s idol from Caramoan. The next morning, he attempted to bury the hatchet with Chris, but the tension still lingered between the two. Domenick told Chris he found an idol moments after telling him the opposite, which caused Chris to distrust him. At Malolo, Jacob kept the legacy advantage information to himself and told his tribemates he found an idol on Ghost Island, but that he had left the paper behind, making Brendan suspicious. Reward/Immunity Challenge: Two pairs from each tribe will race through a series of obstacles in the water. They will then have to dive to release two sets of buoys. Another member will need to gather all of the marked buoys to the finish, where the last four members will need to get all eight in a basket to win immunity and a comfort reward of chairs, pillows, blankets, and a washboard. Naviti easily won after James could not even dive a foot in the water. Donathan panicked before eventually diving down and releasing the buoys for Malolo. Naviti sent Donathan to Ghost Island, and the urn he smashed was a dud. At Malolo, Stephanie considered working with Jacob to blindside Michael, but Jacob spilled the beans about the legacy advantage to Stephanie. At Tribal Council, Libby and Michael voted against James in case Jacob did indeed have a real idol, but ultimately, the tribe stuck to the original plan, sending Jacob out of the game.\n\n528 2 \" Only Time Will Tell\" Recap 1.7/7[6] March 7, 2018 ( ) 8.23[6] 14[7]\n\nThe morning after Jacob's elimination, Jeff announced a tribe swap. The new Malolo tribe consisted of Bradley, Brendan, Chelsea, Desiree, Jenna, Kellyn, Michael, Sebastian, and Stephanie. The new Naviti tribe consisted of Angela, Chris, Domenick, Donathan, James, Laurel, Libby, Morgan, and Wendell. At the new Naviti tribe, Chris tried to rally votes against Domenick, but his attitude set Angela and Libby off. Morgan was suspicious of Chris, and she and Libby aligned. At the new Malolo tribe, Bradley's complaining over Malolo's shelter got on some people's nerves, while Michael and Brendan found one of James's idols from China. Reward/Immunity Challenge: Castaways will need to jump between three sets of raised ramps to a sand pit, where they will need to dig out a heavy ladder. Using the ladder, one tribe member will need to retrieve a monkey\u2019s fist on top of a tripod, which they will use to climb the first ramp of the tower. The tribe will then need to hoist each other to the top of a second ramp, where two members will need to solve a tiki head puzzle to win immunity and a tarp. Malolo won the challenge; after they couldn't decide who from Naviti to send to Ghost Island, the Naviti members drew rocks to determine who would go. Chris drew the odd-colored rock, foiling Domenick's plan to blindside him. On Ghost Island, the urn Chris smashed was empty, and he opened up about his mother's struggle with multiple sclerosis. At Naviti, Angela wanted to stay strong with her old tribe members and vote out Libby, but Wendell saw Angela as Chris's \"right-hand man\", and started to rally votes against her. Meanwhile, Domenick showed his fake idol to the former Malolo members to build trust with them, but James didn't believe him and, seeing an opportunity to control the vote as Naviti was set to turn on Angela, pitched an idea to the other former Malolo members to vote out Morgan, which Libby objected to. However, at Tribal Council, Libby reluctantly sided with the majority, sending a shocked Morgan out of the game. Before her exit, Morgan willed the legacy advantage to Domenick.\n\n529 3 \" Trust Your Gut\" N/A 1.7/7[8] March 14, 2018 ( ) 8.39[8] 11[9]\n\nWhile attempting to regroup after Morgan's blindside, Domenick told Wendell he found a real idol. The next morning, he found the legacy advantage willed to him by Morgan. Reward Challenge: Two members of each tribe will start at their tribe flags on shore. Once told, they will need to make their way out into the water to get a ring. At least one castaway must be touching both the ring and their tribe's flagpole simultaneously to score a point for their tribe. The first tribe to score three points wins a feast of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches with ice cold milk. Before the challenge, Jeff revealed that someone would visit Ghost Island and return before the immunity challenge, meaning they would also be vulnerable if their tribe were to visit Tribal Council. Naviti won the challenge and immediately chose to have Malolo draw rocks; Kellyn was sent to Ghost Island immediately after she explained that being separated was her worst Survivor fear. Although the urn she smashed allowed her to play the game of chance, she decided not to risk losing her vote. At Naviti, a confused and angry Chris learned from Angela about Domenick's alliance's betrayal; they planned on aligning with the former Malolo members, but Donathan talked to Wendell about working together and Laurel talked to Domenick, who revealed his idol to her. Immunity Challenge: Castaways will have to swim out to a bamboo cage, hop over and dive in the cage to release a door underwater. They will then need to take a chest in the cage ashore, and race it across a track. On the track, tribes will need to use a grappling hook to connect a missing piece of the track allowing them to get the chest to a perch. Using the balls in the chest, they will need to get all five of them on top of a narrow perch to win immunity. Although Malolo had a huge lead through the chest-carrying stage, Naviti pulled off one of the largest comebacks in Survivor history and edged out Malolo during the ball-tossing stage to win immunity, largely thanks to Chris's efforts. Stephanie was put off by Bradley's arrogant attitude and was even more offended when Bradley flat-out told her there was no hope for her alliance. The Naviti majority wanted to weaken the other alliance and debated between voting out Michael or Brendan. Michael revealed his idol to Stephanie and Jenna, which gave the alliance hope. At Tribal Council, Brendan declared Sebastian and Chelsea to be on the bottom of an alliance led by Bradley, and Michael encouraged them to flip after he pulled out his idol, falsely calling it a double immunity idol in an attempt to throw the opposing alliance off their game. Before the votes were read, Michael played his idol for Stephanie, but the Naviti majority voted against Brendan instead, sending him out of the game.\n\n530 4 \" A Diamond in the Rough\" N/A 1.8/7[10] March 21, 2018 ( ) 8.61[10] 6[11]\n\nAfter Tribal Council, Michael apologized to the Naviti alliance if they felt offended by his gameplay, and he was upset with himself about making the wrong decision over who to play the idol for. Reward Challenge: Tribes will need to hop over a series of tables to a pile of large sandbags. They will then need to search through the sandbags to find a lever. Pulling the lever will release sixty smaller sandbags, which tribes will collect and use to hit a target that spins, raising a flag. The first tribe to raise all three flag wins coffee and pastries. Chris led Naviti to an easy victory. The tribe instantly decided to go to rocks to determine who from Malolo would go to Ghost Island. Stephanie was sent to Ghost Island; her urn was empty. At Naviti, Chris and Donathan bonded over having to take care of their families. Immunity Challenge: Starting on the beach, one runner from each tribe will grab a boogie board attached to a large spool of rope and race across a series of floating balance beams to a set of four satchels with numbered tiles. Grabbing only one satchel, the runner will get on the boogie board in the water, where their tribemates will have to reel them onto shore. Once the runner returns to shore, another person goes out. Once they have all four satchels, tribes will make their way to the finish deck, where they will used the numbered tiles to solve a combination lock, obtaining a key, which unlocks the tribe's sliding puzzle. The first tribe to finish their puzzle wins immunity. Naviti won immunity yet again. The Naviti majority debated on who to vote out; they decided that Jenna was an easy, safe vote, but Michael was the biggest threat. Jenna flirted with Sebastian to save herself, while Michael pled his case to Bradley, saying they needed him for the challenges. Desiree searched Stephanie's bag for an advantage and didn't find one. At Tribal Council, each of the original Malolo members pled their case, and Stephanie was unanimously voted out.\n\n531 5 \" Fate is the Homie\" N/A 1.7/7[12] March 28, 2018 ( ) 8.15[12] 15[13]\n\nOn Day 15, Jeff announced another tribe swap. The new Malolo tribe consisted of Angela, Desiree, James, Kellyn, and Michael. The new Naviti tribe consisted of Bradley, Chelsea, Domenick, Donathan, and Libby. A third tribe, Yanuya, consisted of Chris, Jenna, Laurel, Sebastian, and Wendell. On the newly formed Yanuya tribe, Chris's ego rubbed his new tribemates, especially Laurel, the wrong way. On the new Malolo tribe, Angela was still angry from her old tribemates' betrayal; she and James proceeded to inform their new tribemates about the cracks in the old Naviti tribe. Meanwhile, James was wary of Michael, as Michael had voted against him at Malolo's second Tribal Council. On the new Naviti tribe, Domenick immediately didn't trust Libby and voiced his concerns to Bradley. Immunity Challenge: One person from each tribe will be a caller, while the rest of the tribe is blindfolded. The caller, using only verbal commands, will need to lead their tribemates to three bags of puzzle pieces. Once they have all three bags, the caller will have two members of their tribe solve the puzzle, while blindfolded. The first two tribes to solve the puzzle win immunity. Wendell forgot one of Yanuya's bags, but he made up for the deficit, leading his tribe from last to first place, and Naviti placed second. Desiree was upset with herself over her poor leadership in the challenge, but Kellyn suggested to her and Angela that they vote out James, who later tried to bring Angela to his side. After a talk with Angela, Kellyn was skeptical of Angela's loyalty, but at Tribal Council, Angela stayed loyal and Michael joined the former Naviti members in blindsiding James out of the game.\n\n532 6 \" Gotta Risk it For the Biscuit\" N/A 1.7/7[14] April 4, 2018 ( ) 8.42[14] 11[15]\n\nAt Malolo, knowing he was the sole outsider, Michael searched for a hidden immunity idol. He managed to find Ozzy's fake idol from Micronesia, now a real idol. Reward Challenge: All members of the tribe will have to pull on rope on a balance beam to suspend a disc. They will have to stack blocks spelling \"REWARD\" on the disc with a skull on the top and another on the bottom, while pulling on the rope. If anybody falls off their balance beam or their block stack falls, they must start over. The first two tribes to finish their stack win; first place gets a grill, steaks, chicken kabobs, and spices. Second place gets chicken kabobs. Malolo lost yet another challenge. For placing first, Naviti had the power to send someone from either Yanuya or Malolo to Ghost Island; they unanimously decided to send Kellyn, since she had been there before. On Ghost Island, Kellyn was again given a game of chance to play. She was to pick from three urns instead of two; two held advantages, while one would cost her vote at the next Tribal Council. She won the vote stealer from Game Changers that Michaela failed to find, now downgraded to only an extra vote. At Naviti, Bradley's condescending attitude towards Donathan and Domenick rubbed them the wrong way. At Yanuya, Wendell took advantage of an opportunity to look for an idol while his tribemates were asleep. He spotted a unique tree and discovered a map to a hidden immunity idol at its base, which he then found. The idol was revealed to be the immunity necklace that Erik gave to Natalie in Micronesia. At Malolo, the tribe burned their flag's banner under Desiree's lead to reverse the curse of their losing streak. Immunity Challenge: Contestants must swim to a floating platform, run up it and jump off into the water. They must collect a set of floating rings and bring them back. Three people must swim over to a platform with the rings, and then toss the rings on to a floating target. The first two tribes to toss all their rings onto the target win immunity. Yanuya placed first and Malolo finally ended their losing streak, sending Naviti to Tribal Council. Bradley targeted Libby, but Chelsea talked to Libby about voting out Bradley. She and Domenick were later torn between voting out Libby or Bradley, but ultimately, they decided to unanimously vote Bradley out.\n\n533 7 \" Fear Keeps You Sharp\" N/A 1.6/7[16] April 11, 2018 ( ) 7.97[16] 10[17]\n\nOn Day 20, the three tribes merged on Naviti's beach. Although the Naviti members initially planned on picking off the Malolo members, Chris and Domenick were still at odds; Wendell tried to play moderator, to no avail. Chris found a note randomly placed in his buff, which led him to find a clue in tree mail, saying the idol was on Ghost Island; he would travel there late that night while everyone else was asleep. He found J.T.'s Game Changers idol in plain sight, but it was only good at the next Tribal Council. However, a game of chance allowed him to extend the life of the idol for up to 5 extra Tribal Councils; there were 10 chests to choose from. He extended the idol once, but lost his vote at the next Tribal Council. Immunity Challenge: Castaways must hold a boom pole over their head with a tiki statue at the end, while standing on a narrow perch. Every few minutes, the castaways will step forward. If they fall off the perch or their tiki statue drops, they are out of the challenge. The last person standing wins. Kellyn outlasted Libby to win immunity. Back at camp, Chris gathered everyone except Domenick and Wendell in an attempt to dictate a split vote between those two in case Domenick played his idol. While they were alone, Wendell told Domenick about his idol. Donathan immediately told them about Chris's plan to split the votes, while Desiree gathered the Naviti women to discuss a blindside of Libby, since everyone might be voting for either Chris, Domenick, or Wendell. At Tribal Council, Domenick openly wore his fake idol, then played the Legacy Advantage on himself, while Chris decided not to play his idol. Desiree and Angela voted against Libby, but everyone else voted against Chris, making him the first member of the jury.\n\n534 8 \" The Sea Slug Slugger\" N/A 1.6/7[18] April 18, 2018 ( ) 7.73[18] 12[19]\n\nAfter Tribal Council, Libby was concerned as to why she received votes again, while Wendell told Laurel about his idol, making her wary of his power in the game. Reward Challenge: Divided into two teams of six via schoolyard pick, castaways will have to race across a floating balance beam to shore. Once they are ashore, they will need to use a slingshot to knock over six blocks on a perch using sandbags, with each member being required to launch at least once, then return back to the beginning of the balance beam, where someone else goes out. The first team to knock all six blocks over win a feast of tacos, burritos, quesadillas, and margaritas. The team of Angela, Chelsea, Donathan, Laurel, Libby, and Wendell won reward. They immediately had the others draw rocks for Ghost Island, with Jenna getting exiled; her urn was empty. While on reward, Libby asked why she received votes, and Angela said the others were wary of her bond with Michael. Back at camp, Michael talked to Angela about blindsiding Wendell. However, after Michael told her she was the only person left out of the loop on the last vote, Angela wanted to \"stir the pot\" and lied to her old Naviti tribemates about Michael saying that Kellyn and Chelsea didn't trust Angela, planning to target him. Immunity Challenge: Castaways would have to eat exotic dishes and show their empty tongues to finish, in which a certain number of fastest finishers would advance to the next round. The castaway that finishes all stages wins immunity. Angela defeated Michael in the final round to win immunity. Angela's allies tried to sway Donathan to their side with an idea to split the vote between Michael and Libby. Michael pitched to the other former Malolo members to vote out Wendell, while Domenick assured Libby she was safe. Wanting to make a move and even the playing field, Donathan told Libby of Naviti's plan to split the vote between her and Michael, making Libby unsure of who to trust. At Tribal Council, the Malolo plan fell through as they joined the original Navitis in splitting the vote against Libby and Michael. Michael played his hidden immunity idol, negating the seven votes against him, sending Libby to the jury with four votes.\n\n535 9 \" It's Like the Perfect Crime\" N/A 1.6/7[20] April 25, 2018 ( ) 7.81[20] 9[21]\n\nThe morning after Libby's elimination, Desiree plotted with the old Malolo members to bring in Chelsea and Angela to overthrow the Naviti majority because she felt like she was on the bottom, but Laurel was skeptical. Reward Challenge: Divided into two teams of five via schoolyard pick, two members of each team will start in a canoe in the water, while the remaining three members are locked in a cage on a floating platform. The two paddlers will have to rescue their teammates, each of whom has a key. Once all three caged members are rescued, they will return to shore. Using the keys the teams have collected, they will unlock a large circus net that is holding puzzle pieces. They will have to carry the puzzle pieces to a frame, where they will solve the puzzle. The first team to finish their puzzle wins a helicopter flight to a bluff overlooking the islands and a picnic lunch. Since Donathan was not picked, he had no shot at reward, but was ineligible for Ghost Island. The team of Chelsea, Jenna, Kellyn, Michael, and Sebastian won reward; Angela got sent to Ghost Island via rock draw. While on reward, Michael told Chelsea, Kellyn, and Sebastian he was willing to work with them as an extra number, but Kellyn wanted to stay strong with Naviti and pick off the Malolo members. On Ghost Island, Angela played the game of chance but lost her vote after choosing the wrong chest. At camp, Laurel told Domenick about Desiree potentially turning on them, and Domenick told Kellyn, who was shocked. Michael started searching for an idol, and Donathan joined him, eventually finding Scot's idol from Ka\u00f4h R\u014dng. It was powerless unless Tai's matching idol from the same season, which was hidden under the shelter, completed the idol. After a while, Donathan found the second half of the idol, but was forced to tell the other old Malolo members about it as several tribemates shuffled in and out of camp. Immunity Challenge: The players will balance a ball on a disc attached to two ropes they must hold up. The last person standing with the ball still on the disc wins immunity. Chelsea won immunity. Kellyn confronted Desiree and Chelsea about turning on them, prompting Desiree to chew out Laurel in front of everyone else. Desiree adamantly tried to convince Kellyn she was loyal, while Domenick suggested a strong guy's alliance with Michael, to Kellyn's chagrin. At Tribal Council, Desiree and Laurel reignited their argument, but while Chelsea joined Desiree in voting against Michael, the rest of the tribe sent Desiree to the jury.\n\n536 10 \" The Finish Line Is in Sight\" N/A 1.5/7[22] May 2, 2018 ( ) 7.84[22] 14[23]\n\nAfter Tribal Council, Domenick expressed his gratitude toward Laurel for saving him, Wendell, and Kellyn, but Kellyn still wanted to pick off the old Malolo members. Domenick also considered turning against Wendell before looking for an idol. He found the fake idol Jay played in Millennials vs. Gen X, which still had no power, but Domenick had the opportunity to trick the other players with it. Before the challenge, Jeff announced a random draw of two \"tribes\" for that day only, each of which would go to Tribal Council, meaning two people would be eliminated that night and Ghost Island was not in play. Immunity Challenge: Castaways must pull up on a bar to keep a ball wedged between a set of jaws. If they release the bar, the lower jaw will fall, causing their ball to fall out. Once their ball falls, they are out. The last person remaining from each team wins immunity. Additionally, the last person left standing overall allows their team to view the results of first team's Tribal Council and vote second. Orange consisted of Domenick, Kellyn, Laurel, Michael, and Wendell, while Purple consisted of Angela, Chelsea, Donathan, Jenna, and Sebastian. Chelsea won immunity for Purple, but immediately dropped out before Domenick outlasted Wendell for the other immunity necklace and the right for Orange to visit Tribal Council last. Back at camp, Michael asked to borrow Donathan's idol, but Donathan immediately refused. To save himself, Michael told Kellyn he had an idol and would definitely play it. Kellyn bought Michael's ploy and told Domenick, who didn't believe it. She then told Chelsea and Wendell, and planned on using her extra vote to vote against Laurel twice, but Wendell considered turning on Kellyn to save Laurel. Meanwhile, Sebastian, Chelsea, and Angela planned on voting against Jenna, but they told her they would vote against Donathan. A paranoid Jenna tried to trick Donathan into playing his idol for her instead of himself at Purple's Tribal Council, while Donathan targeted Sebastian. At Purple's Tribal Council, Donathan played his idol on himself, negating Jenna's vote against him, and the Naviti members sent Jenna to the jury. At Orange's Tribal Council, Kellyn used her extra vote, creating a 2-2 tie between Laurel and Michael; on the revote, Michael was unanimously sent to the jury.\n\n537 11 \" A Giant Game of Bumper Cars\" N/A 1.5/7[24] May 9, 2018 ( ) 7.74[24] 13[25]\n\nBack at camp, Kellyn revealed to the others that she used her extra vote against Laurel, after being pressed by Domenick about there being six votes at a five-person Tribal Council. At the reward challenge, the castaways were reunited with their loved ones: Wendell's father Wendell I, Kellyn's brother Klay, Donathan's aunt Patty, Angela's daughter Paige, Chelsea's sister Sydney, Laurel's brother Frank, Sebastian's sister Grace, and Domenick's wife Kristin. Reward Challenge: While racing across a series of obstacles, castaways must untie and grab a sandbag. They will then attempt to throw that sandbag on a narrow table. The first castaway to get their sandbag on their table wins a feast of ribs, chicken, burgers, pastries, and ice cream with their loved one. Sebastian won reward and chose to share it with Domenick, Wendell, Donathan and their loved ones. Sebastian also had to send one of the other four to Ghost Island where an advantage will be available off the bat, unless he or one of the other reward participants volunteers to give up their reward. Wendell volunteered, and he received Malcolm's final immunity challenge advantage from Philippines. On reward, Domenick tried to align with Donathan and Sebastian, but Donathan was wary. At camp, Kellyn was bitter about not getting chosen for reward or for the advantage on Ghost Island; she and Angela plotted a girls' alliance out of revenge. Laurel weighed the pros and cons of turning on Domenick and Wendell. Immunity Challenge: Each castaway must balance a small metal ball on a wooden cylinder, while holding the center cylinder in place with two wooden handles. After a certain amount of time, new pieces of the wooden rod will be added, making it harder to balance the ball on the center cylinder. The castaway who balances their ball the longest wins immunity. Domenick won immunity. He and Wendell planned on bringing in Laurel to blindside Chelsea, while the women wanted to bring in Donathan to blindside Wendell. Donathan and Laurel privately weighed their options; Donathan was antsy to make a move, but Laurel wanted to stay true to her alliance with Domenick and Wendell. At Tribal Council, Donathan revealed there were cracks in the Naviti alliance, putting his tribemates on edge. In the end, Donathan and Laurel voted against Chelsea, sending her to the jury.\n\n538 12 \" Always Be Moving\" N/A 1.5/6[26] May 16, 2018 ( ) 7.54[26] 11[27]\n\nAfter Chelsea's elimination, Donathan approached Kellyn with a plan to turn against Domenick and Wendell. Reward Challenge: The castaways will be divided into three teams of two, where they will place a wooden spool onto a track which will roll to the bottom of the structure where one castaway will grab it and place it back onto the track. At regular intervals, more spools will be added, making it more difficult. If a spool drops, they're out of the challenge. Last team left standing wins the right to deliver supplies to a local Fijian school along with a meal of fried chicken and chocolate cake. Domenick and Wendell won reward; they chose Laurel to join them and sent Sebastian to Ghost Island. There was a 3 in 4 chance of getting an advantage, and Sebastian won Kellyn's misplayed extra vote that came back into play. While on reward, Laurel was secretly ready to turn on Domenick and Wendell. Back at camp, Donathan told Wendell he would cast his jury vote for Domenick over him, in hopes that they would turn on each other, but they saw through the plan. Immunity Challenge: Castaways will have to race out to two sets of tied planks, and use them to create a bridge to cross. Once they've crossed their bridge, castaways will have to complete two sets of ladders to climb a tower. At the top of the tower, they will then solve a slide puzzle. The first person to finish their puzzle wins immunity. Wendell finished the puzzle first, but Laurel called Jeff's name first; by that rule, Laurel won immunity. She wanted to stick with Domenick and Wendell out of gratitude, and the three of them targeted Kellyn. However, a paranoid Donathan asked Domenick and Wendell if they were going to blindside him, making them reconsider their plans. Donathan then caught Domenick rummaging through his bag and giving Wendell something, prompting him to go back to Kellyn. Domenick, Wendell, Sebastian, and Angela debated on whether to vote out Donathan or Kellyn at the hammock. At Tribal Council, Donathan's paranoia took over, and an argument ensued between him and Wendell, as Domenick urged everyone else to stick to the \"hammock plan.\" The vote was initially tied between Donathan and Kellyn, but Kellyn was sent to the jury on the revote.\n\n539 13 \" It is Game Time Kids\" N/A 1.4/6[28] May 23, 2018 ( ) 7.31[28] 7[29]\n\nThe final 6 returned to camp, where Sebastian secretly plotted on making a move against Domenick and Wendell, who in turn targeted him for his likeability. Reward/Immunity Challenge: Castaways must race through a large skull-shaped maze to collect three sets of bags. Once they collect all three bags, they must use the puzzle pieces to finish a vertical puzzle. The first castaway to finish their puzzle wins immunity and a steak dinner with baked potato, bread, and dessert. Wendell won immunity and chose to share reward with Sebastian and Angela. This upset Laurel, who voiced her anger to Domenick. Sebastian told Donathan and Angela he would use his extra vote to blindside Domenick, but Angela told Domenick, who considered playing his idol. Meanwhile, Donathan told Laurel about Sebastian's plan. At Tribal Council, Domenick outed Sebastian's extra vote and revealed his two idols, saying both were real when, in reality, one is fake. Wendell then pulled out his idol and offered to work with Donathan, who refused. Domenick presented the fake idol to Jeff before the votes were cast and chose not to play his real idol, and he was successful in fooling his tribemates. Sebastian didn't use his extra vote and was sent to the jury. Immunity Challenge: Castaways will swim out to a platform, then cross a series of obstacles, collecting two sets of puzzle pieces. Using the puzzle pieces, castaways must finish a four-piece pyramid puzzle. The first castaway to finish their puzzle wins. Wendell won immunity again. Donathan told Domenick he'd take him to the end after getting asked, while Wendell considered giving his idol to Angela, Donathan, or Laurel, but he and Domenick realized Laurel was their biggest threat in immunity challenges. At Tribal Council, Domenick played his idol on himself, while Wendell played his idol for Laurel, negating one vote against her. Ultimately, the rest of the tribe sent Donathan to the jury. Immunity Challenge: While standing on a wobbly beam, castaways must use a long fork to stack six sets of balls between stands on a free-standing structure. The first castaway to complete their stack wins. Everyone dropped their stack at least once, but Domenick managed to win his third immunity challenge, as well as the right to choose who to take to the end with him. The final 4 ventured to Ghost Island, where Laurel tried to convince Domenick that she wouldn't beat Wendell in the firemaking challenge. Angela tried to convince Domenick that Laurel was a bigger threat in the Final Tribal Council. A note told Domenick to choose one of three voting urns to be used at the Final Tribal Council, all of which were cursed due to a contestant taking the wrong person to the end; the urns were from The Australian Outback, Game Changers, and Cagayan. He chose the Cagayan urn. He also privately considered giving his immunity necklace to Angela and going to the firemaking challenge against Wendell. However, he chose to keep immunity and brought Laurel to the end; Wendell won the firemaking challenge, making Angela the 10th member of the jury. During the Final Tribal Council discussion, Laurel was largely ignored by the jury, who saw her as riding Domenick and Wendell's coattails, while Domenick was reprimanded for his actions at the Tribal Council where Sebastian was voted out. The jury went to vote, and Jeff surprised everyone by saying he would read the votes right then at the Final Tribal Council. For the first time in Survivor history, the vote was tied; Domenick and Wendell each had five votes. Jeff then instructed Laurel to break the tie as the 11th and final jury member.\n\n540 14 \" Reunion Special\" N/A 0.8/3[28] May 23, 2018 ( ) 4.62[28] 23[29]"}

{"label": true, "txt": "I don't know why I chose to watch the Miss Universe Pageant this past Sunday, December 20. I usually don't enjoy those types of shows, but I'm very glad I watched, because I was able to see Steve Harvey make his now-famous mistake in announcing the winner of Miss Universe 2015. My happiness has nothing to do with schadenfreude, though, as I take no pleasure in the suffering of others.\n\nThe reason why I felt fortunate to witness this incredibly awkward moment was because it illustrated to me an important lesson both in human frailty and in human resilience. It was one of the worst possible things that could go wrong -- a horrendous faux pas played out in front of an audience of millions, followed by a surprising and excellent recovery which I saw as tremendously reassuring.\n\nWhen we look at various lists our top fears, the fear of public speaking is always very close to the top, and it's because of of the underlying fear of making a fool of oneself.\n\nShame is a major source of anxiety for human beings. The sensation of shame is particularly painful because it includes not only feeling bad and stupid, but also small and ridiculous. Public shame is the worst of all. The anguish of being humiliated in front of our peers -- or, worse, those who we're hoping to impress -- can be excruciating.\n\nMany people avoid speaking in public altogether for the express purpose of not allowing themselves to be put in a position that might result in their experiencing shame. Many people would rather do just about anything than speak in public.\n\nSo, when Steve Harvey botched the announcement of the winner of Miss Universe 2015, he realized one of our worst fears: he looked really bad in front of the contestants, his bosses and millions of people all around the world.\n\nMr. Harvey did the thing that we all fear when we contemplate speaking in public. He messed up. But then he turned around and surprised us. He recovered.\n\nWe can be so anxious about the possibility of looking foolish in public that our thoughts go no further than to the dreaded possibility of public humiliation.\n\nWe can't imagine standing there, as Mr. Harvey did, with egg on our face, having demonstrated our ineptitude to the masses. Equally, we wouldn't have contemplated how we might react if such a situation were to occur. We simply imagine that we'd die, right then and there, or at least wish that we were dead.\n\nWhat Mr. Harvey showed us -- and why I was so happy to witness his big blunder -- was that we can mess up, look foolish and then we can make things right again.\n\nMr. Harvey showed us that it's possible for us to fall on our face but then stand up, brush ourselves off and carry on with our dignity intact. He showed us all-too-human fallibility, but also real class, courage and resilience.\n\nI was very impressed by the way Mr. Harvey handled his error. He owned up to it, apologized for it, explained what happened without being defensive, and even begged the audience not to blame his error on the contestants.\n\nHe took responsibility for what had happened and he did the right thing. He didn't try to save face, minimize his mistake or laugh it off. He was serious, humble and appropriately contrite. He knew he'd messed up, and he did his best to make things right.\n\nThat night, all of us who were watching the pageant collectively cringed as we witnessed Mr. Harvey's mistake. We felt horrible for the young women involved and embarrassed for Mr. Harvey.\n\nBut then, as I reflected upon what I'd just seen, I realized that, although it was an incredibly uncomfortable moment, it was also an enormously valuable lesson for all of us to take in.\n\nI really appreciate the way Mr. Harvey handled this situation. In fact, he did millions of people a huge favour. He realized one of our worst fears in as public a forum as one could imagine. And he didn't die. His head didn't explode. He didn't run off the stage and commit ritual suicide.\n\nNo, Mr. Harvey messed up, owned up, corrected the situation and survived. And he demonstrated to all of us that we too can mess up and survive, if we're willing to do the right thing, as he did.\n\nSo, Steve Harvey, thank you.\n\nI know you weren't planning on being such an excellent role model, but as is often the case when things go sideways, amazing surprises can happen. Amazing choices can be made and powerful lessons can be learned.\n\nThe next time I get up on a stage somewhere and I'm about to give a talk, I'll remember Steve Harvey and the Miss Universe 2015 pageant. I'll remember that the worst happened and nobody died. I'll take a deep breath and remind myself that if he could mess up in front of millions of people and survive, I really have nothing to worry about, after all.\n\nSign up here for my free monthly wellness newsletter.

The Shape of Water led the pack with seven nominations, including nods for best picture, director, and actress, all in the drama category. It was followed closely by The Post and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, two more dramas that picked up a respectable six nominations apiece. In the comedy categories, Lady Bird reigned supreme with four nods, although it may face stiff competition from I, Tonya\u2014which got three\u2014and The Greatest Showman, the upcoming P.T. Barnum musical starring Hugh Jackman.\n\nThe biggest shock in the film categories, however, were the three nods given to All the Money in the World, a Ridley Scott film that underwent hasty reshoots and edits this fall after Scott decided to replace star Kevin Spacey with Christopher Plummer, following a series of accusations of sexual misconduct against Spacey. The movie has not yet screened for critics\u2014but evidently, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association has seen it, and liked it well enough to cite it for best director, actress (Michelle Williams), and supporting actor (Plummer).\n\nOn the television side of the aisle, Big Little Lies\u2014of course\u2014got the most nominations, scoring six total nods. The Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u2014which, like Big Little Lies, recently won big at the Emmys\u2014was tied for most-decorated drama with This Is Us; each earned three nominations. Meanwhile, few comedies stood out from the pack; several series were give two nominations each, including Globes favorite Black-ish, Amazon\u2019s brand-new stunner The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Aziz Ansari\u2019s Netflix gem Master of None, the new Showtime hit SMILF, and NBC\u2019s well-liked revival of Will & Grace.\n\nBelow, find a full list of nominees.

{"label": true, "txt": "One of the most controversial aspects of fashion magazines, and the fashion industry, is models. Specifically, how young they are and how thin they are. It's a topic that continues to create endless debate, in the press and in the community. As the editor of Australian Vogue, my opinion was constantly sought on these issues, and the images we produced in the magazine were closely scrutinised. It's a precarious subject, and there are many unpleasant truths beneath the surface that are not discussed or acknowledged publicly.\n\nWhen I first began dealing with models in the late 1980s we were generally drawing from a pool of local girls, who were naturally willowy and slim, had glowing skin, shiny hair and loads of energy. They ate lunch, sparingly for sure, but they ate. They were not skin and bones. I don't think anyone believes that a model can eat anything she wants, not exercise and still stay a flawless size 8 (except when they are very young), so whatever regime these girls were following was keeping them healthy.\n\nBut I began to recognise the signs that other models were using different methods to stay svelte. I was dressing a model from the US on a beauty shoot, and I noticed scars and scabs on her knees. When I queried her about them she said, nonchalantly: \"Oh yes. Because I'm always so hungry, I faint a lot.\" She thought it was normal to pass out every day, sometimes more than once.\n\nOn another shoot I was chatting to one of the top Australian models during lunch. She had just moved to Paris and was sharing a small apartment with another model. I asked her how that was working out. \"I get a lot of time by myself actually,\" she said, picking at her salad. \"My flatmate is a 'fit model', so she's in hospital on a drip a lot of the time.\" A fit model is one who is used in the top designer ateliers, or workrooms, and is the body around which the clothes are designed. That the ideal body shape used as a starting point for a collection should be a female on the brink of hospitalisation from starvation is frightening.\n\nThe longer I worked with models, the more the food deprivation became obvious. Cigarettes and Diet Coke were dietary staples. Sometimes you would see the tell-tale signs of anorexia, where a girl develops a light fuzz on her face and arms as her body struggles to stay warm. I have never, in all my career, heard a model say \"I'm hot\", not even if you wrapped her in fur and put her in the middle of the desert.\n\nSociety is understandably concerned about the issues surrounding body image and eating disorders, and the dangerous and unrealistic messages being sent to young women via fashion journals. When it comes to who should be blamed for the portrayal of overly thin models, magazine editors are in the direct line of fire, but it is more complex than that. The \"fit\" model begins the fashion process: designer outfits are created around a live, in-house skeleton. Few designers have a curvy or petite fit model. These collections are then sent to the runway, worn by tall, pin-thin models because that's the way the designer wants to see the clothes fall. There will also be casting directors and stylists involved who have a vision of the type of woman they envisage wearing these clothes. For some bizarre reason, it seems they prefer her to be young, coltish, 6ft tall and built like a prepubescent boy.\n\n'I was horrified to hear what the industry was covering up' \u2026 Kirstie Clements, former editor of Vogue Australia. Photograph: Anthony Reginato / Newspix / Rex\n\nIt is too simplistic to blame misogynistic men, although in some cases I believe that criticism is deserved. There are a few male fashion designers I would like to personally strangle. But there are many female fashion editors who perpetuate the stereotype, women who often have a major eating disorder of their own. They get so caught up in the hype of how brilliant clothes look on a size 4, they cannot see the inherent danger in the message. It cannot be denied that visually, clothes fall better on a slimmer frame, but there is slim, and then there is scary skinny.\n\nDespite protestations by women who recognise the danger of portraying any one body type as \"perfect\", the situation is not improving. If you look back at the heady days of the supermodels in the late 80s and early 90s, beauties such as Cindy Crawford, Eva Herzigov\u00e1 and Claudia Schiffer look positively curvaceous compared to the sylphs of today. There was a period in the last three years when some of the girls on the runways were so young and thin, and the shoes they were modelling so high, it actually seemed barbaric. I would watch the ready-to-wear shows on the edge of my seat, apprehensive and anxious. I'm not comfortable witnessing teen waifs almost on the point of collapse\n\nCindy Crawford in 1999 \u2026 curvaceous compared to the sylphs of today. Photograph: Graham Whitby-Boot/Sportsphoto Ltd.\n\nAfter the shows, the collection is made available for the press to use for their shoots. These are the samples we all work with and they are obviously the size of the model who wore them on the runway. Thus, a stylist must cast a model who will fit into these tiny sizes. And they have become smaller since the early 90s. We've had couture dresses arrive from Europe that are so minuscule they resemble christening robes. There are no bigger samples available, and the designer probably has no interest in seeing their clothes on larger women. Many high fashion labels are aghast at the idea of producing a size 14, and they certainly wouldn't want to see it displayed in the pages of the glossies.\n\nAs a Vogue editor I was of the opinion that we didn't necessarily need to feature size 14-plus models in every issue. It is a fashion magazine; we are showcasing the clothes. I am of the belief that an intelligent reader understands that a model is chosen because she carries clothes well. Some fashion suits a curvier girl, some doesn't. I see no problem with presenting a healthy, toned, Australian size 10 [UK 8-10]. But as sample sizes from the runway shows became smaller, 10 was no longer an option and the girls were dieting drastically to stay in the game.\n\nIt is the ultimate vicious cycle. A model who puts on a few kilos can't get into a sample size on a casting and gets reprimanded by her agency. She begins to diet, loses the weight, and is praised by all for how good she looks. But instead of staying at that weight, and trying to maintain it through a sensible diet and exercise, she thinks losing more will make her even more desirable. And no one tells her to stop.\n\nGirls who can't diet their breasts away will have surgical reductions. They then enter into dangerous patterns of behaviour that the industry \u2013 shockingly \u2013 begins to accept as par for the course. We had a term for this spiral in the office. When a model who was getting good work in Australia starved herself down two sizes in order to be cast in the overseas shows \u2013 the first step to an international career \u2013 we would say in the office that she'd become \"Paris thin\". This dubious achievement was generally accompanied by mood swings, extreme fatigue, binge eating and sometimes bouts of self-harming. All in the quest to fit into a Balenciaga sample.\n\nNot every model has an eating disorder, but I would suggest that every model is not eating as much as she would like to. In 1995 I cast a lovely Russian model for a studio shoot in Paris, and I noticed that by mid-afternoon she hadn't eaten a thing (we always catered). Her energy was fading, so I suggested we stop so she could have a snack. She shook her head and replied: \"No, no. It is my job not to eat.\" It was one of the only sentences she knew how to say in English.\n\nA few years later we booked another Russian girl, who was also starving herself, on a trip to Marrakech. When the team went out to dinner at night she ordered nothing, but then hunger would get the better of her and she would pick small pieces of food off other people's plates. I've seen it happen on many trips. The models somehow rationalise that if they didn't order anything, then they didn't really take in the calories. They can tell their booker at the agency before they sleep that they only had a salad. By the end of the trip, she didn't have the energy to even sit up; she could barely open her eyes. We actually had her lie down next to a fountain to get the last shot.\n\nIn 2004, a fashion season in which the girls were expected to be particularly bone-thin, I was having lunch in New York with a top agent who confidentially expressed her concern to me, as she did not want to be the one to expose the conspiracy. \"It's getting very serious,\" she said. She lowered her tone and glanced around to see if anyone at the nearby tables could hear. \"The top casting directors are demanding that they be thinner and thinner. I've got four girls in hospital. And a couple of the others have resorted to eating tissues. Apparently they swell up and fill your stomach.\"\n\nI was horrified to hear what the industry was covering up and I felt complicit. We were all complicit. But in my experience it is practically impossible to get a photographer or a fashion editor \u2013 male or female \u2013 to acknowledge the repercussions of using very thin girls. They don't want to. For them, it's all about the drama of the photograph. They convince themselves that the girls are just genetically blessed, or have achieved it through energetic bouts of yoga and eating goji berries.\n\nI was at the baggage carousel with a fashion editor collecting our luggage after a trip and I noticed a woman standing nearby. She was the most painfully thin person I had ever seen, and my heart went out to her. I pointed her out to the editor who scrutinised the poor woman and said: \"I know it sounds terrible, but I think she looks really great.\" The industry is rife with this level of body dysmorphia from mature women.\n\nIn my early years at the magazine there was no minimum age limit on models, and there were occasions that girls under the age of 16 were used. Under my editorship, the fashion office found a new favourite model \u2013 Katie Braatvedt, a 15-year-old from New Zealand. We had her under contract: the idea being that Vogue grooms and protects the girls at the beginning of their careers. But in April 2007 I ran a cover of Katie wearing an Alex Perry gown standing in a treehouse, and received a storm of protest, from readers and the media, accusing us of sexualising children. I lamely debated the point, claiming that the photographs were meant to be innocent and charming, but in the end I had to agree wholeheartedly with the readers. I felt foolish even trying to justify it. I immediately instigated a policy that we would not employ models under the age of 16. Internationally Vogue has since launched a project called Health Initiative, instigated by the US Vogue editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour, which bans the use of models under 16 and pledges that they will not use models they know to be suffering from eating disorders. The first part you can police. The second is disingenuous nonsense, because unless you are monitoring their diet 24/7, you just can't be sure.\n\n'The deference she commands from people is astonishing to watch' \u2026 Anna Wintour. Photograph: Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images\n\nI had no dealings with Wintour during those years, and on the few occasions we were introduced, her sense of froideur was palpable. The deference she commands from people is astonishing to watch. There appears to exist some kind of psychological condition that causes seemingly sane and successful adults to prostrate themselves in her presence. It's not just respect \u2013 it's something else. People actually want to be scared witless of her, so she obliges. After they had met me, people would often say: \"You're so nice and normal\" \u2013 often I think with a tinge of disappointment, wishing I'd been just a little bit like Wintour. I could never win. I was either expected to be terrifying or snobbish. And I don't consider myself either.\n\nBeing a Vogue editor is precarious. It's a job everybody in the industry desires, and most people are convinced they could do it better. I was harder on myself than anybody would be if I made a mistake, and when you're the editor of Vogue, your slip-ups are very public. Traditional publishing is under enormous pressure, with declining revenues and readership, and decisions are being made to radically cut costs and do anything to please the advertiser. For me, this is perilous. I still believe in the magic.\n\nThis is an edited extract from The Vogue Factor by Kirstie Clements.

This is mad!\" said Irishman Hansard, before signing off with \"make art\".\n\n> Watch Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova's Oscars acceptance speech\n\nMark J. Terrill/AP\n\n9. Adrien Brody - The Pianist (2003)\n\nAdrien Brody's smooch with Halle Berry hit the headlines when he won the 'Best Actor' gong for Roman Polanski's The Pianist. \"I bet they didn't tell you that was in the gift bag,\" he told Berry, before calling Wladyslaw Szpilman \"the role of a lifetime\".\n\n8. Roberto Benigni - Life is Beautiful (1999)\n\nRobert Benigni unleashed pure joy when he won the Oscar for 'Best Foreign Language Film' in 1999, dancing across chairs and telling the entire auditorium he wanted to kiss all of them. It's the telecast cutaways that make Benigni's speech, with tears (Goldie Hawn), laughter (Gwyneth Paltrow) and bewilderment (Sophia Loren) all on show.\n\n> Watch Roberto Benigni's Oscars acceptance speech\n\nPeter Jordan/PA Archive\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n7.

The only problem? Both were still in the closet. This moment inspired Kevin Kline's 1997 comedy In & Out.\n\n> Watch Tom Hanks's Oscars acceptance speech\n\nReed Saxon/AP\n\n6. Gwyneth Paltrow - Shakespeare in Love (1998)\n\nThe tears came thick and fast as Jack Nicholson presented Gwyneth Paltrow with the 'Best Actress' Oscar. The waterworks began the moment her name was read out, but, like a total pro, Gwyneth was able to rattle through her fellow nominees, her cast, crew and Harvey Weinstein. The biggest heart-wrenching moments came later in her speech as she paid tribute to her family, her late cousin Keith Paltrow and college friend Harrison Kravis.\n\n5. Angelina Jolie - Girl, Interrupted (1999)\n\nBack before Brad, Angelina Jolie nabbed an Academy Award for her unhinged turn in Girl, Interrupted. Now we view Angelina as the epitome of poise and grace, but then she freaked everyone out with a gushing declaration of love for her own brother.\n\n4. Julia Roberts - Erin Brockovich (2001)\n\nAfter three nominations, Julia Roberts finally got her moment of glory and nobody was going to take it away from her. \"Sir, you're doing a great job but you're so quick with that stick so why don't you sit because I may never be here again,\" she told the orchestra conductor for fear of getting played off early.

This is for every nameless, faceless woman of colour who now has a chance tonight because this door has been opened.\" said a tearful Halle Berry in her Oscars acceptance speech. It was the first time a black actress had won the Academy's top award and came 63 years after Hattie McDaniel's 'Supporting Actress' victory for Gone with the Wind.\n\n2. James Cameron - Titanic (1998)\n\n\"I'm the king of the world,\" bellowed James Cameron as he won an Oscar for 'Best Director'. An act of extreme hubris? For sure. Instantly iconic? You bet.\n\n1. Marlon Brando - The Godfather (1973)\n\nBrando's 'Best Actor' Oscar victory for The Godfather was swamped in controversy as he refused to attend the ceremony, instead sending Native American civil right activist Sacheen Littlefeather to collect his trophy. Brando had become involved in the American Indian Movement, and used his win to protest their misrepresentation in Hollywood.\n\nLittlefeather initially planned to read out a 15-page speech but was told backstage by the producer that she would be ejected from the event. Award presenter Roger Moore revealed in his autobiography that he kept Brando's Oscar overnight and it was collected by an armed guard the morning after.\n\nThe 85th Academy Awards show will air live on ABC on Sunday, February 24."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Most of us didn't sign up for a whodunit when we began watching NBC's \"This Is Us,\" but it's sort of turning into one. The big, gaping plot hole that the show builds around is just how perfect-specimen-of-a-dad Jack Pearson met his maker.\n\n\"Before this season is over we will see how Jack Pearson dies,\" Sterling K. Brown said on the Golden Globes red carpet. Then Milo Ventimiglia on Saturday told Us Weekly the cause of Jack's death would be revealed \"very, very, very, very soon.\"\n\nWhile Tuesday's episode didn't completely divulge the backstory, it did reveal one more crucial piece of information. (Spoilers ahead!)\n\nIn the beginning of \"Clooney,\" Rebecca (Mandy Moore) and Jack (Ventimiglia) list items they need to buy at the mall -- batteries for Rebecca, a suit for Jack -- in what turns into quite the dramatic trip. Then off they go! Teenage Kate has a meltdown in a fitting room. Teenage Kevin drowns his injury-related sorrows with chicken wings then gets teary-eyed with dad. Teenage Randall asks a girl out using the ol' personalized Magic 8-ball trick (the kid's a genius).\n\nBack at home, Rebecca and Jack share a heartfelt moment after all that heavy-duty parenting. All seems well. Then Rebecca asks Jack if they forgot anything at the mall. Nope, he doesn't think so. Suddenly, we cut to a close-up shot of the smoke detector.\n\nNO. NO. NO.\n\nRebecca had told Jack not to let her forget the batteries. Then they both forgot. Combine this with what we've learned so far, and the pieces are clearly falling into place.\n\nJack's death was so traumatic that the family, in present day, can't talk about it. Heck, Kate hasn't even told the man she's going to marry what exactlyhappened. So the importance to the \"This Is Us\" story rests not just with the actual manner of Jack's death, but the circumstances surrounding it. The Rebecca-battery connection is one more addition to this.\n\nHere's a rundown of what we've learned about Jack's death so far, in chronological order by episode:\n\nSeason 1, Episode 5: \"The Game Plan\"\n\nCan you even remember a time before you realized Jack wasn't still alive? Well, this major plot point wasn't revealed until five episodes in, when Kate tells Toby that she likes to watch the Steelers games at home alone with her dad. Her dad, in this case, being the urn of his ashes she keeps on her mantle.\n\nSeason 1, Episode 6: \"Career Days\"\n\nKevin inadvertently crashes a memorial service, and ends up talking with the man's widow about her 15-year-old son. During the conversation, he reveals he used to build model planes and boats with Jack -- \"I used to pick the most complex ones,\" Kevin explains, \"because they took the longest. I was one of three kids so you really had to strategize to get your alone time with dad.\"\n\nWhile the pair eventually had a fleet of models, Kevin threw them all away after Jack died. \"I threw every one of them away, and I don't know why I did that,\" Kevin says. When asked how old he was, he simply responds, \"It was a long time ago.\"\n\nKevin points to his necklace as belonging to Jack's. \"It's the only thing I have left of him.\" It's a detail that maybe didn't fully register with viewers this early in the series, but it became clearer in Season 2.\n\nSeason 1, Episode 13: \"Three Sentences\"\n\nThis is the first time we get a sense of when Jack died. This episode ends with scenes from Jack's funeral, including Rebecca and her kids mourning. Kate, Kevin and Randall are clearly teenagers.\n\nSeason 1, Episode 17: \"What Now?\"\n\n\"You remember when I told you I couldn't talk about my dad's death?\" Kate tells Toby. \"Well, that's because it's my fault ... I'm the reason that he's dead.\"\n\nWhen she says these words, the flashback cuts to Jack thanking Kate for encouraging him to surprise Rebecca at an out-of-town gig. We're sort of led to believe that maybe something horrible happens on this trip. But we later discover that isn't the case, so Kate's feelings of guilt remain a mystery to viewers.\n\nSeason 2, Episode 1: \"A Father's Advice\" OK.\n\nThis is the big one when we see the immediate aftermath of Jack's death.\n\nRebecca is driving while wearing a Steelers jersey (the team, if you remember, are pretty important in Jack and Rebecca's relationship). The passenger seat holds a plastic bag with a few things presumably belonging to Jack: a watch, a set of keys, an American flag key chain, a wedding ring and a notebook. The items all seem unscathed and undamaged.\n\nThe kids, meanwhile, are at Miguel's house. Kate cries into her dog, and Randall weeps while holding the hand of a redheaded girl. Miguel, teary-eyed, shows up with linens and says he's going to find pillows.\n\n\"We have to find Kev,\" a crying Kate tells Randall. \"He needs to hear it from me.\" Kevin, meanwhile, is shown in his letterman jacket, with a cast and on crutches, kissing a girl (Sophie, the love of his life, right?).\n\nThen we cut back to Rebecca pulling over to the side of a road. She looks at the red mailbox reading \"Pearson,\" and the house completely gutted by a fire, and loses all composure, yelling and beating the steering wheel. The caution tape is still up, and a few firefighters assess the scene.\n\nSeason 2, Episode 8: \"Number One\"\n\nIt doesn't seem much is left of Jack, physically. Kevin has a meltdown when he realizes, in his rush to get more painkillers, he's likely left his father's necklace at the home of the woman he just slept with and walked out on after stealing her prescription pad.\n\n\"That necklace is the only thing I have left in my life from my dad,\" Kevin cries out in desperation. \"It's the only thing I have.\"\n\nSeason 2, Episodes 8, 9 and 10: \"Number One,\" \"Number Two,\" \"Number Three\"\n\nWe see the same day replay in these three episodes, including the lights cutting out in the Pearson house.\n\n\"Jack! Fuse!\" Rebecca cries out. \"Yup, I'm working on it,\" Jack yells back. Rebecca puts lit candles all around the house. Once the lights kick back up, Jack says, \"I think the power's gonna hold.\"\n\nCould it be a case of faulty wiring that burned the house down? Or all those candles? Or something else? And if so, why would Jack die in the house fire?\n\nSeason 2, episode 12: \"Clooney\"\n\nAs noted above, in this episode we're left with what feels like a big detail: The smoke detector needed replacement batteries."}

But even with his failure to secure an Oscar nomination for his work on \"The Disaster Artist,\" which previously earned him awards from the Golden Globes and the SAG Awards, a source says that the 39-year-old actor is more concerned about the snub being correlated to the sexual harassment allegations he has been facing recently.\n\n\"James is disappointed in not getting an Oscar nomination,\" a source close to the actor says, \"but also very understanding and somewhat relieved. He doesn't want it to look like the snub is correlated with the allegations against him.\"\n\nIt should be remembered that on Jan. 11, 2018, five women had accused Franco of sexual misconduct in an article published by The Los Angeles Times. Of the five women, four were here former acting students who all claimed that \"The Disaster Artist\" star had abused his authority and had exhibited inappropriate behavior towards them. Franco has denied these allegations but had claimed that he respects the fact that women are now being given a voice.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean that the allegations did not affect him. In fact, the source reveals that the actor has not been feeling well recently and is opting for a low profile while leaning heavily on his family for support.\n\nFurthermore, it has been reported that his close friends have been really worried about the actor, with one revealing how hurt Franco is. The source said, \"He is really hurt because he didn't know that we would be in a place where giving someone a voice would be giving someone a license to speak without any accountability.\"\n\nBut despite the allegations he has been facing, James Franco still managed to appear during the Screen Actors Guild Awards where he was nominated for an award."}

It is the sixty-eighth episode of the series overall.\n\nMonty strives to show Wonkru an alternative to war, and to the valley itself. Meanwhile, Abby's health continues to deteriorate, along with McCreary's patience.[1]\n\nContents show]\n\nPlot Edit\n\nOctavia is contemplating her next move when Miller and Brell bring bad news that there are now divisions among Wonkru. Some of them want to follow the real commander, Madi. Brell suggests that the only way to unite Wonkru behind Blodreina is to remind them the rule - that anyone against Wonkru is an enemy of Wonkru. That means, she should put the traitors - Bellamy, Indra and Gaia - to fight to the death in the pit. She would then use fear to make Wonkru follow her.\n\nWhile the plan might work, Octavia is worried that Bellamy might die. She still cares deeply about him. So, she goes to Indra to look for ideas on a different strategy. She brings up how Indra accepted her and trained her as her second when her own people didn't believe in her. She gets teary as she wonders why Indra would betray her. Indra doesn't have a way for Octavia out of this. She warns Octavia that she plans to kill Bellamy and let Gaia kill her. That way, she doesn't lose a daughter. This gets Octavia even more worried. Since she knows Indra's weaknesses, she asks Monty to go tell Bellamy to help him win. But Monty refuses and asks Octavia to face Bellamy herself. Monty then shows Octavia that he's been able to revive the hydrofarm and it's just a matter of time before the ground above is ready for growing crops as well. So, there is no need to fight for the valley. He shows Octavia an apple blossom flower that he had been able to grow... but Octavia plucks it and walks out, angrily.\n\nOctavia is left with no choice but to go talk to Bellamy herself. She starts by reminding him of how he used to protect her when she was a kid. She wonders why he's changed so much that he would poison her. Bellamy insists that he hasn't changed. He only did it to protect her. She's the one who changed by becoming Blodreina. Octavia tries to help him win the fight by telling him Indra's weakness - Indra's shoulder is still weak since she was shot by Pike years ago. She asks Bellamy to take advantage of that and kill Indra during the fight to the death. Bellamy refuses and insists that he won't fight. He asks Octavia to call off the fight instead if she really wants to save him. Octavia replies \"Will see\" and walks out. She starts crying. She then slits her wrists and paints her face with the blood, ready for the fight.\n\nBefore the fight in the arena, Bellamy wants to convince Indra and Gaia that they should all refuse to fight to see if Octavia would actually execute them herself. Indra admits that Octavia might not kill her or Bellamy but she would kill Gaia. So, Indra concludes that she must kill Bellamy to save her daughter. She promises to make it quick. She then strategizes with Gaia on how to fake a convincing fight before killing her. Gaia insists that all she cares about is to keep Madi safe... and that means killing Octavia. But Indra advises her against it because Octavia's guards would kill her right away. Octavia announces the start of the fight. After fighting for a couple minutes, Gaia is knocked down, but after regaining consciousness, she throws a spear aimed at Octavia. Luckily, it misses Octavia. Instead of retaliating, Octavia orders her guards to stand down; and instead throws the spear back on the floor and asks Gaia to continue fighting.\n\nSuddenly, Monty and Harper interrupt the fight. They are carrying flowers from the hydrofarm. They reveal to everyone that the hydrofarm can now be used to grow food; and that Octavia knew about it, too. This makes Octavia lose credibility among Wonkru. Everyone starts going against her, marking the end of the fight. In retaliation, Octavia heads straight to the hydrofarm and burns it down, leaving them with no choice but to follow her to fight for the valley.\n\nDisheartened, Octavia packs her things and starts walking towards the valley. Miller follows and invites anyone else who would like to join them. Since they have no choice, they all follow Octavia as they march towards the valley.\n\nMeanwhile at the valley, McCreary takes away Abby's drugs until she agrees to treat him. So, Abby uses Vinson to bring the drugs to her by pretending that he's coming for a medical check up. Unfortunately, Vinson gets busted by McCreary's guards. They attack him and he starts biting them. Abby uses the opportunity to get her hands on the drugs.\n\nOn their way to the valley, Madi insists that she wants to go back to the bunker to help her people but Clarke forces her to stay in the rover. They find that Octavia had kept the worms inside a bottle in the trunk. Clarke drops the bottle, releasing the worms onto the ground. Madi then starts getting scary memory flashes of the commanders before her - including Lexa and even Becca - because of the flame. When she mentions her plans to remove the flame, Madi asks her to destroy it because otherwise she will put it back in. However, when Madi goes to sleep, Clarke is unable to remove the flame after noticing Madi crying. Clarke tells Madi that she thinks of her as her child and she doesn't want to see her die young and horribly like the other commanders.\n\nUpon arriving at the valley, Clarke and Madi are shocked to see McCreary's people killing the defectors. When one of the prisoners is left to bury the dead, Madi and Clarke approach him and force him to tell them what's going on. He explains that McCreary is in charge now and that Diyoza is in hiding. They ask where to find Abby. After that, Madi kills him immediately. Clarke and Madi head to the gas station medical room. They find Abby lying on the floor, unconscious, due to overdosing.\n\nCast Edit\n\nStarring Edit\n\nGuest Starring Edit\n\nBarbara Beall as Brell\n\nAlbert Nicholas as Cosser\n\nStew McLean as McCreary's Guard #1\n\nDarian Martin as Royal Guard\n\nJesse Stretch as Huge Wonkru Guard\n\nMichael Patric as Nash\n\nMonique Ganderton as Aurora Blake (archive footage; uncredited)\n\nOlivia Steele Falconer as Young Octavia (archive footage; uncredited)\n\nJulia Dominczak as Anthem Singer (uncredited)\n\nHugo Raymudo as Hugo (uncredited)\n\nQuotes Edit\n\nPaxton McCreary (to Abby) : \"You don't look so good, Doc.\" Abigail Griffin: \"That makes two of us.

Because for as long as we\u2019ve been watching them on TV, it seemed like they were doomed to fail.\n\nThe couple met on season 2 of BIP in 2015 \u2014 and as viewers are well aware, it was pretty much love at first sight for Iaconetti. But while they went on dates (even an overnight one!), Haibon wasn\u2019t quite as enamored.\n\nAshley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon on Bachelor in Paradise season 2 (2015) Rick Rowell/ABC/Getty\n\nAshley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon on Bachelor in Paradise season 2 (2015) Rick Rowell/ABC/Getty\n\nThe result? A seemingly endless flow of tears from Iaconetti, who developed a reputation for sobbing in confessionals over her unrequited love.\n\nNevertheless, the two remained friends even after things didn\u2019t work out \u2014 and viewers could hardly believe their eyes when they learned that the pair would both return for season 3 of BIP the following year. But if you thought things would be different this time, think again.\n\nFor yet another summer, fans watched Iaconetti pine over Haibon, unapologetically sabotaging his chances with fellow contestant Caila Quinn. But still, Haibon resisted Iaconetti\u2019s advances, and it seemed all but obvious that these two would never work out.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Ashley Iaconetti Explains Why She \u2018Friend Zoned\u2019 Former Bachelor Ben Higgins\n\nFinally, Iaconetti decided it was time to move on. In late 2017, she jetted off to film another ABC spinoff, The Bachelor Winter Games, where she met Kevin Wendt. The two started dating \u2014 just as Haibon had begun to realize that maybe what he was looking for had been in front of him all along.\n\nThe giddy duo recapped their journey for fans in a tear-filled episode of Iaconetti\u2019s show The Story of Us, and Haibon admitted Iaconetti\u2019s new relationship felt like \u201ca kick in the a\u2014.\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember I heard rumors that she might have met somebody, and I was sad,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes I need a kick in the a\u2014. That was a big kick in the a\u2014.\u201d\n\nAfter production on Winter Games wrapped, Haibon and Iaconetti reunited for a formerly planned vacation to St. Lucia with Iaconetti\u2019s sister Lauren and Bachelor alums Tanner Tolbert and Jade Roper in January.\n\n\u201cGoing into St. Lucia, I did a lot of self-reflection \u2026 trying to figure out what I want, what I should do, if I should do anything,\u201d Haibon said of weighing whether or not to tell Iaconetti about his feelings for her. \u201cIt\u2019s so unfair for me to say anything.

Enter Andy Cohen, who had the 58-year-old rocker on Watch What Happens Live on Tuesday (June 26), broaching the subject head on. \"There are many rumours that you and Princess Diana were once romantically involved,\" the host asked. \"Her butler said that he used to sneak you into Kensington Palace. How would you characterize your relationship with Princess Diana?\"\n\nThe \"Summer of '69\" singer was quick to clear the air.

The 43-year-old Danish model explained, \"Bryan knew Paul Burrell very well and Paul was part of the inner circle around Bryan, and he also introduced him to Diana. The first time Bryan met Diana, I wasn't invited. Ours was a stormy relationship and Bryan's affair with Diana didn't make it easier.\"\n\nDespite this knowledge, Cecilie stayed with Bryan and even accompanied him to Diana's funeral in 1997. \"I was sitting in the church with mixed emotions.\""}

He was just an amazing man.\"\n\nKnight appeared on Season 3 of Project Runway, which aired on Bravo, finishing fourth that year. He returned for Project Runway All-Stars, finishing eighth on the show that now airs on the Lifetime network.\n\n\"We are saddened to hear about the passing of a member of the Project Runway family,\" said Lifetime spokeswoman Dee Perez in a statement. \"It's a loss of a great talent and we wish his family peace and solace during this difficult time.\"\n\nKnight spent his childhood in Montgomery, Alabama, but graduated from Washingtonville Senior High School in Washingtonville, New York, in 1996. Later that same year, he began his freshman year of college at Georgia Southern University in Statesboro, Georgia. In 2001, he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in apparel design and merchandising.\n\nAfter completing his undergraduate studies, Knight broke into the fashion industry in Atlanta by working as an intern at Wilbourn Exclusives in 2001 before becoming a fashion stylist in the music industry in 2002.\n\nIn 2006, Knight became a contestant for Project Runway, and went on to win that season's fan favorite award. The next year, he introduced his label, Mychael Knight, on BET's Rip the Runway and he designed a line of custom tees for the Starbucks Corp.\n\nIn 2008, Knight launched Kitty & Dick, his lingerie label for men and women, and his unisex fragrance, MajK.\n\nMadison said Project Runway definitely helped expand Knight's brand, which caught the eye of celebrities like Toni Braxton, Sheri Shepard and Eva Marcille, who ultimately became his clients.\n\n\"His name was still on people's minds,\" Madison said. \"The industry is very competitive, but he continued to do it his way.\"\n\nMadison said Knight, who had been living in Los Angeles, was always sharp and chic in his personal style and that carried over into his collections.\n\n\"He died doing what he loved,\" Madison said. \"And you can see that in his final collection presented (last month) at New York Fashion Week. It was amazing. The industry has lost a true innovator. Mychael was just getting to that point where people were saying 'Hey, I remember this guy.' He was about to be huge and really wanted to capitalize on affordable sportswear for women of all sizes.\"\n\nIn addition to his parents, Michael Sr. and Pamela Knight, Knight is survived by two sisters.\n\n\"Mychael meant everything to us and we loved him dearly. He was generous and so full of life. This is how we choose to remember his legacy,\" the family said in a statement.\n\nFuneral arrangements were pending.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2x4cZWG"}

During its run, the series was one of the network's highest-rated programs,[2] with the fifth-season premiere seen by a record 9.8 million viewers, the most watched show of that evening including broadcast television, twice as many viewers as the show\u2019s previous series high.[3]\n\nAfter the Gosselins' divorce in 2009, the final episode of Jon & Kate Plus 8 aired on November 23, 2009, announced by TLC three days earlier.[4][5]\n\nThe series was later renamed Kate Plus 8 on June 6, 2010,[6] focusing on Kate as a divorced mother raising the children, with Jon appearing less frequently.[7] However, filming was later suspended due to Jon's lawyers delivering letters to TLC demanding that they cease and desist production and barred production crews from the couple's Pennsylvania property on October 1, 2009.[8][9][10] This led to putting the show's revamping on hold. TLC planned for \"a series of specials\" if the series did not go into production.[11]\n\nThe second season of Kate Plus 8 premiered on April 4, 2011, though on August 15, TLC announced that the series would be cancelled after it reached 150 episodes. The last episode aired on September 12, 2011.[12]\n\nOn March 19, 2014, it was announced that Kate and her eight would return in a reunion special, scheduled to air in June.[13]\n\nIn August 2014, it was announced that Kate Plus 8 would return for another season (its third, and first after an almost three-year hiatus) on January 13, 2015 on TLC.[14]\n\nSeason 4 of Kate Plus 8 started on December 8, 2015.[15]\n\nSeason 5 of Kate Plus 8 started on November 22, 2016.[16]\n\nSeason 6, with three episodes, started July 10, 2017.[17]\n\nFamily [ edit ]\n\nParents\n\nChildren\n\n# Name Date of birth 1 Cara Nicole ( 2000-10-08 ) October 8, 2000 (age 18) 2 Madelyn \"Mady\" Kate 3 Alexis Faith ( 2004-05-10 ) May 10, 2004 (age 14) 4 Hannah Joy 5 Aaden Jonathan 6 Collin Thomas 7 Leah Hope 8 Joel Kevin\n\nProduction [ edit ]\n\nBetween the specials and the series, permanent light fixtures were installed in the Gosselins' second home to make filming easier and prevent the kids from tripping over the wires and cables from temporary lighting. Jon & Kate Plus 8 filmed three days per week, with one day used for interview sessions where Jon, Kate and occasionally the children, discussed events occurring in each episode. In the family's first house, the \"interview corner\" was located in the basement, and was transformed from the playroom when needed. It was painted green, unlike the rest of the playroom. In their new house, the interview set was reproduced in an unfinished area of the basement. At season four's finale, Jon and Kate said they would make a new set for season five.\n\nCriticisms were raised regarding Kate's intentions of continuing with the show, as well as whether or not the children were being exploited or were under emotional distress.[18] According to lawyer Gloria Allred, \"Every state does regulate to protect the health, the safety and welfare of little child performers [...] And these little ones are only eight years old and five years old, they can\u2019t protect themselves, so the state has to be sure that they are safe in their workplace.\"[18] In the case of the show, the children's workplace is their home. At this point there are no clear laws in Pennsylvania (where the Gosselins reside) regarding a child's appearance on a reality show.[19] However, Pennsylvania law permits children who are at least seven years old to work in the entertainment industry, as long as certain guidelines are followed and a permit is obtained. For example, children may not work after 11:30 p.m. under most circumstances, or perform in any location that serves alcohol.[19]\n\nKate and Jon Gosselin in 2008\n\nKate says that the children were happy and healthy and were never in any danger from doing the show. Jon stated they were \"in talks\" regarding ensuring the children's happiness,[18] and that there is no truth to any reports that the children have been hurt by the series.[20] TLC released a statement saying that the network \"fully complies with all applicable laws and regulations\" to produce the show. The statement also said that \"for an extended period of time, we have been engaged in cooperative discussions and supplied all requested information to the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry\".[19]\n\nAn investigation by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Labor Law Compliance found that \"The activity being filmed was spontaneous. However, children introduced episodes of the television show and transitions. DVDs and other merchandise were sold involving the children's appearance. Lighting was placed in the home for the show and there was product placement in some episodes.\"[21] Because of these reasons, the children were considered to be working on the show, and the show was required to obtain work permits for the children, which it did not do.[21] An agreement was reached that no charges would be filed immediately as long as no further violations would occur.[21]\n\nMultimedia [ edit ]\n\nBooks [ edit ]\n\nThe Gosselins were managed by Media Motion International in Los Angeles.[22]\n\nKate Gosselin has written four books: Multiple Blessings (co-authored with Beth Carson and Jon), which was released November 1, 2008, Eight Little Faces in April 2009, I Just Want You to Know on April 13, 2010 and Love is in the Mix a cookbook, on September 13, 2013.\n\nDVDs [ edit ]\n\nTitle Region 1 Region 2 Discs Jon & Kate Plus 8: Seasons 1 & 2 September 9, 2008 2008 2 Jon & Kate Plus 8: Season 3 February 3, 2009 2009 4 Jon & Kate Plus 8: Season 4, Volume 1 - The Wedding May 5, 2009 2010 3 Jon & Kate Plus 8: Season 4, Volume 2 - The Big Move July 21, 2009 2010 2 Jon & Kate Plus 8: Season 5 - Big Changes January 12, 2010 2010 2\n\nOnline releases [ edit ]\n\nEpisodes of the series are available for download from the iTunes Store, Google Play, Amazon Video, and Microsoft Zune Marketplace."}

She will stay on the World Cup circuit for a while. She needs six World Cup victories to pass Ingemar Stenmark\u2019s record of 86. She is a three-time Olympic medalist. And with her bronze in the downhill, the 33-year-old became the oldest skier to win a medal in an Alpine event.\n\nVonn won Olympic gold in the downhill at the 2010 Games and, after missing the 2014 Olympics because of a knee injury, this was a chance to gild her stellar racing career with another Olympic gold.

{"label": true, "txt": "We can hardly fathom the incredible amount of clothes and accessories that exist in the individual studio-apartment-sized closets of each of the Kardashian-Jenner women. To consider the wardrobe that Kim, Khlo\u00e9, Kendall, Kylie, Kourtney, and Kris have combined among them is downright mind-blowing. We can probably agree that we'd jump at an opportunity to raid any one of their walk-ins, which lucky for them is their sisterly birthright.\n\nThrough the years of KUTWK, we've watched them all swap, steal, share and squabble over clothes just like all female family members do. But what's it like to \"borrow\" from your mom and sister when everything they own is seriously expensive, if not one-of-a-kind? And when they have so many clothes and bags and shoes that they might not even notice something was missing if you snatched it? Is the Kardashian kloset-sharing experience anything like our own?\n\nIn a recent interview with People Style, Kendall Jenner dished on all the juicy details, including which sisters have the best selection of what pieces and who is the worst about sharing her clothes.\n\n\"Khlo\u00e9 has the best shoe selection and she's my size,\" the model revealed. \"Kourtney has good statement pieces. Kim has amazing things you could never find [elsewhere].\" Jenner also admitted to occasionally dipping into her mother Kris's collection of diamond jewelry.\n\n\"Everyone's very generous,\" she said.\n\nWell, almost everyone.\n\n\"We're all super-generous minus Kylie,\" Jenner clarified with a laugh. \"Kylie and I always fight over clothes. It's, like, a problem. But it's because we grew up together and we just grew up fighting over clothes.\"\n\nWho could forget their infamous throw-down before the ESPYs when Kendall boldly attempted to borrow one of Kylie's \"favorite brown dresses\"? (It's worth noting that we can't recall ever seeing Kylie wear a brown dress.)\n\nBut then it was Kylie who swiped Kris's vintage neon Body Glove swimsuit for a quick trip to Mexico. (Typical youngest child move.)\n\nSeems like the Kardashian women are pretty similar to the rest of us when it comes to the rules and emotions involved in opening your closet to others\u2014except it's Balmain they're borrowing/loaning and not a $10 tee from Forever 21."}

When I was pregnant, I went out with friends still, not going like too crazy like in clubs in stuff\u2013but I did do that once! I allow myself to have fun. I allow myself to feel beautiful. I have pictures on my phone where I kept taking pictures of my body. And I felt so beautiful pregnant.\n\nAfter you have the baby you've got to take care of yourself, too. We forget about that. You're so wrapped up in being pregnant but you have to remember after you have that baby, you have to take care of yourself and that's internal, external, mental, physical, emotional.

{"label": true, "txt": "Netflix's original series \"Stranger Things.\" Netflix Netflix will raise prices for its US subscribers starting Thursday, the company confirmed to Business Insider.\n\nThe price of the lowest-tier plan will not change from $7.99 monthly. But the most popular, the \"standard plan,\" which allows HD and two simultaneous streams, will increase to $10.99 a month from $9.99.\n\nThe highest-tier plan, which supports features like 4K video resolution and four simultaneous streams, will increase to $13.99 a month from $11.99.\n\nMashable first reported the price increase.\n\nNew subscribers will see the price increase go into effect on Thursday. Current subscribers will start being notified on October 19, and it will take effect in their next billing cycle.\n\nNetflix's price increases always spark drama.\n\nIn October 2015, Netflix raised its prices for new members and then embarked on a process of \"un-grandfathering\" existing customers into new prices. When the bulk of that process happened last year, media and public chatter rose to such a degree that Netflix blamed it for a missed quarter of subscriber growth.\n\n\"People don't like price increases \u2014 we know that,\" CEO Reed Hastings said on an earnings call last year.\n\nPeople may not like them, but price increases will most likely continue to be necessary as Netflix spends more and more on content \u2014 close to $7 billion next year, according to its content boss, Ted Sarandos. Funding its original productions is not cheap, and Netflix has made big moves recently, like poaching the TV power player Shonda Rhimes from ABC and buying the comic-book publisher Millarworld.\n\nStill, despite the price increase, Netflix will remain a much better deal than cable in terms of viewing time.\n\nIn a report this summer, UBS analysts found that an average pay-TV package cost over three times as much per hour of viewing as Netflix. The per-hour cost of traditional packages was about $0.42, while that of Netflix was about $0.10.\n\nThat lead is not likely to be hurt too much by a $1 or $2 price increase.\n\nHere's a chart from UBS that shows how Netflix prices have fared relative to cable prices over time:"}

(We\u2019ve never wanted to be someone\u2019s ex more in our lives.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had no bad breakups in my life,\u201d said Evans, who\u2019s dated Kate Bosworth, Jessica Biel, and, most recently, his \u201cGifted\u201d co-star Jenny Slate.\n\n\u201cTypically, if I see an ex, I give a big hug, and it\u2019s wonderful to catch up,\u201d the 35-year-old told the magazine. \u201cIf you\u2019re ever fortunate enough to love someone and have them love you back, it\u2019s worth protecting that. It\u2019s rare that someone can truly know you. And if you\u2019ve broken through that kind of wall, I think it\u2019s important to value that.\u201d\n\nIt sure seems like he does. The actor has spoken of Slate in only glowing terms while promoting \u201cGifted\u201d the last few months.

Just like many others, Dornan too had a typical awkward teenager story.

On one particular day, I was in an amateur drama play and was going to a party after. For my role, I had bits of a black wig glued to my face for a beard and I decided to keep it for the party so I would look older. I also decided to cut up the rest of wig and glue it to my private parts just in case I got lucky\u201c.\n\nThat reckless move backfired on the young Brit when it came time to remove the improvised pubic hair. \u201cI didn\u2019t get lucky and removing the bits of wig ripped out the very small amount of natural hair I had down there. It was a physically and emotionally painful experience!\u201d\n\nDuring the interview, the handsome star also shared about the \u201cawful\u201d scene to shoot in \u201cFifty Shades Freed\u201c.

{"label": true, "txt": "The political intrigue on \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d is one of its strongest draws. The constant back-and-forths between the people who see the Iron Throne as their right, and the masterful manipulations they employ to get there, have made up some of the show\u2019s most shocking moments.\n\nThat\u2019s why when you look at the data to confirm who in Westeros and Essos has done the most backstabbing, it\u2019s easy to see who\u2019s holding the knife.\n\nVenngage, an infographics firm, compiled a list of every \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d betrayal in order to map out the manipulations and deaths among six seasons. When pointing them out, you can see all the people who were at the receiving end of the most betrayals and the ones that were at the throwing end.\n\nAlso Read: Game of Thrones: Cersei Lannister's Character Evolution, as Told Through Her Wardrobe\n\nAccording to that data, Varys \u2014 Master of Whispers and known spider \u2014 has raked in the most with seven. This includes the complicated plan where he testified against Tyrion in Season 4, then helped Jaime Lannister to free Tyrion, only to get him to Daenerys in Meereen.\n\nConsidering he\u2019s been in the Lannister\u2019s employ and lives in King\u2019s Landing, it makes sense that most of his plans have been against the Lannisters. He was also partially responsible for selling Daenerys off to Khal Drogo in Season 1.\n\nAnother high roller in the betrayal department includes another non-surprise \u2014 Petyr Baelish, who comes in with six. If you remember all the way back to Season 1, his first major backstabbing was against Ned Stark (\u201cI did warn you not to trust me\u201d was only the beginning of the end).\n\nAlso Read: 'Game of Thrones' Ratings: How HBO Show Has Grown By Epic Proportions\n\nHonorable mentions include Tyrion, who has four, Ellaria, who has three and Cersei, who has six. The latter gets special consideration for manipulating almost everybody in King\u2019s Landing and killing them all off in a giant explosion at the end of Season 6.\n\nBetrayal is such an important aspect of living in Westeros that the only way to adapt is to learn the art. Both Sansa and Arya have low numbers on the list, but are working their way up. Arya spent most of Season 6 working on her skills, while Sansa finally got her freedom after the Battle of the Bastards.\n\nThe data also goes in the other direction, showing who was the butt of most schemes.

He\u2019s been moving work commitments to spend as much time as he can around Stormi.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cGoosebumps\u201d rapper and the Life of Kylie star love hanging with Woods too. Earlier this month, the threesome jetted off to Cannes, France, together to support Scott\u2019s performance at the Spotify beach party. In fact, Woods spends so much time around the couple that she teased on Twitter in April she\u2019s \u201ccoming down with some form of [baby] fever.\u201d\n\nJenner showed her appreciation for the model back in March when she flaunted a ring with the initials \u201cJW\u201d to honor both Woods and Scott, whose real name is Jacques Webster.\n\nGo back into the Us Weekly archives and revisit some of the best bombshell stories, riveting feuds and couplings with our new podcast \u201c#TBT!\u201d\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!"}
{"label": true, "txt": "Reuters Brie Larson at Golden Globes Awards 2016\n\nThe first look at Brie Larson as Captain Marvel is here, but those who are expecting to see her in the character's red, blue, and gold suit might be disappointed.\n\nLarson was photographed recently while filming the upcoming movie in Atlanta and she was outfitted in black and green. For those who are out of the loop, there is a reason why Captain Marvel is in this costume.\n\nWhile it looks weird for some, it is actually not a deviation from the comics. Savvy comic book readers will recognize that the color scheme matches the old costume by the original Captain Marvel, aka Mar-Vell, before he switched it out for a red and blue one. According to reports, Carol Danvers herself donned a similar suit before she upgraded it to the most recognizable gear."}

But believe it or not, the newbie told The Daily Dish earlier this summer that she wasn't all that bothered when she initially found out about Shannon's friend Nina's comments at the '70s party.\n\nBut her husband Michael Dodd and her new friend Vicki Gunvalson saw the situation differently, telling Kelly that regardless of the fact that she was never a prostitute, people might still think it's true if the rumor gets out there. \"It got me really angry,\" Kelly said (clip above). \"I'm thinking to myself, 'OK, how could I ever be a prostitute? I got married when I was 25 to my first husband. I went to college. I worked for Gannett newspapers. Like, how could this ever happen to me, because I've worked my whole life and had a professional job. And how could this ever happen for someone to say something so cruel when I have a daughter out there, and it's vicious lies, and my integrity is getting ruined.\"\n\n\n\nThe Real Housewives of Orange County Kelly Dodd Lashes Out at Shannon Beador Kelly confronts Shannon at Meghan's dinner.\n\nKelly said she was most concerned about how the rumor would affect her 9-year-old daughter Jolie. \"I really got angry because I thought about my daughter and if my daughter hears something so disgusting like that,\" she said. \"And I was so upset [about] Shannon bringing this woman to this party that I just [blew] a gasket. I just [blew] a gasket.\"\n\nKelly said she also didn't understand why Heather Dubrow asked her to leave the restaurant. \"The lady's not gonna tell me what to do,\" Kelly said. \"She's not above me.\"\n\n\n\nThe Real Housewives of Orange County Heather Is Disgusted by Kelly's Behavior Heather Dubrow is not okay with Kelly Dodd's actions at dinner.\n\nNow looking back at how chaotic the night got, does Kelly regret what she said to her castmates during Meghan's party? \"Yes, of course. In hindsight, I'm like, 'Why did I say that?' I shouldn't have said something like that. It makes me look bad,\" Kelly explained. \"But I said it out of anger and frustration and it was the first thing that comes out of my mouth, and I didn't think first before saying it, so I regret saying that to her, yes.\"\n\nBut does Kelly see a friendship with Shannon in her future?

Paramount Network released the a NSFW trailer for the adaptation of the 1988 cult comedy on Thursday, January 18, and the claws are really coming out.\n\nThe NSFW video provides the first glance at Shannen Doherty\u2019s return \u2013 and yes, she\u2019s still wearing the red bow. She\u2019s also carrying a gun! \u201cWhatever you do, make sure it matters,\u201d the actress says.\n\nSeries creator Jason Micallef has kept very quiet about what role Doherty will be taking on in the dark reboot, but did confirm she\u2019ll be in three episodes. \u201cShe is in the very first scene of the very first episode. That\u2019s all I got for you,\u201d he told reporters at the 2018 Television Critics Association\u2019s Winter Press Tour on Monday, January 15.\n\nIn November 2016, Doherty shared the first photo from set, writing, \u201cJealous much?\u201d\n\nThe show will put a fresh spin on the high school classic, Micallef noted. \u201cIt\u2019s 2018, it\u2019s not 1988.

However, original film fans should keep a keen eye out. \u201cThis show is like a love letter to the original movie.

The outfit, which has a purple flower on it, wraps loosely around her chest and has laces crisscrossing in the front.\n\nKim said on Wednesday night the dress just looks like a corset and 'she would never' put her daughter in one.\n\n'This dress that I did not design, I actually bought, is not a corset it\u2019s just fabric on the front,' she said in a video.\n\nShocked: Photos of North West wearing a corset have prompted outrage on social media, with users wondering why Kim Kardashian and Kanye West let their step out in the accessory\n\nKim hit back at her haters Wednesday night, posting a video explaining the dress was just fabric\n\nKim showed off the dress in a short video she posted on Twitter Wednesday night, explaining it's 'just fabric'\n\n'So, I think it\u2019s really cute, I bought it from a designer and it\u2019s just fabric people, it\u2019s not a real corset.\u2019\n\nShe also tweeted: 'I would never put my daughter in a corset! Relax it's a dress I bought that is fabric that laces up and looks like a corset!'\n\nCorsets are designed to sexualize the female body and are often worn by burlesque dancers - and many social media users say the item is inappropriate for a child so young. The clothing cinches a woman's waist to make them look smaller and enhance their bottom.\n\nKim herself has advertised waist trainers, a type of corset, on social media, and credited them with helping shape her hourglass figure.\n\nDoctors, however, have warned against waist trainers and pointed out that they could cause serious damage to internal organs.\n\nOutfit: The four-year-old can be seen in a recent set of photos walking on the street with a corset on top of a peach-colored dress.

'We are starting to dress babies in corsets and satin. Watch people say its [sic] a trend.'\n\nOne Instagram user, however, tried to defend the corset by pointing out it is sewn onto the dress and thus doesn't hurt anyone.\n\nBut another person shot back: 'Kids need their innocence protected and too many pedophiles will see this and God knows what will happen !! Kids can dress cool, but not sexual OK!'\n\nAlong with the contentious corset and dress, North wore a black hat and a pair of customized sneakers bearing her name written in pink letters.\n\nMessage: The social media firestorm came as Kim was forced to clear things up after some of her social media followers claimed to see lines of cocaine on a table in one of her posts\n\nFamily: Kim also has a one-year-old son, Saint, with Kanye. The family is pictured posing together in their Easter 2017 shot, which Kim shared on social media\n\nKim Kardashian has previously been seen wearing corsets and advertising them on social media\n\nThe social media firestorm came as Kim was forced to clear things up after some of her social media followers claimed to see lines of cocaine on a table in the background of one of her posts.\n\nKim shared a video on Twitter on Tuesday, explaining that the white streaks spotted on a black table at a hotel she's staying are just part of the table's marble stone.\n\nOn Monday, she initially suggested the streaks might be leftover sugar from some candy her kids were eating.\n\n'Come on.

It also means fans will see a resolution after Raver's character Teddy returned with a shocking pregnancy twist after mysteriously arriving from Germany in the season 14 finale.\n\nTeddy reveals she came back to Seattle to ask if there was a job opening at Grey Sloan Memorial. Bailey (Chandra Wilson) tells Teddy that her coming to Seattle for a job is one more sign that she should take some time for herself, which leads to her announcing she's taking a sabbatical from being Chief of Surgery.\n\nShe says she takes the necessary steps to ensure she will have a long life despite her health scare, but she hasn't really done anything or changed her life since then.\n\nBailey shares she wants to stop listening to the voice of the patriarchy telling her she can't pause and offers Teddy the job of Interim Chief of Surgery.\n\n\"I want to take a sabbatical from stress,\" Bailey says. \"I want to do research... and fall in love with the O.R. again.

{"label": true, "txt": "Warning: The following contains spoilers for the season 5 finale of The 100. Read at your own risk!\n\nWell\u2026 after multiple apocalypses, nuclear wars, and environmental disasters, it\u2019s finally time to leave the ravaged and barren trash planet once known as Earth behind. In the season 5 finale of the CW\u2019s The 100, Clarke (Eliza Taylor), Bellamy (Bob Morley), and the survivors of the human race made it off the planet just in time to escape nuclear fallout.\n\nBut their plan to go to cryo-sleep and wake up when Earth is habitable again failed, and Monty (Christopher Larkin) secretly charted a new course for his sleeping friends after figuring out the Eligius\u2019s real mission: to find and settle on a different planet light-years away, nestled in a binary star system. And so, when Clarke and Bellamy wake, they find themselves headed for a completely new home \u2014 a home that may not be ready for them to call it home just yet.\n\nBelow, The 100 showrunner Jason Rothenberg discusses how the writers decided to move on from Earth entirely; where Clarke, Bellamy, and Octavia (Marie Avgeropoulos) can go from here; and what \u201cEnd of Book One\u201d meant for the series.\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: What inspired this ending, to leap forward 125 years, to lose Monty and Harper, to introduce us to their son, and to effectively start all over, but with a new planet and two suns?\n\nJASON ROTHENBERG: There was a confluence of things we were trying to solve. One of them was we didn\u2019t know whether it was going to be a season or a series finale, so I needed the ending to be a satisfying piece of storytelling, and at the same time tee up something that was really mysterious and enticing for the audience and, to be honest with you, for the powers that be at the network and studio.\n\nThat\u2019s part of the dance, from an inside-baseball perspective. But [our narrative] threads \u2014 the spaceship with cryo-sleep on it that had come back from an interstellar mission, the two armies fighting over this one valley \u2014 naturally led us to this idea of going to explore another world. It was in the DNA of The 100 that when we say something bad\u2019s gonna happen, it happens. So as I was breaking the season with the writers last year, they were like, \u201cWe have to destroy the Valley.\u201d That just made the most logical sense.\n\nRight, humans would squabble over something so pivotal that they end up destroying it. Was that what you were hoping people took away from this ending?\n\nYeah. I mean, we\u2019re all on this planet together, and yet we don\u2019t care what we\u2019re doing to the atmosphere. One of the things we were trying to say \u2014 and it\u2019s a little bit of a nihilistic opinion of the human race \u2014 is that man couldn\u2019t overcome their innate instincts to make war.\n\nThe last shot has a card saying, \u201cEnd of Book One.\u201d We\u2019ve never seen anything like that before \u2014 what did you mean by that?\n\nIt also could have said, \u201cEnd of Planet One.\u201d We have the opportunity to create a new world, literally in this case, and it\u2019s a binary star system, so we\u2019re gonna play with what that means in an interesting way. There\u2019s definitely life on that planet. We can see that from space in the finale.\n\nBattlestar Galactica is a huge influence of mine, and so is Interstellar, and I was also really influenced by the movie Annihilation, which I thought was great. It\u2019s inspiring us. The idea is we can really do anything, because life takes endless forms and environmental threats can come from anywhere. Some of it is beautiful and some of it isn\u2019t, just like on our planet.\n\nInteresting! And what are you calling the planet?\n\nI can\u2019t tell you \u2014 that\u2019s a spoiler for next season. But we are going in search of Eligius III, with the hope that Eligius III made it to this planet and populated it and were able to survive. We\u2019ll join what is essentially the next outpost for humanity. The story for season 6 is in many ways about what happened to Eligius III and how we interact with what happened to Eligius III. Are there survivors? What are the threats in the woods? Are there woods here? Are there things that don\u2019t exist on Earth? You better believe there are. We\u2019re going to really lean into sci-fi world-building with this planet.\n\nDiyah Pera/The CW\n\nSadly, in order for the survivors to find this new planet, Monty and Harper had to say goodbye. How did actors Christopher Larkin and Chelsey Reist react to leaving their characters behind?\n\nIt\u2019s always hard to write a character that\u2019s beloved off a show, and in this case two of them. Chris and I had big, long conversations about it before we started \u2014 I have sit-downs with all the series regulars at the start of the season \u2014 but Chelsey, who wasn\u2019t a series regular but was certainly a huge part of our show\u2019s family, when I finally figured out what the ending was going to be, I called her.\n\nShe was on her way to work, and I remember she kind of knew what the call was about \u2014 they all know when that call comes in, it\u2019s not like we talk on the phone very often \u2014 and she had to pull over. She was sad, and it was a hard conversation, but then I pitched her what it was, and I sensed a shift in her on that call. Like, she realized how potentially powerful and emotional and beautiful it would be, giving these two people a happily-ever-after, which is not something the show traffics in, you know? And once we started doing it, it was the most emotional day I\u2019ve ever experienced on set. I think it was for everybody involved.\n\nIt\u2019s a shock for Bellamy and Clarke, certainly, but at least they\u2019ve reconciled. What is their dynamic going to be like going forward? In a way, they now have Madi and Jordan to take care of as, like, their kids.\n\n[Laughs] That\u2019s a funny way to think about that. Jordan is a child in many ways, even though biologically he\u2019s as old as they are, but he\u2019s experienced nothing. Madi\u2019s far more developed emotionally. And Bellamy and Clarke have always been the center of the show, and their relationship is so important to everything we do. When they\u2019re in alignment and have the same goal, things work out; when they\u2019re on opposite sides, it\u2019s usually a s\u2014show. [Laughs]\n\nSo right now, they\u2019re back to being in alignment, but a lot of other characters are not going to forgive Clarke as readily as Bellamy has, and that is something we\u2019re going to keep an eye on as season 6 begins. But they will go forward with Monty\u2019s wish for them to do better. They\u2019ll be committed to that course \u2014 Clarke, I think, even more strongly than Bellamy going forward.\n\nWhat makes their relationship so unique at this point in the series?\n\nAt the moment, they\u2019re in their development as people. They are partners, and sometimes I say they\u2019re best friends. They\u2019re certainly not romantic yet. I think personally that that is unique and rare and different than what you normally see in opposite-sex leading roles in television shows, you know? And obviously a lot of people in our fandom still ask that question and yearn for that, and I get that and appreciate that and love that they watch the show, but I can\u2019t make any promises one way or another. Where they are right now is my favorite place for them to be, which is non-romantic partners and soulmates aligned, going in the same direction.\n\nDiyah Pera/The CW\n\nBellamy and Octavia, though, still have a ways to go. What kept you from giving them a scene where they completely patched things up?\n\nI feel like that relationship took a while to break, and it\u2019s going to take a while for it to recover. Octavia has not yet really reconciled with what she\u2019s done. She was going to sacrifice herself for them, and she got that taken away from her. On some level, we\u2019re going to play with this a lot in season 6. She\u2019s kind of pissed off and still bitter that people don\u2019t accept that she did keep them alive, that she took on all of that misery so the people in the bunker wouldn\u2019t break. To me, she\u2019s going to need to come out of that on the other side before Bellamy can fully accept her.\n\nAlso, part of Bellamy\u2019s journey is that [his sister] was always his touchstone. No matter what he did, we were going to forgive him because it was for her, for the sister he loved, and we loved. He needs to move on from that too \u2014 that\u2019s not owning your own life \u2014 so he needs to figure out who he is independent of that. The two of them need to come back together and have a grown-up relationship. He\u2019s lived as her father his whole life, but he\u2019s her brother, and she\u2019s her own person too. That\u2019s where the journey begins for them next season.\n\nNow, just to clarify: Is McCreary dead?\n\nClarke squashed his melon, but that said, you didn\u2019t see a body at the end. So\u2026 I suppose the door is open.\n\nUh oh. What about Kane? He\u2019s in a medically induced coma, and actor Henry Ian Cusick is on a new series. Should we brace ourselves for an exit?\n\nI think it\u2019s too early to say. For sure he\u2019s in The 100 next season as we begin the journey, and I love him as an actor and what he\u2019s brought to the show. He\u2019ll always be a core member of The 100 family, and we\u2019re going to figure out [his schedule].\n\nWhat about Diyoza and her baby? Her fetus is now, what, the oldest fetus in the world?\n\nIt\u2019s 200 years old! [Laughs] Two hundred years old and five months. And yes, everybody who\u2019s alive at the end of season 5 is in season 6.\n\nFianlly, with the \u201cEnd of Book One\u201d card and this reset in mind, how long do you see The 100 going on for?\n\nThe truth is that I used to have an ending in mind, but we passed that ending a while ago, and yet the show keeps staying, for me, creatively challenging and exciting. As long as it is that for me, I will stay on this show, and the show will stay on the air, given [the CW boss] Mark Pedowitz\u2019s desires. For me, shows should have an ending, and they should not go on forever, and when you start repeating yourself too much, then that\u2019s time to walk away. But at this point, that\u2019s one of the reasons we put \u201cEnd of Book One\u201d on that screen, because it really is the end of one adventure and the beginning of another."}

For real. Blake Shelton looks like a server at a Cracker Barrel in Gatlinburg. \u2014 nascarcasm (@nascarcasm) November 15, 2017\n\nBlake Shelton looks like a guy who gets shredded by everyone on Shark Tank for the outrageous valuation he places on his pre-revenue floating \u201cbeer cup\u201d that he invented after his wife left him, and it doesn\u2019t get much sexier than that. \u2014 Gabe Delahaye (@gabedelahaye) November 15, 2017\n\nblake Shelton looks like your middle school bus driver who got fired for buying four loko for the intimidating 8th graders who sit on the back of the bus https://t.co/fQCpg4Xx2g \u2014 maggie (@MaggieShmaggie) November 15, 2017\n\nOf course, People is routinely derided for its choice of Sexiest Man Alive, which is a transparently PR-driven exercise often jokingly equated to a \u201cbest publicist\u201d award. As such, each year\u2019s choice invites a wave of alternate opinions, and 2017 is no exception, with social media users being quick to point out other, sexier alternatives to Shelton:\n\nThe same people who voted in People\u2019s sexiest alive man list are the same folks who tampered w/ the presidential elections\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s no way Blake Shelton is the sexiest man w/ Trevante Rhodes still breathing. pic.twitter.com/cd5NTcKJp4 \u2014 Corey Townsend (@JarrieBradshaw) November 15, 2017\n\nTwitter users had many opinions on who the actual sexiest men of the year were, but a general consensus seemed to form around the triad of perennially overlooked frontrunner Idris Elba, upcoming Aquaman actor Jason Momoa, and the usual gaggle of white guys named Chris:\n\nForget the fact that Idris Elba should\u2019ve obviously won. I can even think of like 5 white guys named Chris who are more deserving of the Sexiest Man Alive title than Blake Shelton. \u2014 Brohibition Now (@OhNoSheTwitnt) November 15, 2017\n\nBlake Shelton is People\u2019s Sexiest Man Alive because apparently Idris Elba, Chris Evans and Jason Momoa fell off the planet last night. \u2014 Jenn C (@TheJennC) November 15, 2017\n\nBut despite the jokes, there\u2019s plenty of reason beyond the subjective nature of sexiness to be critical of People\u2019s decision \u2014 namely because Shelton has been flagrantly and repeatedly homophobic in the past, once \u201cjoking\u201d in a 2011 tweet that he would leave any gay man who tried to touch him beaten and bloody.\n\nHe also used the stage at the Country Music Awards for an awkward gay joke about Jake Gyllenhaal because he starred in Brokeback Mountain, and has repeatedly referenced gay panic and jokes about finding lesbians hot on his Twitter account. In the past, he\u2019s made toxic jokes about women, including noting, in 2010, a \u201csick fantasy\u201d about then-16-year-old Dakota Fanning, and has repeatedly made Islamophobic and xenophobic jokes about non-English-language speakers and foreigners around him.\n\nLast year, after the tweets were uncovered and public outcry arose, he attempted to pass off all of his statements as comedy. Yet since then he\u2019s gone on to openly decry \u201cpolitical correctness,\u201d and last year praised Donald Trump for \u201csay[ing] what he thinks,\u201d without acknowledging the coded racism and bigotry that often underlies Trump\u2019s statements.\n\nAfter the news about Shelton\u2019s new title began circulating, many began pointing out the singer\u2019s problematic history:\n\nI guess it makes sense in Trump's America that an Islamophobe who \"jokes\" about beating up gay men would be named the \"Sexiest Man Alive.\" \u2014 Melissa McEwan (@Shakestweetz) November 15, 2017\n\nFor anyone who wants to shame people for making fun of the fact that Blake Shelton is \u201cSexiest Man Alive\u201d (barf) remember that he\u2019s a giant homophobe who once wrote a parody to \u201cAny Man Of Mine\u201d by Shania Twain that describes him assaulting men who show interest in him. FYI. \u2014 Sexiest Man Alive, Dan Blackroyd (@danblackroyd) November 15, 2017\n\nJust in case you guys didn't know, not only did Blake Shelton tweet racist & homophobic things he also made jokes about having \"sick fantasies\" about Dakota Fanning when she was 16 \u2014 Tatum Robinson (@TatumAlexis10) November 15, 2017\n\nStill, some were quick to point out that it\u2019s not the first time People has made odd decisions in its annual Sexiest Man vote. For starters, the list has historically been overwhelmingly white, with only two men of color ever gracing its cover \u2014 Denzel Washington in 1996 and The Rock in 2016. This fact, combined with backlash over Shelton, had many onlookers pointing out how problematic the list has historically been.\n\njust a reminder that only two men of color have been picked as the sexiest man alive in 32 years, people magazine is trash https://t.co/TVDNNcCMch \u2014 adam (@brokeangeI) November 15, 2017\n\nNot to mention how weird some of the choices have been:\n\nClearly, People\u2019s Sexiest Man award is yet another public institution that needs to be dismantled and rebuilt from its sexy foundations."}

The Honolulu-born Australian actress and Oscar winner, most recently nominated for her supporting role in \u201cLion,\u201d and the platinum-selling New Zealand-born country music superstar purchased the almost 36-acre, two-parcel spread in two 2007 transactions that totaled $2.45 million.\n\nA long drive meanders through a pristine stand of woods and swoops across an open field as it makes its way to the front of a red-brick residence with four bedrooms and four full and two half bathrooms in not quite 5,100 square feet. The traditional exterior belies the clean-lined, open-plan and decidedly modern interior spaces that include a steeply pitched vaulted and skylight-pierced ceiling in the living room, a stainless steel-accented fireplace in the family room and a window-lined dining room that flows into a galley-style kitchen with speckled granite counters on stainless steel cabinets.\n\nBedrooms are well separated for privacy, and include a top-floor master suite that comprises a sitting room, separate bedroom, luxury bathroom and immense walk-in closet perfect for a couple of frequent red-carpet walkers.

{"label": true, "txt": "Like little sister Kylie Jenner before her, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian has turned to the life-changing magic of a good platinum dye job to prep for the oncoming holiday season and close out 2018 on a brighter, lighter note. On Monday, Kardashian shared videos on her Instagram Story in which she simultaneously showed off her newly blonder hair color and bounced daughter True Thompson on her hip, in an impressive feat of motherly multitasking. Though Kardashian didn't go into detail about her hair change, she did quip, while sporting an Instagram filter that sent diamonds shooting out of her face in every direction, that the animation captured \"how I feel with this new hair.\"\n\nTracey Cunningham , hairstylist to the stars, was significantly more effusive. She reposted two of Kardashian's selfie videos on her own Instagram page, writing in one caption, \"@khloekardashian I love you #platinumblonde I love doing your hair color.\" Cunningham went on to explain the extensive process of layering various highlights on different sections of Kardashian's hair, from roots to ends, in order to achieve the chic icy shade, adding, \"You were so patient.\"\n\nThe color change, it seems, was enough of a makeover for Kardashian for now. Perhaps not wanting to spend even more time in Cunningham's chair, Kardashian seems to have opted to retain her pre-platinum mid-length style rather than hopping on the current celeb-favorite lob train .\n\nLoading View on Instagram\n\nLoading View on Instagram\n\nKardashian's lighter look comes only a few weeks after Jenner transformed her own locks into a similarly light blond shade. Though Jenner's 'do is somewhat more silvery than Kardashian's pale yellow color, both kept a bit of their darker natural shades at the roots. But don't expect the sisters to be twinning forever: Only a few hours before bleaching her hair in mid-November, Jenner shared a few throwback photos of her as a brunette and hinted, \"Almost ready for my dark hair.\"\n\nLoading View on Instagram\n\nAnd the platinum blonde trend stretches far beyond the Kardashian-Jenner family. Just last week, Hilary Duff documented her own hours-long process of going blonder . \"The winter white out is complete,\" she captioned a shot of the final product, which was masterminded by Riawna Capri and Nikki Lee, cofounders of L.A.'s Nine Zero One salon. Still other newly \"icy\"-tressed stars include Rose Byrne , Sophie Turner , and Pete Davidson .\n\nRelated: A Brief History of All the Times the Kardashians Have Gone Blonde"}

{"label": true, "txt": "Going all the way back to 1937, Hollywood has been in love with the rags to riches story of \"A Star Is Born.\"\n\nThe movie that follows the overnight success of an aspiring singer has been done by the likes of Judy Garland (in the 1954 version) and Barbara Streisand (1976), and now Lady Gaga has added her name to the roster.\n\nWe know Gaga for her incredible singing and stage persona, but for at least the rest of this year she'll also be lauded for her acting abilities. She's incredible as Ally, who is discovered by the singer-songwriter Jackson Maine (played by Bradley Cooper), who mentors her into a superstar. The two eventually also fall in love.\n\nAnd if Gaga's acting ability comes as a surprise, get ready for another \u2014 Bradley Cooper can direct (wait for it...) and sing!\n\n\"A Star Is Born,\" which opens in theaters October 5, marks the actor's directorial debut and he crushes it as he weaves together a story filled with emotion and heartache about love, ego, stardom, and acceptance.\n\nFollowing the 1976 rock-and-roll musical version, which was nominated for four Oscars and won for best original song, the project was looking to be told once again in a modern setting. Names like Clint Eastwood were floated as a potential director, and Beyonc\u00e9, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Will Smith were all rumored to star over the years, but for the most part the project lingered in development hell. But in 2016 it was announced that Cooper had signed on to not just star but also direct and the project was on the fast track, nabbing Gaga along the way.\n\nThe movie is fueled by the chemistry between Cooper and Gaga, who performed many of the songs featured in the movie in front of live audiences. Cooper holds his own in the singing department and brings a lot of empathy to his drug and alcohol-addicted rocker character with a troubled past. But it's watching Gaga belt out the ballads with ferocious intensity that will give you goosebumps.\n\nAlong for the ride is Sam Elliott, who plays Bobby, Jackson's older brother and the one person who has looked out for him his whole life as their father was a drunk. Cooper gives Jackson a deep, twangy voice that's almost spot on to how Elliott talks, which just adds fuel to the authentic feel of the brothers' love-hate-relationship.\n\nIn the other versions of this movie, much of the focus is on the female character. But in this one, the pulse is Jackson, whose self-destructive life only brings Ally closer to him, until finally it's too much for her to handle. The last third of the movie is heart-wrenching to watch, but you can't turn away as Cooper delivers a tour-de-force performance that will certainly garner him an Oscar nomination.\n\nIn fact, there might be a lot of Oscar notice for this movie. Along with Gaga and Elliott's top-notch work, the original songs are fantastic, and the editing flawlessly delivered the fast-moving lifestyle the two main characters live.\n\nThe hype for this movie is already through the roof, and all I can say is it lives up to it."}
{"label": true, "txt": "Dean Unglert, green-eyed Ken doll and America\u2019s boyfriend, is on many people\u2019s short list to be the next Bachelor. And I mean, why wouldn\u2019t he be? He\u2019s smart (I think). He\u2019s handsome. He\u2019s funny. He\u2019s handsome. Did we mention handsome? Where was I? Oh yeah, this dude began his Bachelorette tenure with a vaguely racist comment and he would STILL be a better Bachelor than the last like, five dudes we\u2019ve had (minus Ben, you\u2019re perfect). Let\u2019s see\u2026 he doesn\u2019t have a speech impediment, isn\u2019t a raging misogynist, and also isn\u2019t responsible for anyone\u2019s death as far as we know, so sign me tf up. And by me I mean him. But also me. To compete on his season. Yeah, okay, you get it. Moving on.\n\nLast night\u2019s Men Tell All didn\u2019t reveal who the next Bachelor would be, so it\u2019s no surprise that #DeanforBachelor was trending on Twitter during the episode. I\u2019m honestly just surprised that enough people were able to break themselves away from the spell Dean\u2019s eyes cast upon them for long enough to create a hashtag, but I would like to thank those heroic Americans for their service to this country. But will Dean Unglert be the next Bachelor? Sorry, Deanie Babies. It\u2019s not looking likely. Let\u2019s look at the evidence.\n\nExhibit A: Dean is on Bachelor in Paradise. While I\u2019m fully aware that being on Bachelor in Paradise does not preclude you from becoming The Bachelor, having Dean be on The Bachelorette and then Bachelor in Paradise two weeks later and THEN be The Bachelor seems like a lot. He would have to have Nick Viall levels of blackmail material on everyone working at ABC in order to pull that off, and I just don\u2019t see that happening for a relative rookie to the franchise. However, I am in no way suggesting that my eyes, ears, or soul would tire of seeing Dean on my television screen, in case anyone from ABC is reading this. When it comes to how many consecutive hours of Dean I could feasibly watch on TV:\n\nExhibit B: Dean said he is not ready to be The Bachelor. I know\u2014I\u2019m already crafting my excuse to call out of work sick tomorrow so I can deal with this news, too. But it\u2019s (reportedly) true. Dean supposedly told The Hollywood Reporter, which sounds like a fake news outlet if I\u2019ve ever heard one, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready yet, at this point in my life.\u201d Dean\u2019s right; he\u2019s got to rack up a good thousand more Instagram followers before he can truly be \u201cready.\u201d However, he did add, \u201cOf course, I would never immediately dismiss any offer, but I\u2019d really have to sit down and really think about it.\u201d I think that\u2019s our cue to create a GoFundMe to come up with the extra cash ABC needs to present Dean with an offer he can\u2019t refuse, right? I\u2019ll set one up just in case.\n\nSo I mean, who really knows what will happen. I think I speak for all of us when I say that if ABC tries to pull some fuckery and Nick Viall us again with some lame-ass dude from three seasons ago, I will personally burn the studio to the ground."}

Check back each week for her latest update on the competition.\n\nI knew that Joe and I had an Argentine Tango, and I was so excited because I\u2019ve had the perfect song I\u2019ve been trying to do for seasons. I really thought \u201cEl Tango Roxanne\u201d was perfect for Halloween night. It\u2019s creepy and intense. I wanted us to be a character, not dead zombies or something. So, I thought Mrs. and Mr. Frankenstein would be awesome and Joe would pull it off.He danced so great; this was by far Joe\u2019s best dance. I was so happy for him, especially since the judges were very complimentary, and he just had an epic performance. I think this was great for his confidence going into the next week for Country Week. We didn\u2019t want to beat around the bush. We did a pure Argentine tango, he remembered the steps and executed them really well.\n\nEveryone\u2019s journey is so different on this show and sometimes it takes people seven weeks to get good, sometimes it takes people one week. I think Joe is realizing he\u2019s doing well and understanding this process.\n\nDuring the last five seconds of the dance, Joe grabbed my hips in a bit of a wrong position. It was correct, but it wasn\u2019t all the way around my waist and I knew that if I flipped over, I was probably going to die. I just was like, it\u2019s Halloween night and I have to take one for the team, so I just went for it. I borderline broke my back, but I feel great. Somehow, we landed it, and I think it just made it more surprising and shocking. Sometimes, mistakes are beautiful perfections. If something goes wrong on live TV and someone\u2019s not used to performing or isn\u2019t a dancer, it\u2019s really hard to come back from that. So the fact that he kept going and was still in character and then ripped my head off at the end, I was like, \u2018What? Who is this guy? Not Joe week one! He\u2019s a dancer!\u2019\n\nNext week is Country Week. I didn\u2019t grow up with country music, but I appreciate the lyrics. Usually it\u2019s love songs or some beautiful storytelling. I think it\u2019ll be great for the show because Dancing With the Stars is all about storytelling. We\u2019ve never done a country week before, so it\u2019ll be a first for all of us. Joe and I have something fun planned. I\u2019m gonna go for Coachella vibes \u2026 or should I stay Stagecoach vibes?\n\nDancing With the Stars airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nFor the latest TV news and interviews, subscribe to our new podcast \u201cWatch With Us\u201d below!\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!"}

{"label": true, "txt": "Emma Roberts Bio, Age, Movie, Net worth\n\n\n\n\n\nEmma Rose Roberts (born February 10, 1991) is an American actress, model and singer. She rose to prominence with her role as Addie Singer in the Nickelodeon television series Unfabulous. She subsequently released her debut album, which also served as the show's soundtrack, Unfabulous and More. After Unfabulous ended, Roberts shifted focus to roles in films, first starring in the film Aquamarine and later as the title character in the 2007 film Nancy Drew. Looking for more mature roles, Roberts appeared in the 2009 drama Lymelife and went on to several more films, often in leading roles. She was part of the acting ensemble with her aunt Julia Roberts in the 2010 film Valentine's Day. In her 2013 return to television, she took on the role of Madison Montgomery in American Horror Story: Coven, the third season of the American Horror Story series.\n\n\n\n\n\nEarly life\n\n\n\n\n\nRoberts was born in Rhinebeck, New York.She is the daughter of actor Eric Roberts and Kelly Cunningham, the stepdaughter of Eliza Roberts and Kelly Nickels, and the niece of actresses Julia Roberts and Lisa Roberts Gillan. She also has a half sister, Grace. During her childhood, Roberts spent time on the sets of her aunt Julia Roberts' films. These experiences sparked a desire in Emma, from the age of five, to follow her father and aunts into the film industry. Her mother initially wanted her to have a normal childhood.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmma Roberts Upcoming Movie, TV show\n\n\n\n\n\nActing career\n\n2001\u201305: Early career\n\n\n\n\n\nRoberts made her acting debut at age nine in Ted Demme's 2001 drama Blow. It was the first film for which she ever auditioned. In the film, she portrayed Kristina Jung, the daughter of Johnny Depp's character (cocaine smuggler George Jung). That year, she also had a role in Leif Tilden's 10-minute short bigLove, and was an uncredited extra in some scenes featuring her aunt Julia Roberts in America's Sweethearts.\n\n\n\n\n\nShe went on to appear in smaller roles in two family films: in 2002's Grand Champion, as the sister of the main character Buddy (Jacob Fisher); and in 2003's Spymate, as the kidnapped daughter of former secret agent Mike Muggins (Chris Potter), who tries to rescue her with the help of a spy monkey. Grand Champion had a brief theatrical release in August 2004, while Spymate was not released until February 2006, when it was given a theatrical run in Canada, followed by its DVD release in April 2006. In August 2003, Roberts was scheduled to shoot an independent film called Daisy Winters, starring as the title character, alongside Rachel Weisz. However, the film, which would have been Roberts's first leading role, never began shooting due to financial problems.\n\n\n\n\n\n2006\u201312: Theatrical films\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2006, Roberts returned to the big screen, starring alongside Sara Paxton and singer JoJo in Aquamarine. She won a 2007 Young Artist Award for Best Supporting Young Actress in a Feature Film for her role in the film.The film Aquamarine took 5th place at the box office on its opening weekend making $8 million. In early 2006, Roberts finished shooting her title role in Nancy Drew. The film was released to theaters on June 15, 2007, and grossed over $7 million in its opening weekend,though the film was not well received by critics. Roberts was set to reunite with Nancy Drew director Andrew Fleming on both Rodeo Gal and a Nancy Drew sequel in 2007, but these films were never made. In 2008, she had her voiceover debut when she voiced the English version of the character Wilma in the CGI-animated family film The Flight Before Christmas.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2009, Roberts starred alongside Jake T. Austin in Hotel for Dogs, based on the novel by Lois Duncan. The film premiered in January 2009, and took fifth place in its opening weekend with over $17 million. The film has to-date grossed over $114 million, and received generally mixed reviews from critics.Roberts starred as the lead in the film Wild Child, about a rebellious teen from Malibu, California sent to a boarding school in England. Roberts described her character as \"pretty much your typical spoiled-brat Malibu socialite who gets shipped off to British boarding school.\"Roberts also appeared in the indie film Lymelife with Alec Baldwin, which was premiered at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival. Roberts said that Lymelife is \u201ckind of like American Beauty meets The Ice Storm\u201d, and that her reasoning for doing the film was that, \"Some people look at me and think, She's just Julia Roberts's niece. So I wanted to do something smaller and edgier, something that would show I really am an actress.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nMusic career\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2005, Roberts had a debut album titled Unfabulous and More. The album was released on September 27, 2005, through Columbia Records and Nick Records. It also served as the soundtrack to the television series, Unfabulous, in which Roberts stars. The album peaked at No. 46 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart. In September 2005, two promotional singles were released from the album\u2014\"I Wanna Be\" and \"Dummy.\" The album includes several original songs (among them \"Dummy\" and \"I Wanna Be,\" both of which were also released as music videos, \"I Have Arrived\" and \"This Is Me,\" which was co-written by Roberts), as well as some of Addie's songs from the first season, including \"Punch Rocker\" and \"New Shoes\" (both from the episode \"The Party\"), \"94 Weeks (Metal Mouth Freak)\" (from \"The Bar Mitzvah\") and \"Mexican Wrestler\" (which had previously appeared on Jill Sobule's 2000 album Pink Pearl and in the episode \"The 66th Day\" from Unfabulous). During the same year, Roberts recorded \"If I Had It My Way\" for the soundtrack of the 2005 Disney film Ice Princess. In 2006, Roberts covered the song \"Island in the Sun\", which was originally recorded by Weezer in 2001; she recorded the song for the Aquamarine's soundtrack, a film where she starred as one of the leads.\n\n\n\n\n\nSpokesmodel\n\n\n\n\n\nIn February 2009, she was named the brand ambassador for Neutrogena, appearing in print and television ads for the company.Roberts has also appeared multiple times as part of Teen Vogue\u2019s Best Dressed list, including June 2007, September 2008, December 2008 and February 2009.\n\nPersonal life\n\n\n\n\n\nIn September 2011, Roberts began attending Sarah Lawrence College but by January 2012, Roberts left school to concentrate on work commitments.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmma Roberts News, Gossip, Relationship history\n\n\n\n\n\nRoberts began dating actor Evan Peters in mid-2012. Roberts was arrested for domestic violence against Peters in Montreal, Quebec in July 2013. Someone at the couple's hotel overheard a dispute coming from their room and called police, who arrived to find Peters with a bloody nose and several bite marks.Roberts was released several hours after her arrest when Peters declined to press charges.In a joint statement, Roberts and Peters called it \"an unfortunate incident and misunderstanding,\" and stated that they \"are working together to move past it.\"Media reports on January 6, 2014 said they had become engaged over the holidays.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmma Roberts Dating Timeline; Pictures of Boyfriend\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHot HD Emma Roberts Wallpapers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

They want to know all the ins and outs of her daily life from what she cooks for breakfast to which club she is celebrating her birthday at or any photos of her baby, Stormi. Since her audience is glued to every Snapchat Story or Instagram Post, she uses this to her advantage and creates content specifically about her new collections. For every three to four photos on her Instagram that highlight her personal life, she then includes a product shot which also receives a magnitude of likes and comments. On Snapchat, she shows her followers all the behind-the-scenes aspects of producing KylieCosmetics with trips to her factory, telling her fans when an upcoming collection launches and promoting her flash sales with selfies.\n\nTip: Integrate fun, authentic content that intrigues your community, alongside products that increase sales. Take your followers throughout your daily life so that they connect with you, and they\u2019ll want to purchase your products. Think strategically about your content and how many posts you create that are personal in nature and how many are sales driven.\n\nIgnore The Haters\n\nWith trolls commenting on her social content, Kylie shows that you have to move beyond negative press and focus on your vision and dream. With $630 million in sales since launching in 2016, the data and numbers can silence the haters. In ignoring the negative, she can focus on providing the community that adores her with exclusive access at her pop-up shops and appearances, and she creates a special bond with fans as she replies and reposts their content across social media channels.\n\nTip: Every entrepreneurial pursuit will have obstacles, but continue to believe in your business and address any valid concerns. Listen to feedback from the community to better your product and content, but remember to reward your community that wants you to succeed with special offers and experiences. Overall, it is better to continue to post content than to let negativity deter you from your passions.\n\nPartner With Influencers\n\nKylie already has a built-in network of influencers, but she maximizes reach through partner collections with her Mom, Kris and sisters, Kim, Khloe, and Kourtney. With each partnership launch, there is a large-scale digital campaign with YouTube videos and social media posts -- as each Kardashian has millions of followers. Beyond her family, she also taps into beauty influencers like MakeupShayla and Nicol Concilio to provide outside credibility for the makeup line through their own Instagram posts and YouTube tutorials where they share their thoughts on the makeup.\n\nTip: Find influencers within your niche that have reach beyond your community that can provide validation through social media content for your product or services. You can find influencers in a variety of ways. These include: working with influencer agencies, utilizing influencer apps that connect brands and influencers, search hashtags to find relevant influencers within your industry and then reach out by email or direct message on social channels to start a relationship.\n\nUse Content To Educate\n\nWhether it\u2019s a Snapchat Story or YouTube Tutorial, Kylie uses social media video to educate her community. She showcases her collections by swatching her arm with the various highlighters or eyeshadows and with makeup video guides on YouTube. By breaking down the makeup in a simplified manner, her followers can learn and follow along to create a similar look. Her makeup tutorial videos on YouTube have millions of views, showing that her community is interested in learning how to recreate her looks and finding new makeup tricks.\n\nTip: Utilize social media video to teach your community how to use your products best. This can be through YouTube tutorials or the newly launched, IGTV. Use long-form video to help your followers learn more about your product or services in a way that is digestible and entertaining.\n\nLessons Into Action\n\nBy understanding how Kylie has been able to take her brand to the next level through producing continuous content across multiple social media platforms that educate and excites her community, you can mirror her execution to scale your business. These five lessons in content and community can help lead to increased brand affinity and sales, and in doing so, social media becomes a marketing channel that delivers incredible results."}

Rumors about trouble in David and Victoria\u2019s marriage have been proliferating in the tabloids since the Royal Wedding, where the couple was photographed looking dour. Of course, there are always rumors about the Beckhams, who will (hopefully?) celebrate their 19th wedding anniversary on July 4. This time, though, social-media participants seem convinced that they are really heading for a split.\n\nThere are a few factors to consider when weighing the possibility of divorce. One is: Do you care? Another is: What have the Beckhams said about their marriage? (It\u2019s F-I-N-E, according to their publicist, who called the rumors \u201cJournalist Chinese whispers and fake news fueled by social media.\u201d) And another is: What\u2019s going on with the Beckhams\u2019 businesses?\n\nLast week, the Daily Mail reported that David left his longtime manager, who also manages Posh, for a new team led by his friend David Gardner. This, to me, would be the strongest sign of an impending split, but the Beckhams quickly denied the report. Then, Victoria gave a speech at the Forbes Women Summit in New York, where she mentioned David specifically and called him an \u201cincredible husband.\u201d\n\n\u201cI try really, really hard. I try hardest to be the best mother,\u201d she said in her speech, according to People. \u201cI am trying to be the best wife and the best professional. When I get home I try to put the phone down and spend time with the children and spend time with David. I have the support of an incredible husband. We really are equal with everything we do at home with the children. When I\u2019m away he\u2019s the one doing the school run and doing the cooking.\u201d\n\nSo Victoria is trying. Is David? So far, he hasn\u2019t personally said anything about the divorce rumors. I\u2019d wait to see what he does next week for their anniversary.\n\nIn other celebrity relationship news, Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus are doing great. Shookus\u2019s parents visited the couple in L.A. this past weekend, and they all went on a dinner date and a hike the next day. (Shookus\u2019s 5-year-old daughter was present for the hike, too.) According to an \u201ceyewitness\u201d who talked to People, Affleck was in a \u201cgreat mood\u201d at dinner, and he \u201cpicked up the check at the end of the night.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Juliano-rol/X17online.com\n\nBut Affleck and Shookus are not necessarily getting more serious, according to Entertainment Tonight. A source close to Affleck told the outlet, \u201cBen knows he loves Lindsay, but he wants to take things slow for the sake of his sobriety. He\u2019s actually been told to take it slow and he\u2019s heeding that advice \u2026 Ben isn\u2019t ready to propose and has no plans to get engaged anytime soon, but Lindsay feels he is worth the wait.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think? Is Ben Affleck worth the wait?\n\nMoving more quickly is Shookus\u2019s SNL colleague Pete Davidson, who just moved into a $16 million apartment in Manhattan with his new fianc\u00e9, Ariana Grande. Grande\u2019s 25th birthday is today, and Davidson wished her a happy birthday on Instagram just after midnight.\n\nLast night, Grande posted a photo of Davidson on her Instagram story at 11:11 p.m. with the caption, \u201ci have no wish i have everything i ever wanted hi.\u201d I love it!\n\nDo you remember who Chris Martin is dating? It\u2019s Dakota Johnson. They were photographed walking a dog in Malibu on Sunday.\n\nPhoto: DOBN/RMBI/BACKGRID\n\nOne small blessing from this week:\n\nMartin\u2019s ex-wife, Gwyneth Paltrow, is preparing to marry her fianc\u00e9, the television producer Brad Falchuk at the end of the summer. Here\u2019s what she had to say about wedding planning this time around:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very busy so I\u2019m actually not that involved in it.\u201d\n\nPhoto: XPOS/BACKGRID\n\nAnd here\u2019s an interesting blind item from this week, from Enty at Crazy Days and Nights:\n\n\u201cThis former A- list mostly television actress from a now defunct hit comedy is probably A-/B+ list mostly movie actress. She says that this A-/B+ list writer/actor all of you know spent three weeks chatting her up and doing everything he could to hook up with her. She finally hooked up with him and within 30 minutes after, he had her out the door and has ghosted her since.\u201d\n\nI believe that \u201cA-/B+ list writer/actor all of you know\u201d has moved on with an even younger actress.\n\nFinally, I\u2019ll leave you with some incredible news: Emma Watson is back together with former Glee star Chord Overstreet. Or perhaps they never broke up? They first announced their relationship back in March, with a very obvious pap stroll in L.A.. Then, People reported at the end of May that they were over. But last week, they were pap-strolling in L.A. again, and this time, they made out for the camera! Watson must really like this guy to go along with all of this.\n\nThanks so much for gossiping this week. Don\u2019t forget to email me at allie.jones@nymag.com, send me a message on Twitter, or contact me on Signal, if you\u2019d like to chat."}
{"label": true, "txt": "Ellen Page just added her name to the list of women with damning things to say about Brett Ratner, the powerful producer and director who was accused of sexual misconduct by numerous women in early November\u2014including Olivia Munn. On Friday, Page told a few Ratner stories of her own in a lengthy Facebook post, detailing Ratner\u2019s alleged inappropriate behavior toward her.\n\nWhen she was 18 years old, the actress says that Ratner made a lewd joke about her sexuality during a cast and crew \u201cmeet and greet\u201d on the set of X-Men: The Last Stand. (Page played the character Kitty Pryde in the film.)\n\n\u201cYou should f--k her to make her realize she\u2019s gay,\u201d Ratner allegedly said to another woman in the group, Page writes. Page, who came out as a lesbian in 2014, says she felt \u201cviolated\u201d by his alleged remark. \u201cHe \u2018outed\u2019 me with no regard for my well-being, an act we all recognize as homophobic.\u201d\n\nShe continues: \u201cI proceeded to watch him on set say degrading things to women. I remember a woman walking by the monitor as he made a comment about her \u2018flappy pussy.\u2019\u201d\n\nActress Anna Paquin, who co-starred in the film, tweeted that she supported Page\u2019s claims. \u201cI was there when that comment was made. I stand with you,\u201d she wrote.\n\nRepresentatives for Ratner have not yet responded to Vanity Fair\u2019s request for comment about these claims.\n\nPage\u2019s Facebook post, however, is about much more than Ratner alone. The actress also discusses sexual abuse in the industry at large, sharing a story about a director who allegedly propositioned her during a dinner meeting when she was just 16 years old.\n\n\u201cHe fondled my leg under the table and said, \u2018You have to make the move, I can\u2019t.\u2019 I did not make the move and I was fortunate to get away from that situation,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt was a painful realization: my safety was not guaranteed at work.\u201d\n\nPage says she \u201cwas sexually assaulted by a grip months later. I was asked by a director to sleep with a man in his late twenties and to tell them about it. I did not. This is just what happened during my sixteenth year, a teenager in the entertainment industry.\u201d\n\nPage also points to other stars who have been accused of sexual abuse in the past, including Bill Cosby, Roman Polanski, and Harvey Weinstein. She then turns to Woody Allen, whom she worked with on the 2012 film To Rome with Love.\n\n\u201cI did a Woody Allen movie and it is the biggest regret of my career,\u201d she writes. \u201cI am ashamed I did this. I had yet to find my voice and was not who I am now and felt pressured, because \u2018of course you have to say yes to this Woody Allen film.\u2019 Ultimately, however, it is my choice what films I decide to do and I made the wrong choice. I made an awful mistake.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Allen\u2019s estranged daughter, Dylan Farrow, accused him of sexually abusing her when she was a child in an essay for The New York Times. He responded with an essay of his own, denying the allegations. The allegations that he sexually abused Farrow first surfaced publicly back in 1992. Allen has never been charged for these claims.\n\nPage also notes in her post that as a wealthy cis white woman, she has certain \u201cprivileges\u201d over women of other backgrounds when it comes to protecting herself. She wraps her post with a rallying cry for the people learning more about sexual abuse in the industry: \u201cDon\u2019t allow yourselves to be numb to the voices of victims coming forward. Don\u2019t stop demanding our civil rights. I am grateful to anyone and everyone who speaks out against abuse and trauma they have suffered. You are breaking the silence. You are revolution.\u201d\n\nGet Vanity Fair\u2019s HWD Newsletter Sign up for essential industry and award news from Hollywood. E-mail Address Subscribe"}

She is the co-host, with Hoda Kotb, of the fourth hour of NBC's Today. She is best known for her 15-year run (1985\u20132000) on the talk show Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee, which she co-hosted with Regis Philbin. She has received 11 Daytime Emmy nominations and won her first Daytime Emmy in 2010 as part of the Today team. Gifford's first television role had been as Tom Kennedy's singer/sidekick on the syndicated version of Name That Tune, from 1974 to 1978. She also occasionally appears on the first three hours of Today and is a contributing NBC News correspondent.\n\nKathie Lee married Paul Johnson, a Christian composer/arranger/producer/publisher in 1976. After their divorce in 1982, she married sportscaster and former NFL player Frank Gifford in 1986. He died in 2015. Kathie Lee has released studio albums and written books.\n\nEarly life and beginnings [ edit ]\n\nGifford was born Kathryn Lee Epstein in Paris, France, to American parents, Joan (born Cuttell; January 20, 1930 \u2013 September 12, 2017), a singer, and Aaron Epstein (March 19, 1924 \u2013 November 19, 2002), a musician and former US Navy Chief Petty Officer. Aaron Epstein was stationed with his family in France at the time of Gifford's birth.[2] Gifford grew up in Bowie, Maryland, and attended Bowie High School.[3]\n\nGifford's paternal grandfather was a Russian Jewish man from Saint Petersburg and her paternal grandmother was of Native American ancestry. Her mother, a relative of writer Rudyard Kipling, was of French-Canadian, English and German descent.[4][5]\n\nAfter seeing the Billy Graham\u2013produced film The Restless Ones at age 12, Gifford became a born-again Christian. She told interviewer Larry King, \"I was raised with many Jewish traditions and raised to be very grateful for my Jewish heritage.\"[6]\n\nDuring high school, Gifford was a singer in a folk group, \"Pennsylvania Next Right\", which performed frequently at school assemblies. After high school graduation in 1971, Gifford attended Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma, studying drama and music. During a summer in the early 1970s, she was a live-in secretary/babysitter for Anita Bryant at her home in Miami.\n\nLive! with Regis and Kathie Lee [ edit ]\n\nFollowing her divorce from her first husband Paul Johnson in 1983, Gifford met sports commentator Frank Gifford during an episode of ABC's Good Morning America; they were married from 1986 until his death in 2015. At the time she was several months into her role as a full-time morning talk show personality.\n\nOn June 24, 1985, she replaced Ann Abernathy as co-host of The Morning Show on WABC-TV with Regis Philbin. The program went into national broadcast in 1988 as Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee, and Gifford became well-known across the country. Throughout the 1990s, morning-TV viewers watched her descriptions of life at home with Frank, her sportscaster husband and son Cody and daughter Cassidy. Gifford left the show on July 28, 2000.\n\nRegis Philbin and Kathie Lee were jointly nominated eight consecutive years in a row (1993 to 2000) for Outstanding Talk Show Host during the Daytime Emmy Awards.[7]\n\nCurrent career [ edit ]\n\nIn September 2005 she became a special correspondent on The Insider, a syndicated entertainment magazine television show, ending her relationship with that program upon her co-hosting role with Today.[8]\n\nOn March 31, 2008, NBC announced that Gifford was to join its morning show, Today, as co-host of the fourth hour, alongside Hoda Kotb. This marked her return to morning television; in many markets, she now airs directly after her old show, currently called Live with Kelly and Ryan. Because the fourth hour of Today airs live at 10:00 am ET, and Live with Kelly and Ryan airs live at 9:00 am ET, Gifford's hour does not compete directly with her former show in most markets.[9] Kotb and Gifford replaced Ann Curry and Natalie Morales. In the weeks prior to Gifford's arrival, ratings indicated 1.9 million viewers of the fourth hour of Today.[10] As of 2014, the fourth hour of Today with Gifford and Kotb has averaged 2.15 million total viewers, an increase of 13 percent over the 2008 ratings.[11][12] On December 11, 2018, it was announced that she will be leaving Today in April 2019.[13]\n\nMedia appearances and projects [ edit ]\n\nGifford's career took off in the 1970s as a vocalist on the game show Name That Tune with Tom Kennedy. In 1978, she joined the cast of the short-lived Hee Haw spinoff, Hee Haw Honeys.\n\nGifford has made guest appearances in films and television series, and has several independently released albums on CD, including 2000's The Heart of a Woman, featuring the single \"Love Never Fails\".[14][15]\n\nShe appeared as a spokesperson for Slim Fast diet shakes after her son Cody was born. She also was the face of Carnival Cruise Lines in the late 1980s and early 1990s, singing \"If my friends could see me now!\" In 1994, she appeared as herself in an episode of the NBC sitcom Seinfeld.\n\nShe did a number of voice overs most notably as Echidna in the 1998 TV series Hercules and the follow up 1999 comedy-drama and animated television film Hercules: Zero to Hero.\n\nShe played the role of Miss Hannigan in a concert performance of Annie at Madison Square Garden in December 2006.[16]\n\nOn an episode that aired March 27, 2010, she guest starred on The Suite Life on Deck, along with her real-life daughter, Cassidy.\n\nShe appeared as herself in the 2015 television film Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!\n\nShe has written two autobiographical books, Just When I Thought I'd Dropped my Last Egg: Life and Other Calamities in 2010 and The Rock, the Road and the Rabbi to be released in early 2018. She has also written a number of children's books.\n\nMusical theatre [ edit ]\n\nIn the late 1990s, Gifford began working in musical theatre. She contributed a number of musical numbers to Hats, and wrote and produced Under The Bridge,[17] based upon the children's book The Family Under The Bridge by Natalie Savage Carlson. In 2000 she released the album The Heart of a Woman on Universal.\n\nIn 2007, she premiered Saving Aimee, a stage musical about evangelist Aimee McPherson, at the Signature Theatre in Arlington, Virginia.[18][19] The premiere starred actress Carolee Carmello in the lead role.[20] The show, now titled Scandalous: The Life and Trials of Aimee Semple McPherson, ran on Broadway from November 15, 2012, through December 9, 2012,[21] with Carmello reprising her role as McPherson. On April 30, 2013, Carmello received her third Tony Award nomination for the performance.[22]\n\nOn April 16, 2007, Gifford was a guest presenter at the Washington, D.C. Helen Hayes Award Ceremony, honoring contributions and professional accomplishments in theatre.[23]\n\nIn 2008, Gifford and David Friedman wrote a junior high school musical entitled Key Pin It Real.[24] The play depicts a coming-of-age story about a young girl named Key Pin. The first production took place in December 2008 in Kendallville, Indiana, at East Noble High School.[25]\n\nGifford is currently working on a musical adaptation of It's a Wonderful Life with John McDaniel; McDaniel is composing music while Gifford is writing lyrics.[26]\n\nCharity [ edit ]\n\nGifford is a celebrity ambassador for the non-profit organization Childhelp. She regularly makes appearances at fund raisers and events for the child abuse prevention and treatment organization and is an ardent supporter.[27]\n\nFrank and Kathie Lee Gifford raised the money to build and continued to financially support two shelters in New York City for babies born with HIV, or a congenital crack cocaine addiction. These shelters were named in honor of her children, Cody and Cassidy.[28] Frank and Kathie Lee also shared a birthday, August 16.\n\nLabor rights activity [ edit ]\n\nIn 1996 the National Labor Committee, a human rights group, reported that sweatshop labor was being used to make clothes for the Kathie Lee line, sold at Wal-Mart.[29] The group reported that a worker in Honduras smuggled a piece of clothing out of the factory, which had a Kathie Lee label on it.[30] One of the workers, Wendy Diaz, came to the United States to testify about the conditions under which she worked. She commented, \"I wish I could talk to [Kathie Lee]. If she's good, she will help us.\"[31]\n\nLabor activist Charles Kernaghan spoke to the media and accused Gifford of being responsible for the sweatshop management activity. Gifford addressed Kernaghan's allegations on the air during Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee, explaining that she was not involved with hands-on project management in factories.[32]\n\nGifford later contacted federal authorities to investigate the issue and worked with US federal legislative and executive branch agencies to support and enact laws to protect children against sweatshop conditions. She appeared with President Bill Clinton at the White House in support of the government's initiatives to counter international sweatshop abuses.[33]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nKathie Lee married Paul Johnson, a Christian composer/arranger/producer/publisher in 1976. They gained fame in Christian music, appearing on covers of Christian magazines. But the marriage was strenuous from the start and in 1981, Johnson moved out. The couple divorced in 1982.[34]\n\nOn October 18, 1986, Kathie Lee married a second time, this time to Frank Gifford, an American football player and television sports commentator. It was his third marriage after marriages with Maxine Avis Ewart and Astrid Lindley. With Ewart he had three children.\n\nKathie Lee was 23 years younger than Frank when they got married. They had two children together, Cody Newton Gifford (born March 22, 1990) and Cassidy Erin Gifford (born August 2, 1993). Frank died on August 9, 2015, from natural causes at their Greenwich, Connecticut, home, a week shy of his 85th birthday.[35][36] In 2017, she released \"He Saw Jesus\", a very personal song Kathie Lee co-wrote (with songwriter Brett James) and dedicated to her husband. All proceeds from the song went to the international evangelical Christian humanitarian aid charity Samaritan's Purse.\n\nDiscography [ edit ]\n\nAlbums [ edit ]\n\n(as Kathie Lee Gifford except where indicated)\n\n1992: Sentimental Journey\n\n1993: It's Christmas Time\n\n1993: Christmas Carols\n\n1993: Sentimental\n\n1993: Christmas With Kathie Lee Gifford (double album)\n\n1995: Dreamship: Lullabies for Little Ones\n\n1995: Kathie Lee's Rock 'N' Tots Cafe: A Christmas \"Giff\"\n\n2000: Heart of a Woman (as Kathie Lee)\n\n2000: Born For You (as Kathie Lee)\n\n2001: Goodnight, Angel (as Kathie Lee)\n\n2004: Gentle Grace\n\n2009: Everyone Has a Story (as Kathie Lee Gifford & Friends)\n\n2009: My Way Home\n\n2010: Super Hits\n\nFilmography [ edit ]\n\nFeature films\n\nTelevision series\n\n1978: Days of Our Lives as Nurse Callahan.

We\u2019ll always work with good females.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s true, yes, but we can\u2019t help but feel that will.i.am is just dumping Fergie Ferg into a group of female artists the band has worked with in the past.

{"label": true, "txt": "Just when you thought this season of Vanderpump Rules couldn't get any more scandalous, our favorite SUR squad goes and proves us wrong. This time, the crew was abuzz with rumors that exes Kristen Doute and James Kennedy hooked up during their trip to Mexico.\n\nKristen and James both denied that the alleged hookup took place during Monday night's episode of Vanderpump Rules. And Kristen wasn't backing down from her stance during her appearance on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen Monday, even as one caller questioned why we should believe her this time, considering the fact that she hasn't exactly been honest about hookups in the past. \"Because I'm telling the truth, that's why!\" Kristen responded to the caller on WWHL (clip above). \"Did you see the scene? That's why. He did not say it.\"\n\nKristen is referring to the moment when Tom Sandoval asked James if he had hung out with Kristen the night before their golf outing, to which he replied, \"I mean, a little bit, but not really.\" However, this got misinterpreted as James admitting that he and Kristen hooked up with each other. Kristen said on WWHL that her \"brain exploded\" when she realized that James had never actually said that they hooked up, especially since she became so upset with him, to the point where she threw a drink in his face during one group dinner in Mexico.\n\nWatch What Happens Live Kristen Denies the Rumor Involving James Kennedy After playing a clip of Jax Taylor insinuating a hookup between James Kennedy and Kristen Doute on #PumpRules, Kristen denies the rumor that anything occured between her and her ex-boyfriend.\n\nThough Kristen took out her frustration on several members of the Vanderpump Rules crew during the episode, she said that she was the most angry with Sandoval and Jax Taylor during the whole ordeal. \"Sandoval started it, and Jax really spread the rumor,\" she explained on WWHL.\n\nKristen will have to break the news of the gossip to her boyfriend Brian Carter when she gets back from Mexico in an all-new episode of Vanderpump Rules Monday at 9/8c, which you're not going to want to miss.

{"label": true, "txt": "I'm not a bad guy -- honest.\n\nBut yes, when I downloaded a screen-recording app on my personal smartphone last week, the first thing I thought was, \"Hmm, I wonder if I can save Snapchat videos forever with this thing?\"\n\nIt turns out, I can.\n\nHuffPost\n\nWe can see here a Snapchat video message sent to me by my colleague Alexander Kaufman. (I've transformed it into an animated GIF so that we can relive the memory without sound for the rest of our lives.)\n\nSnapchat wants you to pay to replay messages like this on its platform. Even then, you can only replay messages once, which makes a certain amount of sense -- Snapchat is of the moment, a deliverer of your friends' funny candid thoughts, photos and videos specifically greased down to go in one ear and out the other.\n\nStill, sometimes you get something so good that you want to just save it forever. Here's how you can do that without spending any money.\n\nFirst, download AZ Screen Recorder - No Root from the official Google Play Store. As its name suggests, you don't need to do anything weird to your phone for it to work: Just download the app and you're set.\n\nOpen the app, start recording, then open Snapchat.\n\nHuffPost\n\nAZ Screen Recorder will be recording everything on your screen, so simply open the Snapchat message you want to hold onto forever. When you're done viewing it, drag down from the top of your screen and stop recording.\n\nFrom there, you'll have a shareable video file. Your friends won't know you recorded the footage. You can put it onto your computer, cut it down or do whatever you want with it. (For a $3 in-app purchase, you'll be able to trim your video files within AZ Screen Recorder itself.)\n\nHuffPost\n\nIt might seem a little silly to go through the effort just to record Snapchat videos. And honestly, it's kind of a sketchy thing to do to someone. So, take this as a reminder that you should be pretty darn careful about anything you send on your phone, especially to your pesky Android friends: It's probably a lot less secure or \"private\" than you think.\n\n(Apple has for years disallowed screen recording apps over security concerns, so you can rest a bit easier when it comes to your iPhone-wielding friends.)"}

{"label": true, "txt": "American actress\n\nJada Koren Pinkett Smith (; born September 18, 1971)[1] is an American actress, wife of Will Smith, singer-songwriter, and businesswoman.\n\nShe began her acting career in 1990, with a guest appearance on the short-lived sitcom True Colors, and subsequently starred in the television series A Different World (1991\u20131993). She made her feature film debut in Menace II Society (1993). Her breakthrough came opposite Eddie Murphy in The Nutty Professor (1996), and she has since starred in more than 20 feature films, including Set It Off (1996), Scream 2 (1997), Ali (2001), The Matrix Reloaded (2003), The Matrix Revolutions (2003), the Madagascar films (2005\u20132012), Bad Moms (2016), and Girls Trip (2017). On television, she has starred in Hawthorne (2009\u20132011) and Gotham (2014\u20132016).\n\nPinkett Smith launched her music career in 2002, when she helped create the metal band Wicked Wisdom, for which she is a singer and songwriter. Along with her husband Will Smith, she has a production company, and has had producing credits in films, documentaries, and television series. She also wrote a children's book, Girls Hold Up This World, which was published in 2004.\n\nWith Smith, whom Jada is married since 1997, she has two children, son Jaden and daughter Willow. Through their marriage she is also stepmother to Smith's son from his first marriage, Trey Smith.\n\nFamily and early life [ edit ]\n\nBorn in Baltimore, Maryland, Jada Koren Pinkett was named after her mother's favorite soap-opera actress, Jada Rowland.[1] Pinkett Smith is of Jamaican and Barbadian descent on her mother's side and African American descent on her father's side.[2][3][4] Her parents are Adrienne Banfield-Norris, the head nurse of an inner-city clinic in Baltimore, and Robsol Pinkett, Jr., who ran a construction company. Banfield-Norris became pregnant in high school; the couple married but divorced after several months.[5][6] Banfield-Jones raised Pinkett with the help of her own mother, Marion Martin Banfield, a Boston born daughter of Jamaican immigrants, who was a social worker.[7] Banfield noticed her granddaughter's passion for the performing arts and enrolled her in piano, tap dance, and ballet lessons.[8] She has a younger brother, actor/writer Caleeb Pinkett.\n\nPinkett Smith has remained close to her mother and said, \"A mother and daughter's relationship is usually the most honest, and we are so close.\" She also added: \"[My mother] understood what I wanted and never stood in my way.\"[9] She participated as the maid of honor in Banfield-Norris' 1998 wedding to Paul Jones, a telecommunications executive.[10] Pinkett Smith has shown great admiration for her grandmother, saying, \"My grandmother was a doer who wanted to create a better community and add beauty to the world.\"[11]\n\nPinkett Smith attended the Baltimore School for the Arts, where she met and became close friends with her classmate, rapper Tupac Shakur. When she met Shakur, she was a drug dealer.[12] She majored in dance and theatre and graduated in 1989.[13] She continued her education at the North Carolina School of the Arts, and became fully invested in pursuing her acting career.\n\nShe moved to Los Angeles and stayed with LaVern Whitt, former stuntwoman, now producer and long time family/friend, who got her started in the industry. In Los Angeles, Pinkett Smith inquired about the choreographer position for the television series In Living Color, created by actor Keenen Ivory Wayans, whom she met through Whitt, but the job was already taken by Rosie Perez. Whitt helped Pinkett Smith find an acting agent and got her started in the industry by introducing her to many of her celebrity friends, including Wayans.\n\nActing career [ edit ]\n\nBeginnings (1990\u20131995) [ edit ]\n\nPinkett began her acting career in 1990, when she starred in an episode of True Colors. She appeared in a television pilot for a supernatural drama titled Moe's World but it was never aired. She received guest roles in television shows such as Doogie Howser, M.D. (1991) and 21 Jump Street (1991), and earned a role on comedian Bill Cosby's NBC television sitcom A Different World in 1991, as college freshman Lena James.[5]\n\nIn 1994, Pinkett Smith acted with Keenen Ivory Wayans in the action and comedy film A Low Down Dirty Shame. She described her character, Peaches, as \"raw\" with \"major attitude\",[14] and her acting garnered positive reviews. The New York Times noted, \"Ms. Pinkett, whose performance is as sassy and sizzling as a Salt-n-Pepa recording, walks away with the movie.\"[15] In 1994, she also starred as a title character in Doug McHenry's romantic drama Jason's Lyric (1994), opposite Allen Payne, and in 1995, played a convict on work release in the horror film Demon Knight (1995). Roger Ebert, in his review for the former film, praised the chemistry between Payne and Pinkett Smith, writing: \"[He] has powerful chemistry with the enigmatic, teasing, tender character played by Pinkett; they really seem to like one another, which is not a feeling you always pick up in screen romances\".[16]\n\nRise to prominence (1996\u20132003) [ edit ]\n\nPinkett Smith starred with actor and comedian Eddie Murphy in the 1996 remake of The Nutty Professor, portraying the love interest of a kind-hearted University professor who is morbidly obese. The film was a commercial success, earning US$25 million in its first weekend in North America; it eventually made US$274 million worldwide.[17][18] She also had a role in Set It Off (1996), a crime drama about four women who rob banks to escape from poverty, opposite Queen Latifah, Vivica A. Fox, and Kimberly Elise. Her acting in the film was noted in the San Francisco Chronicle, where they said she was \"the one to watch\".[19] Budgeted at US$9 million, Set It Off made US$41 million globally.[20]\n\nIn 1997, Pinkett Smith had a cameo role in Scream 2 as a college student who is brutally murdered in front of hundreds of cinemagoers. The film made more than US$100 million at the North American box office. In 1998, she played a news reporter in the thriller Return to Paradise, with Joaquin Phoenix and Vince Vaughn, and took on the title role of an extroverted woman, alongside Tommy Davidson, in the comedy Woo. While giving positive reviews to her performance in Woo, Derek Armstrong of AllMovie stated that the script was \"formulaic\" and \"not much of a vehicle for its impish starlet\".[21] She next starred in Spike Lee's film Bamboozled (2000), as a personal assistant to the main character portrayed by Damon Wayans. Although the film met with mediocre reviews, it won the Freedom of Expression Award by the National Board of Review.[22]\n\nPinkett Smith in 2001\n\nIn 2001, Pinkett Smith portrayed a loud mouthed wife in the moderately successful comedy Kingdom Come, with LL Cool J, Vivica A. Fox, Anthony Anderson, Toni Braxton, and Whoopi Goldberg.[23] In the biographical sports drama Ali (also 2001), she played Sonji Roi, the first wife of boxer Muhammad Ali, opposite Will Smith. While she loved the final product, she initially did not think she was the right person for the role: \"I felt like because we were a couple off screen, for people to see us together on the screen in a movie like this, would take people out of the movie, that people would see Will and Jada there \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t see Ali and Sonji\".[24]\n\nPerhaps her best-known role to date is the part of human rebel Niobe in the films The Matrix Reloaded (2003) and The Matrix Revolutions (2003), sequels to 1999's The Matrix, and the related video game Enter The Matrix (2003). The character was written specifically with Pinkett Smith in mind.[25] Directly after she filmed her scenes for Ali, Pinkett Smith flew to Australia to work on the Matrix sequels. The New York Times highlighted the film's \"postmodern purview that accords equal weight to philosophical ideals from people of color\" and noted that \"few actresses have ever been as luminously photographed as Ms. Pinkett Smith\".[26] The sequels earned over US$91 million and US$48 million during their North American opening weekends, respectively.[27][28]\n\nActing, producing, and directing (2004\u20132013) [ edit ]\n\nIn the neo-noir thriller Collateral (2004), alongside Jamie Fox and Tom Cruise, Pinkett Smith obtained the role of a U.S. Justice Department prosecutor and the target of a contract killer. The film was a critical and commercial success, grossing US$217.8 million worldwide.[29] She voiced Gloria, a strong, confident, but sweet hippopotamus, in the computer animated film Madagascar (2005).[30] Tom McGrath, one of the film's directors, stated that they found all these traits in her voice, when they listened to her.[31] Despite the mixed response from critics,[32] the film was a commercial success, earning US$532 million worldwide,[33] making it one of the biggest hits of 2005.[34] In 2007, she played the wife of an affluent dentist in the drama Reign Over Me, with Adam Sandler, Don Cheadle, Liv Tyler, and Donald Sutherland. Entertainment Weekly described the film as a \"strange, black-and-blue therapeutic drama equally mottled with likable good intentions and agitating clumsiness\", and found Pinkett Smith to be \"graceful\" in it.[35]\n\nIn 2008, Pinkett Smith took on the role of a lesbian author in the all-female comedy The Women, opposite Meg Ryan, Annette Bening, Debra Messing, and Eva Mendes.[36] Though a commercial success, The Women was panned by critics, with Pinkett Smith earning a nomination for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress for her performance. Her directorial debut was the drama The Human Contract (also 2008); she also wrote, and starred as the sister of a successful but unhappy businessman, with Paz Vega and Idris Elba. It debuted at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2008.[37] The success of Madagascar led Pinkett Smith to return to the role of Gloria in the 2008 sequel Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, which earned US$603 million at the international box office.[38]\n\nPinkett Smith was an executive producer and starred as a Chief Nursing Officer in the TNT medical drama Hawthorne, which premiered on June 16, 2009.[39] USA Today remarked: \"Pinkett Smith's Hawthorne is tired in every sense of the word, and she's not the only one. Every character and event falls under the category of painfully predictable\".[40] Hawthorne ended on August 16, 2011, after three seasons. While she reprised the voice role of Gloria in Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted (2012), which made over US$746 million,[41] she also voiced the character in the NBC Christmas special Merry Madagascar (2009) and the direct-to-DVD film Madly Madagascar (2013).\n\nCommercial success (2014\u2013present) [ edit ]\n\nBeginning in 2014, Pinket Smith starred in the first season of the FOX crime drama Gotham, as Gotham City gangster Fish Mooney.[42][43] She returned, recurrently, in the second and third seasons of the series. In 2015, she starred in the comedy Magic Mike XXL, as the manager of a star stripper club, opposite Channing Tatum and Joe Manganiello. The film made US$122.5 million worldwide.[44] She starred with Mila Kunis, Kristen Bell and Christina Applegate in the comedy Bad Moms (2016), as the sidekick of a domineering parent-teacher association head.[45] It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the cast and humor, though did not feel it could \"take full advantage of its assets\".[46] The film, nevertheless, earned more than US$183.9 million.[47]\n\nPinkett Smith next took on the role of a nurse and uptight mom in the comedy Girls Trip (2017), alongside Regina Hall, Queen Latifah and Tiffany Haddish. The film was chosen by Time magazine as one of its top ten films of 2017,[48] and grossed US$140 million worldwide, including over US$100 million domestically, the first comedy of 2017 to do so.[49] Beginning in May 2018, Pinkett Smith has hosted the Facebook Watch talk show Red Table Talk, which features her mom and her daughter and focuses on a wide range of topics, with these being being watched from three different perspectives.[50] In a positive review, USA Today's Maeve McDermott praised the series for its \"insightful guests, no-holds-barred topics and Smith\u2019s magnetic hosting presence\".[51]\n\nMusical career [ edit ]\n\nI listened to all kinds of metal as a kid. Metallica Guns N' Roses . I would always look at Axl Rose and say, \"Why aren't there any chicks out there doing this now?\" I always wanted an opportunity to get out there and rock out. \u2014Pinkett Smith on why she created Wicked Wisdom[52]\n\nUnder the stage name Jada Koren, Pinkett Smith formed the metal band Wicked Wisdom in 2002.[52] The band consists of Pinkett Smith performing lead vocals, Pocket Honore (guitar, vocals), Cameron \"Wirm\" Graves (guitar, keyboard, vocals), and Rio (bass, vocals). The band is managed by James Lassiter and Miguel Melendez of Overbrook Entertainment, a company co-founded by Pinkett Smith's husband Will Smith.[53]\n\nThe band's self-titled debut album was released on February 21, 2006, by Pinkett Smith's production company 100% Womon and Suburban Noize Records. Will Smith served as the project's executive producer.[54] The album made it to Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart, and peaked at number 44 during the week of March 11, 2006. AllMusic reviewer Alex Henderson said of the album, \"[Pinkett Smith] shows herself to be an expressive, commanding singer\" and that \"[Wicked Wisdom] shows considerable promise\".[55] The band promoted the album in 2006, touring with heavy metal band Sevendust.[56]\n\nOnyx Hotel Tour [ edit ]\n\nWicked Wisdom landed a slot on Britney Spears' Onyx Hotel Tour in 2004, one of the year's highest-profile tours. The band opened for Spears for eight dates in April and May 2004, during the European leg of the tour.[57]\n\nOzzfest 2005 [ edit ]\n\nIn 2005, Sharon Osbourne went to see Wicked Wisdom perform at a small nightclub in Los Angeles. She said, \"I was blown away. When you see and hear Jada with her band it's apparent that she has nothing but love and respect for this genre of music\".[53] In May 2005 organizers announced Wicked Wisdom would perform on the second stage of 2005's Ozzfest.[58] Fans of the festival were outraged, claiming the band did not have the credibility to perform at the music festival. Aware of the questions about the band's addition to Ozzfest, Pinkett Smith said, \"I'm not here asking for any favors. You've got to show and prove. And not every audience is going to go for it.\"[59] Wicked Wisdom's guitarist Pocket Honore said while early dates of the tour were rocky, \"once word got out that we weren't a joke, people started coming out and by the sixth or seventh gig we were on fire\".[52] Pinkett Smith agreed, saying, \"After seven dates within the Ozzfest tour, the whole attitude of it started to turn around once the word of mouth started getting out.\"[56]\n\nOther ventures [ edit ]\n\nBusiness [ edit ]\n\nAfter opening her music company 100% Womon Productions,[39] Pinkett Smith created her own fashion label, Maja, in 1994. The clothing line features women's T-shirts and dresses embellished with the slogan \"Sister Power\", sold primarily through small catalogs.[8]\n\nIn 2003, Pinkett Smith and Smith helped to create the television series All of Us, which aired on UPN/The CW. Pinkett Smith published her first children's book, Girls Hold Up This World, in 2004. \"I wrote the book for Willow and for her friends and for all the little girls in the world who need affirmation about being female in this pretty much masculine world. I really tried to capture different sides of femininity. I want girls in the world to feel powerful, to know they have the power to change the world in any way they wish.\"[60]\n\nIn 2005, Pinkett Smith became one of many celebrities to invest a combined total of US$10 million in Carol's Daughter, a line of beauty products created by Lisa Price.[61] She became a spokesperson for the beauty line, and said, \"To be a part of another African American woman's dream was just priceless to me.\"[62]\n\nShe also is a shareholder of the Philadelphia 76ers with her husband Will Smith and other partners.\n\nPhilanthropy [ edit ]\n\nTogether with Will, Pinkett Smith has created the Will and Jada Smith Family Foundation in Baltimore, Maryland, a charity which focuses on youth in urban inner cities and family support. Her aunt, Karen Banfield Evans, is the foundation's executive director. The charity was awarded the David Angell Humanitarian Award by The American Screenwriters Association (ASA) in 2006. The Will and Jada Smith Family Foundation has provided grants to non-profit organizations such as YouthBuild,[63] and Pinkett Smith has made personal donations to organizations such as Capital K-9s.[64]\n\nIn December 2006, she donated US$1 million to the Baltimore School for the Arts in memory of her friend Tupac Shakur.\n\nWhen Pinkett Smith's aunt, Karen Banfield Evans, was diagnosed with lupus,[65] the Will and Jada Smith Family Foundation, in association with the Lupus Foundation of America and Maybelline, held the first annual \"Butterflies Over Hollywood\" event on September 29, 2007, at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles. The event raised funds for LFA public and professional educational programs.[66] The Will and Jada Smith Family Foundation was presented with an award in 2007 at the 4th Annual Lupus Foundation of America Awards.[67]\n\nIn 2012, on behalf of PETA, Pinkett Smith wrote a letter to Baltimore's mayor, asking that the visiting Ringling Brothers Circus \"comply with Baltimore\u2019s absolute prohibition of the use of devices such as bullhooks\" and not harm the elephants.[68] In 2013, she appeared in a video clip for Gucci's \"Chime for Change\" campaign that aims to raise funds and awareness of women's issues globally.[69]\n\nIn 1997, Pinkett Smith was the emcee of the Million Woman March in Philadelphia.[70][71][72]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nFamily [ edit ]\n\nPinkett Smith with her husband and children at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize Concert\n\nJada met Will Smith in 1994 on the set of Smith's television show The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, when she auditioned for the role of his character's girlfriend, Lisa Wilkes. She was considered too short and the role went to actress Nia Long. Jada and Will became friends, and began dating in 1995. On December 31, 1997, about 100 guests attended their wedding at The Cloisters, near her hometown of Baltimore, Maryland.[73] Regarding her marriage, Jada said that they are \"private people\"[74] and told one interviewer, \u201cI will throw my career away before I let it break up our marriage. I made it clear to Will. I'd throw it away completely.\u201d[75]\n\nJada and Will have two children, Jaden (b. 1998),[73][76] and Willow (b. 2000). She is also the stepmother of Trey Smith, Will's son from a previous marriage.[7][73]\n\nWill commented in 2008 on their parenting styles: \"We're not strict but we definitely believe it's a very important component for rearing children. It creates safety for them. They understand that they need guidance.\"[77] Jaden and Willow are currently being homeschooled.[11] The family resides in a 27,000 square foot (2,500 m2) home, on 100 acres (40 ha), in Malibu.[9]\n\nScientology [ edit ]\n\nAfter meeting Tom Cruise during the filming of Collateral in 2004, Pinkett Smith and Smith donated US$20,000 to the Hollywood Education and Literacy Program (HELP), Scientology's basis for homeschooling.[78] The couple came under fire in 2008 when they decided to fund the now-defunct New Village Leadership Academy, a private elementary school located in Calabasas, California. The school employed teachers dedicated to Scientology and featured controversial methodologies like Study Technology, created by Church of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. The couple have denied claims that they are themselves Scientologists, although in 2017 actress and former Scientologist Leah Remini has stated that Pinkett Smith is a member of the Church. In October 2018, Leah Remini and Jada Smith cleared their differences on the Red Table Talk Show.[79]\n\nFilmography [ edit ]\n\nVideo games Year Title Role Notes 2003 Enter the Matrix Niobe Live-action cutscenes and voice\n\nAwards and nominations [ edit ]"}

{"label": true, "txt": "We can\u2019t imagine living in a world that Queen Elizabeth II isn\u2019t a part of. She may be 92 years old, but she seems more lively and upbeat than ever \u2014 and we\u2019re sure she\u2019s loving the recent royal marriages as well as the arrival of new little members of the family. While she may still be participating in royal engagements, there\u2019s no doubt that many worry about the old age of her and her husband, Prince Philip. And many wonder what may happen if Prince Philip, who\u2019s currently 97, outlives his beloved wife.\n\n\u2018London Bridge Is Down\u2019 is code for when the queen dies\n\nQueen Elizabeth II attends the 2018 Braemar Highland Gathering in 2018. | Jeff J. Mitchell/ Getty Images Queen Elizabeth II attends the 2018 Braemar Highland Gathering in 2018. | Jeff J. Mitchell/ Getty Images\n\nShe\u2019s held the title of queen for 65 years, Marie Claire notes \u2014 but the country still has to be prepared when she eventually passes. \u201cLondon Bridge Is Down\u201d is code for the queen\u2019s death, and it will first be uttered by the queen\u2019s private secretary over a secure phone line to the prime minister. From there, 15 governments outside the U.K. where Queen Elizabeth is the head of state as well as 36 other Commonwealth nations will be alerted far before the media catches wind.\n\nWhile it\u2019s widely reported that the BBC will be the first to break the news when Philip dies, the Press Association news agency and other global news will be told about the queen\u2019s death at once. This plan, as well as the rest of the protocol, has been laid out since the \u201960s and is carefully revised each year. And reporters at the BBC have even said they\u2019re so prepared for this day that they\u2019ve been rehearsing what they\u2019ll say when the queen dies for over 30 years.\n\nPhilip will not receive a \u2018King Father\u2019 title\n\nQueen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip | Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip | Ben Stansall/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn a scenario where Queen Elizabeth II dies before Philip, there\u2019s been wide speculation about what this will mean for his title. In reality, Philip\u2019s title wouldn\u2019t change. Associate professor Rob Cover told Quora that while Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s mother was known as \u201cQueen Mother\u201d to the public, Philip would not get a \u201cKing Father\u201d title if his wife was to die. And, in reality, Queen Mother isn\u2019t even an official royal title.\n\nThe reason Queen Elizabeth was given the Queen Mother title in the first place was to avoid confusion after her husband died. When Queen Elizabeth II took the throne after her father\u2019s death, the original Queen Elizabeth was then known as Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. Since Philip doesn\u2019t interfere at all with the line of succession, there\u2019s no need for him to change titles if he were to be widowed.\n\nIt\u2019s up to Prince Charles to decide what happens next\n\nPrince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles | Tim Rooke \u2013 WPA Pool/Getty Images Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles | Tim Rooke \u2013 WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nAfter Queen Elizabeth II dies, the next royal to take the throne is her son, Prince Charles. The public may think that Philip could be next in line, but according to succession rules, that\u2019s simply not the case. As Royal Central notes, Charles will take the throne next \u2014 and from there, it\u2019s up to him to decide what happens next. Charles will get to decide whether his father will be next in line for the throne after him, or if William is up next. As Marlene Koeing, a royal historian, notes, \u201cWe won\u2019t know until Charles is king.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also unlikely Prince Philip would move, too. Koeing said, \u201cI doubt he would be uprooted. He stays at Sandringham, liking Wolferton.\u201d\n\nBoth royals appear to be in good health as of now\n\nThey may be elderly, but there\u2019s no doubt that these two royals are still in good health. Daily Express reports the queen is in \u201cremarkable health\u201d and has not spoken of retirement any time soon. And Prevention notes her healthy eating habits certainly contribute to her longevity, too.\n\nPhilip retired from royal engagements back in 2017, but there\u2019s little concern of his health failing him thus far. The public has noticed he\u2019s not around as much anymore, though, and it\u2019s been reported that he\u2019s needed a few surgeries. Even so, it seems we don\u2019t have to worry about any sudden changes in the royal family just yet.\n\nCheck out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!"}

{"label": true, "txt": "Supernatural fans who have long championed a spinoff centered around Kim Rhodes\u2019 Sheriff Jody Mills and her surrogate daughters are finally getting their wish. On Thursday, the Wayward Sisters backdoor pilot makes its debut (The CW, 8/7c), and the female-led offshoot\u2019s timing couldn\u2019t be more, well, timely.\n\n\u201cNow is the time that television and movies are discovering that a lot of women want to have their stories told by women, [and] they want to have their voices heard,\u201d Briana Buckmaster, who plays Jody\u2019s friend/ally Sheriff Donna Hanscum, says. \u201cThis is an opportunity that Supernatural and The CW is giving to all of us as a viewership and a fandom.\u201d\n\nHer Wayward co-star Katherine Ramdeen, aka Jody\u2019s surrogate daughter Alex Jones, echoes the sentiment: \u201cStarting off 2018 with this powerful show, with six powerful, strong, female leads, is exactly what the world needs right now. I think people are going to love it.\u201d\n\nThe sisterhood \u2014 which also includes hunter Claire Novak (Kathryn Newton), psychic Patience (Clark Backo) and dreamwalker Kaia (Yadira Guevara-Prip) \u2014 is brought together by a rescue mission after Dean and Sam go missing. (Quick refresher: They got transported to The Bad Place, unbeknownst to Jody & Co.) Like many of the Wayward characters, Alex \u201cowes the boys her life,\u201d Ramdeen notes. \u201cI think she thinks of them as uncles. So she wants to help in any way she can.\u201d\n\nBut the episode is not about propping up Dean and Sam. \u201cThe women in the pilot are not there to solely serve the Winchesters, or to serve any men. They\u2019re there to help others and save themselves,\u201d Buckmaster says. \u201cThat\u2019s an exciting opportunity for viewers to see six regular women from all walks of life learning to save themselves and be their own heroes.\u201d\n\nWith so many diverse characters, the dynamics among the ensemble are bound to be as complicated as they are rich. Case in point: When prodigal daughter Claire returns home, she finds that her bed is being occupied by Patience, who \u201ccomes from a different background than a lot of the women,\u201d Buckmaster explains. \u201cA lot of the women come from rougher beginnings, and Patience was raised at a little bit of a higher class. It will be interesting to see what that character brings, or learns, even.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, established faves Claire and Alex \u2014 the latter of whom is now living a \u201cdouble life\u201d as a nursing assistant and a part-time hunter \u2014 are \u201cas close to sisters as sisters can be,\u201d even if they\u2019re not blood siblings, Ramdeen shares. \u201cAlex loves Claire, and Claire loves Alex, but sisters can fight and just annoy each other.\u201d At the end of the day, however, \u201cit\u2019s such a loving relationship that they\u2019re able to press each others\u2019 buttons, but know that there\u2019s love behind that.\u201d\n\nAs Jody opens her home and heart to even more lost young women with Patience and Kaia, the potential spinoff establishes that it has more in common with its mothership series than just hunters and monsters. \u201cThere\u2019s a saying in Supernatural: \u2018Family doesn\u2019t end with blood,\u2019 and that\u2019s the show,\u201d Ramdeen says. \u201cThat\u2019s Wayward.\u201d\n\nWatch a trailer for the episode airing this Thursday, then hit the comments with your hopes for the offshoot."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Secrets were revealed and lives were forever changed in Younger's Season 5 premiere. The game-changing episode was jam-packed with so much intense drama for Liza (Sutton Foster), Charles (Peter Hermann) and Kelsey (Hilary Duff) that in some ways it felt like a season finale. But a certain someone was missing from the beginning of Younger Season 5: Josh (Nico Tortorella). Aside from a brief conversation between Liza and Kelsey in the first few minutes of the Season 5 premiere about Josh's wedding, Liza's newly married ex was nowhere to be seen in the episode.\n\nRest assured, Josh is finally back in this week's episode, and while Tortorella (who uses they/them pronouns) was as sad as all Josh fans were that their character wasn't in the premiere, they think it was for the best. \"There is some big stuff coming and I think it leaves the fans with the exact feeling you're having right now of wanting him even more coming up in the future,\" they tell Bustle. \"I mean, the finale was so Josh-centric that I feel like it needed some air to breathe, you know?\"\n\nThe last time Younger fans saw Josh, he was tying the knot with Claire (Anastasia Barzee) despite only knowing her for one month. He had a mild case of cold feet, and almost got back together with Liza the night before the ceremony, but much to Liza's dismay he ended up going through with the wedding. When he does return to NYC, he'll have his new bride at his side.\n\nTVLand\n\n\"We'll find him back in New York City navigating what it means to be married after a month plus,\" Tortorella teases. \"That obviously comes with its hardships and its struggles.\"\n\nBut what the actor is most excited for fans to see from Josh's storyline this season is how Josh's relationship has evolved with Liza to a place that he's all too familiar with, because it's inspired in part by his real-life love life.\n\n\"We'll get to see a really special relationship between Josh and Liza as they're moving from this heavily romantic relationship to one platonic in nature and almost familial,\" Tortorella says. \"That's something that's really important in my life with any past relationships that I've had, I'm best friends with a lot of my exes. I don't even like calling them exes honestly. It is something that you don't really see on television, like ever. I'm happy to bring a piece of that to the small screen.\"\n\nTVLand\n\nBut fans who root for Josh and Liza to end up together shouldn't worry \u2014 Tortorella promises that their will-they-won't-they love story is far from over. \"That question will never go away,\" Tortorella says with a laugh. \"This is a Darren Star show. Claire very much so is a band-aid for a deeply open wound. I don't think the band-aid is quite big enough.\"\n\nWhile they can't go into specifics, Tortorella warns that there is definitely some trouble ahead for Josh. \"Josh has got to do some work on himself and some things happen at the beginning of this season that really smack him in the face,\" Tortorella says. \"I think Josh needs to fall in love with himself a little bit more.\"\n\nTVLand\n\nTortorella wants Josh to find happiness first and foremost in himself, but deep down, they ship their character with Liza. \"For the sake of the show, I want to see Josh and Liza end up together,\" Tortorella says with a laugh. \"That would make me very happy.\"\n\nRight now, it doesn't take much to make Tortorella happy \u2014 they're already on cloud nine after the debut of their book All of It Is You, a collection of original poetry exploring \"all of it,\" from the smallest cells in our bodies to the outer limits of our universe. The result of 45 straight days of doing nothing but writing, Tortorella's been overwhelmed by the response the book has gotten so far.\n\n\"It hits me at such a soul level,\" Tortorella says. \"I had a live reading at a bookstore in Brooklyn and it was my first live show. There is this musical component that lives with the poetry where it's almost like this moving meditation sound bath. There were probably 75 people that came to it and when they came to the book signing afterwards, the way that the people looked at me, it was like I'm finally seen. I'm creating work that's mine but is ours to have, ours as in the collective spirit.\"\n\nTVLand\n\nTortorella's voice gets huskier and slows down as they dive deeper into the meaning of All of It Is You. \"It really celebrates this oneness, this divine frequency of love that runs between all of us,\" they say. \"It's the type of thing that once it's recognized and celebrated, you can never un-see it. All over the world, on social media, people are celebrating it and celebrating themselves and that's the whole point, celebrating yourself while reading the book. It's just having this global impact right now that is just beyond any words that I can even comprehend. There's something so much bigger happening than the book \u2013 the book is a vehicle for the message. It is the chariot of god in one way or another and I am just a conduit for the message \u2026 if that wasn't space cadet enough for you.\"\n\nTortorella emits a self-deprecating laugh, but it's clear that their passion for poetry is real. They've already begun developing a follow-up book inspired by the reaction to All of It Is You, and they have so many ideas that it's hard to narrow it down to just one.\n\n\"I want to hone it in on different sections and explore some different parts of my life and the collective life in longer form prose and verse and essays and nonfiction and fiction,\" Tortorella says. \"I want to keep playing with this mixed media idea.\" But first up for Tortorella is filming another season of Younger, since the TVLand comedy was just renewed for Season 6 ... and they're already campaigning for more Josh, including finally finding out his last name."}

And now Messing is finally revealing her skincare secrets to the world, opening up about how she stays looking so young year after year.\n\nFor many TV fans, Messing has been a familiar face since 1998, when she first hit the small screen as Grace Adler in Will and Grace.\n\nAnd while the sitcom hit headlines again this year when it returned to the air more than ten years after it was cancelled, Debra's flawless complexion also became the subject of much public interest, as fans marveled at just how youthful and wrinkle-free she looked, more than 20 years after the show's initial premiere.\n\nDefying gravity! Will & Grace star Debra Messing has opened up about the pricey $1,700 list of products she uses to keep her skin looking so young and wrinkle-free\n\nOpen book: Debra, pictured in a promo image for Will & Grace taken in the late '90s, previously revealed she has numerous allergies including white fish, chicken, gluten and broccoli\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a Then and now: Although the actress, pictured left in 2000 and right in October, has spent more than 20 years in the entertainment industry, she has maintained her youthful looks\n\nSo just what is the secret to her youthful looks? According to the actress, who turned 50 in August, it really isn't anything special.\n\n'Drinking a ton of water, eating very, very clean, getting sleep, and carving out time for wellness,' she says of how she maintains her healthy glow.\n\nSo far it sounds pretty achievable \u2013 drinking water and sleeping is free for everyone.\n\nBut in a recent interview with Forbes, Messing opened up about a few more of the anti-aging weapons in her arsenal: her favorite skincare products.\n\nWhile talking through the staples in her bathroom cabinet, the Will & Grace actress admitted she has 'so many [products] that I love', before giving a glimpse into the rather lengthy - and pricey - regimen she follows in order to keep her skin looking as young and fresh as possible.\n\nDebra starts with a double cleanse of the Joanna Vargas Vitamin C Face Wash $40 (\u00a332), followed by the iS Clinical Cleansing Complex $40 (\u00a331.99) because, she says, 'They are both great for sensitive skin.'\n\nThe actress then layers different essences - a staple of any Korean beauty routine - opting to rely on the Klairs Supple Preparation Facial Toner $22 (\u00a322.99) and the Missha Time Revolution The First Treatment Essence $49 (\u00a325.18).\n\nDebra then uses serums like the Niod Copper Amino Acid Isolate Serum $60 (\u00a338) because it 'evens out my skintone'.\n\nMoving forward: Debra, pictured left in 1990 and right in 2018, turned 50 in August, and has now opened up about the secrets of maintaining her ageless appearance\n\nRoutine: Debra, pictured in a 2000 episode of Will & Grace, admits that she has a rather impressive arsenal of pricey skincare in her bathroom cabinet that help her to look her best\n\nBack again: The starlet returned to screens in the Will & Grace reboot earlier this year, prompting many to marvel at her wrinkle-free complexion\n\nPraise: Fans of the actress have been taking to Twitter to comment on her youthful looks\n\nBut that isn't the only serum in her regular rotation; she also likes to use the Amorepacific Moisture Bound Rejuvenating Serum $100 (\u00a3129.99) or the Joanna Vargas Vitamin C Rescue Serum $150 (\u00a3115).\n\nAnd even after indulging in all of those products, this is by no means the end of Debra's elaborate routine.\n\nNext up is moisturizer - and like many beauty lovers, Debra doesn't just stick to one.\n\nInstead, she likes to rotate through a variety of pricey face creams, revealing that her favorites include the Augustinus Bader The Cream $265 (\u00a3205), Joanna Vargas's Daily Hydrating Cream $75 (\u00a360), and the Amorepacific Time Response Skin Renewal Cream $450 (\u00a3356).\n\nThe actress will then finish off her lengthy skincare regimen with an eye cream, choosing from products like La Mer's The Illuminating Eye Gel $155 (\u00a384.99) - which sadly appears to no longer be available - or the Neocutis Lumiere Riche Bio-restorative Eye Balm $108 (\u00a385).\n\nDebra also mentions her love of face masks, praising the Joanna Vargas Sheet Masks $75 (\u00a358) in particular, as well as K-Beauty favorite Hanacure, which offers an at-home treatment set for $110 (\u00a387) that comes complete with an array of products that can be mixed at home to create the perfect DIY facial.\n\n$1,700 (\u00a31,400) to flawless skin!

Last year she appeared on the cover of Haute Living and reportedly gave a very extensive list of food stipulations for the magazine's party.\n\nPage Six revealed her food allergies included: 'ALL WHITE FISH, chicken, mushrooms, gluten, dairy, butter (except feta and goat cheese). Debra does not eat game, beans, yogurt, broccoli, cauliflower. She is lactose intolerant. She cannot have cheese or milk (only coconut milk).'\n\nThe list continued: 'Additional Allergies: Debra is allergic to wool, cats, cashmere, down feathers, FLOWERS and gabardine [a type of woven cloth]. The only flower she is not allergic to is orchids.'\n\nDebra also works out three times a week, which Healthy Celeb says involves spinning, weightlifting, circuit training, yoga and Pilates."}

He revealed he was becoming a father for the second time during his acceptance speech for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series at the 2017 Emmys.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so happy. Wow! Thank you guys so much. This is nuts,\u201d Glover, 34, began in his speech in September. \u201cI really want to thank the Academy again, everybody in here, you guys. I love you.

{"label": true, "txt": "Valentine\u2019s Day is around the corner, and what better way to prepare for one of the most stressful but simultaneously love-filled days of the year than by comparing your gift ideas with those of the rich and famous?\n\nCelebrities are notorious for going over the top when it comes to birthdays, the holidays, Valentine\u2019s Day, or really any special occasion that involves giving and receiving presents. But even in the world of the rich and famous, there are some people that take it to the next level.\n\nSo, whether you\u2019re still looking for ideas on what to get your loved one, have no plans on Valentine\u2019s Day, or just want to daydream about receiving lavish gifts like the ones below, we\u2019ve rounded up some of the crazier presents in recent memory.\n\nAn entire private island\n\nJAY-Z allegedly bought Beyonc\u00e9 an entire island for her 29th birthday in 2010, with reports at the time claiming the rapper spent $20 million on the 12.5-acre piece of land off the coast of Florida.\n\nAs expensive as the gift was, it wasn\u2019t exactly a difficult purchase, as a quick Google search shows that several websites offer islands all over the world \u2014 albeit for a hefty price. So, if you\u2019ve ever dreamed of owning a floating piece of land, you\u2019re only a few mouse clicks away.\n\nEver heard about diversifying your bonds?\n\nThis past Christmas, Kanye West bequeathed Kim Kardashian West more than $200,000 in stocks from Apple, Netflix, and adidas. West could have easily purchased Kardashian something more materialistic, but instead, he looked to the future \u2014 not that we think the power couple will be running out of money anytime soon.\n\nNot only were the gifts unique, but it was a mature move. By showing his fans that thinking about and investing in your future is cool, Kanye may have inspired a few to quit wasting money on sneakers and clothes, and instead to invest in something that will make them money.\n\nRecord labels give gifts too\n\nLady Gaga\u2019s record label, Interscope Records, got the entertainer an all-white horse for Christmas two years ago. Gaga, who is obsessed with horses, seemed overjoyed at the gesture, promising to \u201clove her forever.\u201d Remember people: a horse is for life, not just for Christmas.\n\nA piece of artwork from Jeff Koons\n\nWhen you have friends in high places, as Rihanna most certainly does, you can expect the odd extravagant present. This Muhammad Ali book x dolphin Jeff Koons original piece was gifted to the singer by none other than her creative director/executive, Ciarra Pardo. We\u2019re not sure how much it cost exactly, but considering several of Jeff Koons\u2019 art pieces have sold for millions, we\u2019re betting it didn\u2019t come cheap.\n\nWhat the sculpture means \u2014 or is supposed to be \u2014 remains up for debate, but Rihanna seemed to think it was \u201cso sexy\u201d and probably found the perfect spot for it in her house.\n\nOffset\u2019s new Rolls Royce\n\nCardi B and Offset are the hottest couple in celebrity land, a fact that was cemented when the \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d rapper bought her finac\u00e9e a brand new custom Rolls Royce for his 26th birthday. Offset returned the favor by having Cardi\u2019s name tattooed on his neck.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t enough, she even got him a Wraith watch to match. For more footage from the rapper\u2019s birthday night, check out our original piece on the gift here.\n\nWhen bae surprises you with a Bentley\n\nA post shared by Kylie Jenner Snapchats (@kylizzlesnapchats) on Aug 31, 2016 at 4:46pm PDT\n\nKylie Jenner bought her then-boyfriend Tyga a Bentley after his Ferrari was allegedly repossessed. Jenner was out at the dealership when the pesky paparazzi photographed her, most likely in a bid to spoil the surprise. The reality TV star then had to lie to Tyga about her whereabouts to avoid ruining the gift. Judging by how happy and surprised he seems in the video above, it looks like her plan worked.\n\nIf getting a brand new luxury car right after you lose your other one for missing payments doesn\u2019t scream extravagance, we don\u2019t know what does.\n\nFlowers for days\n\nBack when Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez were still a thing, there were reports that the \u201cBaby\u201d singer wanted to fill Gomez\u2019s house up with flowers. The florist he ended up hiring for this extravagant display of affection allegedly had to use every single flower in the shop to complete the order, delivering the flowers in multiple trucks.\n\nSo not only did Bieber buy every last flower in the shop, he had them delivered by the truckload \u2014 that\u2019s a power Valentine\u2019s Day move if there ever was one. Of course, the It-couple ended up breaking up later on, so we\u2019re not quite sure how effective the gesture ultimately was.\n\nCheesy AF\n\nImagine loving cheese and being gifted an entire cheese wheel to eat your pasta and risotto out of? That\u2019s exactly what John Legend got Chrissy Teigen for Christmas, fulfilling what she called a \u201clifelong dream.\u201d When you\u2019re as rich as these two, you don\u2019t worry about having enough plates, you worry about having enough cheese to mix into whatever pasta you\u2019re having that night.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re actually struggling for Valentine\u2019s Day gift ideas, check out our last minute gift guide here.\n\nSubscribe\n\nMain & Featured Image: ANGELA WEISS / AFP / Getty Images\n\nIn Post Image 1: Mike Coppola / Getty Images\n\nIn Post Image 2: Jason Merritt / Getty Images\n\nWords by Fabian Gorsler Footwear Staff Writer My mum says I won\u2019t win a Pulitzer writing about Supreme.

Why is James Franco allowed in? Said too much. Nite love ya #goldenglobes,\" Sheedy wrote, according to screenshots captured by various publications.\n\nShe then tweeted, \"Ok wait. Bye.

The episode also ended with a fight between our Present Day Beth and Randall, because Randall refused to drop out of the city council race, when the polls show he won\u2019t win and his wife asks him to give up and come back to helping his family.\n\nThat spat led to Randall sleeping on the couch, and a not so happy vibe between the happy couple in the present, with some hints in the future indicating the two are only communicating between Adult Tess.

I think it\u2019s just really brilliant storytelling and, Dan\u2019s old favorite way of describing the show is the mixed up videotapes of home videos. This is exactly that, but we\u2019re leaning a little bit into the future aspect of it.\u201d\n\nBrown previously told EW that we do in fact know this character already.\n\n\u201cIt is someone that we have met over the first two seasons, so it won\u2019t be something that comes out of nowhere,\u201d Brown said. \u201cDan has already spoken to the fact that we\u2019ve already shot parts of how he wants the series to end that\u2019s dealing with that particular \u2018her\u2019 as well.

And I definitely never doubted her ability to win another Grand Slam title one year \u2014 almost to the day \u2014 of becoming a mom. She is a superstar athlete who does everything with one goal in mind: winning. Perhaps that\u2019s why, in previous years, it never crossed my mind that Serena is just like me. But as she opened up about pregnancy, her harrowing birth story and the vulnerability of motherhood, we all started to feel that way. Last week, on the eve of her return to the U.S. Open, I sat down with Williams on \"Today\" to talk about her Grand Slam goals, embracing her critics and how she works through \"mom guilt\" with the help a few million friends on social media. Do you feel joyful? Williams: You know, I feel a different joy. I've always been this joyful person, but now it's just totally different. I feel just light. I feel lighter and happier. And it's just a great feeling. Read more at: Serena Williams runs to hit a return to Carina Witthoeft during day three of the 2018 U.S.\n\nDuring the 2017 United States Open, Serena Williams, holder of 23 Grand Slam titles, was fighting for her life. She had just given birth to Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr. by cesarean section and faced life-threatening complications from a pulmonary embolism and blood clotting. She would be bedridden for six weeks. One year later, she is back on the U.S. Open courts, attempting to tie Margaret Court\u2019s record of 24 Grand Slam titles. Her return, which has included a run to the Wimbledon final in July, should be surprising to exactly no one. Williams has joined a league of simultaneously ordinary and extraordinary women, those who return to work after childbirth and quickly perform at a very high level. Elite athletes just have a different kind of office environment awaiting them. In 1960, two years after giving birth to her daughter, the sprinter Wilma Rudolph won three gold medals at the Rome Olympics. Sheryl Swoopes returned to the basketball court six weeks after giving birth to her son. She led the Houston Comets to the 1997 W.N.B.A. championship. The Scottish golfer Catriona Matthew won the Women\u2019s British Open in August 2009, 10 weeks after giving birth to her second daughter. The British heptathlete Jessica Ennis-Hill gave birth to her first son in July 2014. She won gold at the world championships 13 months later. Because of a lack of scientific data, there are few studies on elite athletes who give birth and return to the highest levels of competition soon thereafter, said Miho Tanaka\u200b, director of the women\u2019s sports medicine program at Johns Hopkins. When it comes to following medical advice, these athletes must look toward individualized recommendations and their innate ability to be hyper-aware of their own bodies. Whatever attributes allow elite athletes to get to their level of fitness and bounce back from injury with greater speed can surely help them return to sport after childbirth, Tanaka said. \u201cBut what that mechanism is \u2014 whether that\u2019s physical or mental, or both \u2014 that formula would be hard to translate.\u201d Cordelia Carter, director of the Women\u2019s Sports Medicine Center at N.Y.U. Langone Health, said Williams had an uncomplicated pregnancy but a very complicated postpartum period, and she continues to achieve above and beyond what many, rightly or wrongly, thought was possible. \u201cSo looking at her, we don\u2019t yet know our limits, which is powerful,\u201d she said.

Read more at: Creating the life of a parent within the legend of a champion\n\nLB: So as you\u2019re the first cover of the Badass issue, what are your tips for being a badass woman? SW: You have to be confident. Someone who\u2019s a badass is incredibly confident and unapologetically herself. And she doesn\u2019t care what anyone else says\u2014but in a positive, not a negative, way. It\u2019s more like standing up for yourself and others. The whole #MeToo movement, those women are badass. They\u2019re not afraid to say what\u2019s wrong and what affected them. LB: When is the first time you remember being unapologetic? SW: That\u2019s a good question. I don\u2019t know. It took me a while because I\u2019ve faced so much criticism, whether it was about my body or something else\u2014it was always something. I always felt like I had to be softer or apologize, kind of indirectly, for who I am. And I don\u2019t know when it happened, but something changed. I just became who I am and realized there\u2019s nothing wrong with me. I understand who I am. I\u2019m the most impatient person [laughs]. I\u2019m like, \u201cNow, now, now, now, now!\u201d So I know there\u2019s some room for improvement. LB: What would you say to girls who don\u2019t really feel they have a voice? How would you tell them to be a badass in their family and their community? SW: Being a girl is not easy\u2014in some areas especially. You have to be really brave. And I realize I am saying this from the United States, so I have an opportunity to speak more than the next person\u2014I\u2019m saying that with the understanding that maybe they can\u2019t. It\u2019s really just about being aware and educating yourself so you can help other people be aware. Once you do that, even if you reach one person, that\u2019s more than none.

Pitters recommends redoing interlock sew-ins every 6 weeks and the braided sew-in version every 8 to 10 weeks. Avoid oils. Avoid oils. If you have glue-on bonded extensions, oils will break down the extension glue. And that is something that you don\u2019t want to happen until you are ready to remove your pieces.

{"label": true, "txt": "Was there ever a world without Sharknado, and what will a world look like without it? On Wednesday, March 28, SyFy announced on Twitter that the art film series Sharknado is ending with Sharknado 6. It is not yet titled. Based on previous entries in the incredible saga, it wouldn't be a surprise to see the network call Sharknado 6 \"The Last One,\" \"Armageddon\", or just \"Sharknado.\" For those with less time on their hands, here's what you need to know: The SyFy network intentionally made an over-the-top B-movie called Sharknado, which combines the devastation of tornadoes with the horror of airborne sharks. It stars Ian Ziering from Beverly Hills, 90210, and Tara Reid, whose entire career led up to that moment.\n\nIn short, the films are incredible. The five Sharknado movies are wonderful and unwatchable, and if you stare too long into the abyss of a Sharknado, the abyss will surely stare back. In order, the Sharknado series has been titled Sharknado; Sharknado 2: The Second One; Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!; Sharknado 4: The 4th Awakens, which is a pun on The Force Awakens and is so bad, you wonder how the company wasn't sued, and Sharknado 5: Global Swarming.\n\nThe final Sharknado will air in August 2018, per Twitter and CNN. CNN also reported that \"the new movie's plot will reportedly involve Ziering's character going back in time to try and undo the damage the sharks have done to the world,\" and that had better be true, because it's absolutely breathtaking.\n\nThe SyFy network has often run programming counter to Discovery Channel's annual Shark Week, and one eagle-eyed Twitter user suggests that the Sharknado 6 premiere will coincide with the annual festivities. SyFy upped its own ante in the past, bringing \"Sharknado Week\" to the masses to hype fans up for the release of Sharknado 5. Whether this is truly the end of Sharknado Week, as the same Twitter user hypothesized, remains to be soon. At the very least, fans will always have the six films to reflect on in periods of darkness.\n\nAt the risk of attributing too much science to a television movie whose title is a portmanteau of \"shark\" and \"tornado,\" one has to wonder what a time-travel element will entail. After all, sharks are among the oldest living creatures known today. If Ziering's character is meant to travel back far enough to stop the eventual destructive tendencies of the modern shark, how far back must he travel? Will he attempt to halt evolution? How will he determine when is \"just enough\" for the species? How will he do it in general? After all, time doesn't exist in a vacuum; to press pause on the development of shark-kind will likely have a ripple effect, even if this is Sharknado.\n\nIntroducing time travel to the plot unzips the fabric of the Sharknado universe, too. Sure, the film series defies all reason as is, but they'll at least have to explain how time travel becomes a thing, right? Hopefully, fans will see Ziering in some form of time machine. Or, perhaps, visiting parallel universes wherein Sharknados pose zero threat to humanity? Free idea alert.\n\nHonestly, the Sharknado films are ridiculous, and not in a bad way. They're perfect to leave on in the background at a party, or for a marathon watch session when you're hungover and lost the remote in bed somewhere. Provided you can handle a little CGI gore, that is. Or, a lot of it, depending on which sequel you pick. If you can handle barely-animated aquatic life launching out of the sea, occasionally catching fire, and landing on people's faces in the process, this is the series for you. Sharknado is a joke, and it knows that, but all good jokes come to an end eventually."}

{"label": true, "txt": "\"It's hard to pick one character because everyone is so perfect for their character, and it's so different,\" Laura Prepon tells THR.\n\nThe upside of Orange Is the New Black's large cast \u2014 more than 30 regular or recurring parts among the Litchfield inmates alone \u2014 is that no one actor, not even first-billed Taylor Schilling, has to carry too much of the load.\n\nThe downside? The sprawling ensemble and multiple storylines mean that some of the cast rarely works together, if at all. More so than with many other series, the OITNB actresses watch the show as fans, too, and as such they have their own favorite storylines and characters.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter asked for the cast's favorite stories that don't directly involve their characters, as well as which of their co-stars they like to watch work.\n\nRuby Rose (Stella)\n\n\"At the very beginning, I was very much into the Piper-Alex scenario. It's hard not to be. I was very invested in that relationship, just like millions of other people. Then the show went on and you got to understand more of the other characters, and it became more clear it was really an ensemble cast. I got very invested in Poussey and Taystee's relationship as well. ... And Lorna Morello, played by Yael [Stone], also captured my heart a little bit with her vulnerability.\"\n\nSamira Wiley (Poussey)\n\n\"Always Kate Mulgrew. Kate has such an amazing energy on set. She commands this presence that's so admirable, and it makes you step back. I love seeing her onscreen. The way she handles her scenes ... just walking down the hallway is amazing.\"\n\nLea DeLaria (Big Boo)\n\n\"I never get to work with Uzo [Aduba], and I'm always happy when she's onscreen. We did that daggering thing in season one, but that was really the only time I've gotten to work with her. ... Really interesting choices she makes with her character \u2014 like when I read it, I'll think, that's funny. But then Uzo will take it and turn it on a dime. She'll take a line that was probably meant for comedy, and she'll punch you right in the gut with it. And she's right.\"\n\nDanielle Brooks (Taystee)\n\n\"I love the relationship that's developing between Gloria and Sophia. I think Selenis [Levya] is just an amazing actress. It's so cool to watch her in the kitchen and the struggle with her son. I also really enjoy the backstories this season. You already got the backstories of the main characters, but now you're getting some of the backstories of the secondary characters, which you realize are not secondary characters. Everyone has an arc here and is really leaving a stamp in the show. It's really cool to watch the backstories of characters you weren't expecting to get.\"\n\nAdrienne Moore (Black Cindy)\n\n\"I'm always eager to see what Taryn Manning is gonna do. She likes to take the odd note. If you know anything about music, you have your chords but then you have those off-chords, and I think she finds those a lot in her character. And she's a musician, so a lot of her music is in her character. She's definitely someone who can be in her character and in that moment, and then step away and talk about how she has a DJing job in Florida next week.\"\n\nKate Mulgrew (Red)\n\n\"Adrienne Moore, Uzo Aduba, Danielle Brooks and Samira Wiley. That's the tribe, and Red doesn't have much to do with them. I miss them because they're wildly talented, and every time I work with them, it's an unexpected thing. They're incredibly inventive and I love their energy. I feel that about the Latinas as well, but I have them in the kitchen.\"\n\nTaylor Schilling (Piper)\n\n\"I love to watch everybody, but I never work with Chang [Lori Tan Chin] ever, so whenever she's working and she's before me or after me, I try to watch her because she's genius. So spicy! She is so unexpected. I never know what she's gonna do, and I find her to be such a brilliant actress that I never have scenes with.\"\n\nLaura Prepon (Alex)\n\n\"That's what's so fun about the show. Because the cast is so big, there's a lot of times where I don't have any storylines with like half the cast. That's what's also fun about watching the show \u2014 I've read all the scripts, but then I get to see what the girls do with it, and these women are such great actresses, it's so fun to watch.

But the real magic of the Menil bungalows lies in the special community and camaraderie that have blossomed around them.\n\nAs a part of our ongoing series about people living and working in the Menil bungalows, we step inside the design studio of Michael Landrum and Garrett Hunter and the home of The Pass & Provisions chef Seth Siegel-Gardner, ad exec wife Hannah and toddler Levi.\n\nGarrett Hunter\u2019s office, with a large work by Jos\u00e9 Lerma, sculpture by Amber Eagle and orange collage by Christopher Cascio.\n\nStudio & Offices of Designers Michael Landrum and Garrett Hunter\n\nThe charming gray bungalows first landed on architect Michael Landrum\u2019s radar six years ago, when he joined the Menil Contemporaries, the museum\u2019s organization for young collectors. A native of San Antonio with a masters in architecture from UT Austin, Landrum was new to Houston and had purchased a house in the Museum District.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d been looking for office space for quite a long time and thought, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t these bungalows be ideal?\u2019\u201d he says. He scheduled an appointment to see the only one available, a duplex for rent with a two-story work/live space. The leasing agent had scheduled two other people to view the bungalow at the same time, but Landrum was escorted in first.\n\nShop FFT Swipe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext\n\nHe walked in the front door with its two-story entry surrounded by a mezzanine, and was smitten. Without taking another step, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll take it. You don\u2019t need to show it to anyone else.\u201d\n\nFor the first few years, the bungalow was used as a collaborative between Landrum, architect Karen Lantz and interior designer Garrett Hunter. Lantz eventually moved out, and when the remaining part of the duplex became available, Landrum and Hunter took over both spaces.\n\nHunter, who hails from East Texas, worked for many years under Pam Kuhl at Kuhl-Linscomb before teaming up with Landrum. They turned the double-height entry into a conference room dominated by a 17th-century Italian refectory table, a light installation by Austin artist Andy Coolquitt and large-scale works by New York\u2019s Judith Supine and Eddie Martinez, and L.A. artist Retna. There are also several works by the de Menils\u2019 late great-grandson, artist Dash Snow. The interior walls are painted Menil gray for consistency inside and out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s furnished like a traditional turn-of-the-century architect\u2019s studio, with a mix of antique and modern furniture and art \u2014 very Stanford White,\u201d Landrum says, referring to the late-19th-century architect known for his classical houses for wealthy Rhode Islanders and numerous public, institutional and religious buildings in New York.\n\nThe location of their offices couldn\u2019t be more perfect. \u201cWe both agree that the proximity to the Menil is such a benefit \u2014 and such an inspiration,\u201d Landrum says. \u201cWe do work out of town, but most of our jobs are from this area. It\u2019s such a strong visual connection.\u201d\n\nNeighbors include a social worker, a poet, artists and artisans. \u201cThere\u2019s a very strong sense of community here. It\u2019s part of the strength of the Menil,\u201d Landrum says.\n\nThe gray bungalows have become a cultural touchstone, much like the Chateau Marmont Hotel in Los Angeles or the Algonquin Hotel in New York. \u201cI\u2019m constantly surprised when I mention that I practice in Houston to someone from New York or L.A., and they already know about the gray bungalows,\u201d Hunter says.\n\nPart of their mystique can be attributed to their idyllic setting inside the Menil\u2019s 30-acre campus. Many of the bungalows face Menil Park, with its old-growth oak trees and landscaping of oleanders, crape myrtles and bamboo, as originally conceived by Renzo Piano and Dominique de Menil.\n\n\u201cIn the past two or three years, the park has been an eruption of outdoor activity,\u201d says Hunter. \u201cIt\u2019s a great place to bike.\u201d During the week, they\u2019ll walk to Bistro Menil for lunch or hang out at the Menil bookstore, which a friend operates. Their bungalow has hosted dinners for visiting museum lecturers, out-of-town gallerists and artists. Painter and filmmaker Lola Schnabel used it as her studio space for a week while she was in Houston doing portrait work.\n\n\u201cIt was sort of a blast and pretty magical,\u201d Hunter says.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s constantly someone here,\u201d adds Landrum. \u201cPeople feel part of a unique, intellectual and artistic salon. It\u2019s our responsibility as tenants of the bungalows to continue that patronage of the arts that Dominique de Menil began.\u201d\n\nHannah Siegel-Gardner in a portrait taken while eight months pregnant with son Levi.\n\nSETH AND HANNAH SIEGEL-GARDNER\n\nChef Seth Siegel-Gardner\u2019s highly touted restaurants, The Pass & Provisions, are an easy five-minute excursion from the two-bedroom Menil bungalow he shares with wife, Hannah, an ad agency account executive. Seth grew up in the Montrose neighborhood, and it\u2019s where his parents still live \u2014 another advantage now that the couple has an 11-month-old son, Levi.\n\nBut what really drew them to the area was the exciting hustle and bustle of the area\u2019s outdoor cafes, shops and a walking culture that doesn\u2019t exist elsewhere in Houston, says Hannah, who grew up in West U. It\u2019s an urban lifestyle they experienced living in Chicago and New York City, where Seth helped man such high-profile kitchens as Maze by Gordon Ramsay. When Hannah was admitted into the London School of Economics and Political Science, Seth took a job as a private chef there.\n\nMoving back to Houston was a bit of a culture shock, happily mitigated by their decision to live in Montrose. \u201cWe wanted to be in an area where we could walk to things and capture that part of an urban lifestyle we\u2019d grown accustomed to,\u201d Hannah says.\n\nThey first heard about the bungalows when a childhood friend of Hannah\u2019s, a jewelry designer, moved into one. \u201cThe girl living in the one across the street from hers was moving out, and she asked the Menil management if we could get it,\u201d says Hannah.\n\nTiming is everything. The Siegel-Gardners moved into their sunny, 1,200-square-foot bungalow eight years ago. The best thing about it, she says, is the abundance of natural light. \u201cOur bedroom has a skylight, so the plants go wild in there. We also love all the little details, such as the beautiful crown molding and original wood floors.\u201d\n\nOf course, the 85-year-old house has its quirks. \u201cI\u2019ve never lived in a house this old before,\u201d Seth says. \u201cIt has its moans and groans, but it has good old bones.\u201d They love the large palm trees in the backyard and are fascinated by the remnants of a trapeze left behind by a former tenant, an acrobat. \u201c\n\n\u201cThe best part about it is the neighborhood; we\u2019ve made so many friends,\u201d Seth says. \u201cWe\u2019re always running back and forth across the street for potluck dinners, or hanging out with people before walking to a restaurant for dinner.\u201d\n\nUnderbelly restaurant is a favorite, with Blacksmith a go-to destination for coffee and sandwiches, and Hugo\u2019s for weekend brunch. They spend a lot of time in the museums, which are literally out their front door. One of Seth\u2019s favorites is the Cy Twombly Gallery at The Menil Collection (which he calls \u201ca hidden gem\u201d).\n\n\u201cI get off work pretty late and take the dogs for a walk, and it\u2019s nice walking past the Menil, all lit up inside,\u201d he says. \u201cThey do a concert series in front of the Rothko Chapel, which is fun. I like going in for a moment, as the deafening silence is a pretty good way to clear your head.\u201d\n\nThe urban walking environment of the Menil bungalows is exactly what the Siegel-Gardners were looking for. \u201cWe drive to and from work, that\u2019s it,\u201d Seth says."}

My ovary has settled in on the muscles around the sacral nerves in my back that allow us to walk. Let\u2019s please not even talk about my uterine lining. The only beautiful detail is that the organ\u2014which is meant to be shaped like a light bulb\u2014was shaped like a heart.\u201d\n\nLena says her decision to undergo the elective surgery was a tough one, following \u201cyears of complex surgeries measuring in the double digits\u201d and even alternative treatments like \u201cpelvic floor therapy, massage therapy, pain therapy, color therapy, acupuncture,\u201d and yoga.\n\nLena has been hospitalized at least three times in less than a year for endometriosis. Last April, she underwent surgery to free her ovaries from her rectal wall. Afterward, Lena declared she was endometriosis-free. But, sadly, on May 1, during her appearance at the Met Gala in NYC, she was rushed to a local hospital for complications. Days later, Lena canceled her nationwide \u201cLenny IRL\u201d tour, telling fans that she was, \u201cin the greatest amount of physical pain that I have ever experienced\" after doctors discovered more endometriosis during subsequent surgery.\n\nWith her hysterectomy now behind her, hopefully, the worst is over for Lena. The former Girls star recently announced that she'd return to HBO with a new series, Camping. But perhaps she'll soon share even happier news: Lena reveals she\u2019s determined to have children and is already exploring her options.\n\n\u201cI may have felt choiceless before, but I know I have choices now,\u201d she writes. \u201cSoon I\u2019ll start exploring whether my ovaries, which remain someplace inside me in that vast cavern of organs and scar tissue, have eggs.

In the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration last January, women flooded Washington wearing pink pussycat hats to march on the Capitol. In September, celebrities made a political statement at the 2017 Emmys by wearing blue ACLU ribbons after Trump announced his plans to end DACA.\n\nBut perhaps this year\u2019s Golden Globes could thread Hollywood\u2019s largest display of solidarity as some of the biggest names in show business pledge to don black at the 75th annual event.\n\nWith the influx of sexual misconduct allegations in entertainment \u2014 and other industries \u2014 since the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke in October, stars of the big and small screen are planning to wear all black to the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles this Sunday in support of those who have spoken out about sexual harassment and to protest gender inequality.\n\nAlong with the dark ensembles, participants will reportedly be accessorizing with pins created by Time\u2019s Up \u2014 the coalition behind the statement.\n\nCREDIT: Michael Buckner/Variety/REX/Shutterstock\n\nShonda Rhimes, Reese Witherspoon, and 300 other prominent women in the entertainment industry are behind the Time\u2019s Up initiative aimed at eradicating abuse, harassment, marginalization and underrepresentation in the work place.\n\nRelated Natalie Portman Speaks Out on 'Pervasive' Abuse in Hollywood Kerry Washington, Time's Up Leaders Among Investors in The Wing, a Women's Workspace Startup\n\nThe alliance almost decided to boycott the Golden Globe Awards entirely, Kerry Washington told the LA Times.

Her other film credits include Shampoo (1975), The Blues Brothers (1980), Hannah and Her Sisters (1986), The 'Burbs (1989), When Harry Met Sally... (1989), Soapdish (1991), and The Women (2008).[4] She was nominated twice for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her performances on the television series 30 Rock and Catastrophe. She was posthumously made a Disney Legend in 2017,[5] and in 2018 she was awarded a posthumous Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album.\n\nFisher wrote several semi-autobiographical novels, including Postcards from the Edge and an autobiographical one-woman play, and its non-fiction book, Wishful Drinking, based on the play. She wrote the screenplay for the film version of Postcards From The Edge which garnered her a BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay nomination, and her one-woman stage show of Wishful Drinking was filmed for television and received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special. She worked on other writers' screenplays as a script doctor, including tightening the scripts for Hook (1991), Sister Act (1992), The Wedding Singer (1998), and many of the films from the Star Wars franchise, among others.[6] In later years, she earned praise for speaking publicly about her experiences with bipolar disorder and drug addiction.[7]\n\nFisher was the daughter of singer Eddie Fisher and actress Debbie Reynolds. Her mother and she appear in Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds, a documentary about their relationship. It premiered at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival. Fisher died of a sudden cardiac arrest on December 27, 2016, at age 60, four days after experiencing a medical emergency during a transatlantic flight from London to Los Angeles. One of her final films, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, was released on December 15, 2017 and is dedicated to her.[8][9] Fisher will appear in Star Wars: Episode IX through the use of unreleased footage from The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi.[10]\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nCarrie Frances Fisher[11] was born on October 21, 1956, in Burbank, California,[12] to actors and singers Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher.[13][14][15] Fisher's paternal grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants,[16][17][18][19][20] while her mother, who was raised a Nazarene, was of Scots-Irish and English descent.[21][22][23][24]\n\nFisher was two years old when her parents divorced in 1959. Her father's third marriage, to actress Connie Stevens, resulted in the births of Fisher's two half-sisters, Joely Fisher and Tricia Leigh Fisher. In 1960, her mother married Harry Karl, owner of a chain of shoe stores. Reynolds and Karl divorced in 1973, when Fisher was 17 years old.[25]\n\nFisher \"hid in books\" as a child, becoming known in her family as \"the bookworm\".[26] She spent her earliest years reading classic literature, and writing poetry. She attended Beverly Hills High School until age 15, when she appeared as a debutante and singer in the hit Broadway revival Irene (1973), starring her mother.[27] Her time on Broadway interfered with her education, resulting in Fisher's dropping out of high school.[28] In 1973, Fisher enrolled at London's Central School of Speech and Drama, which she attended for 18 months.[26][29] Following her time there, Fisher applied to and was accepted at Sarah Lawrence College, where she planned to study the arts. She later left without graduating.[30][31][32]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\n1970s [ edit ]\n\nShe was extremely smart; a talented actress, writer and comedienne with a very colorful personality that everyone loved. In Star Wars she was our great and powerful princess\u2014feisty, wise and full of hope in a role that was more difficult than most people might think. \u2014director George Lucas[33]\n\nFisher made her film debut at age 18 as the precociously seductive character Lorna Karpf in the Columbia Pictures comedy Shampoo (1975). Lee Grant and Jack Warden play the role of her parents in the film. Warren Beatty, Julie Christie and Goldie Hawn also star in the film.[4] In 1977, Fisher starred as Princess Leia in George Lucas' science-fiction film Star Wars (later retitled Star Wars: Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope) opposite Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford.[34] At the time, she believed the script for Star Wars was fantastic, but did not expect many people to agree with her. Though her fellow actors were not close at the time, they bonded after the commercial success of the film.[35]\n\nIn April 1978, Fisher appeared as the love interest in Ringo Starr's 1978 TV special Ringo.[36] The next month, she starred alongside John Ritter (who had also appeared in Ringo) in the ABC-TV film Leave Yesterday Behind.[37] At this time, Fisher appeared with Laurence Olivier and Joanne Woodward in the anthology series Laurence Olivier Presents in a television version of the William Inge play Come Back, Little Sheba.[38] That November, she played Princess Leia in the 1978 TV production Star Wars Holiday Special, and sang in the last scene.[39]\n\n1980s [ edit ]\n\nFisher appeared in the film The Blues Brothers as Jake's vengeful ex-lover; she is listed in the credits as \"Mystery Woman\".[40] While Fisher was in Chicago filming the movie, she choked on a Brussels sprout; Dan Aykroyd performed the Heimlich maneuver and \"saved my life\".[41] She appeared on Broadway in Censored Scenes from King Kong in 1980. The same year, she reprised her role as Princess Leia in The Empire Strikes Back, and appeared with her Star Wars co-stars on the cover of the July 12, 1980 issue of Rolling Stone to promote the film.[42] She also starred as Sister Agnes in the Broadway production of Agnes of God in 1983.[43]\n\nF.I.S.T., in 1978 Fisher with Wim Wenders at a private party after the premiere of the movie, in 1978\n\nIn 1983, Fisher returned to the role of Princess Leia in Return of the Jedi, and posed in the character's metal bikini on the cover of the Summer 1983 issue of Rolling Stone to promote the film.[44][45] The costume later achieved a following of its own.[46] In 1986 she starred along with Barbara Hershey and Mia Farrow in Woody Allen's Hannah and Her Sisters.\n\nIn 1987, Fisher published her first novel, Postcards from the Edge. The book was semi-autobiographical in the sense that she fictionalized and satirized real-life events such as her drug addiction of the late 1970s and her relationship with her mother. It became a bestseller, and she received the Los Angeles Pen Award for Best First Novel. Also during 1987, she was in the Australian film The Time Guardian. In 1989 Fisher played a major supporting role in When Harry Met Sally..., and in the same year she appeared with Tom Hanks as his character's wife in The 'Burbs.[4]\n\n1990s [ edit ]\n\nIn 1990, Columbia Pictures released a film version of Postcards from the Edge, adapted for the screen by Fisher and starring Meryl Streep, Shirley MacLaine and Dennis Quaid.[47] Fisher appeared in the fantasy comedy film Drop Dead Fred in 1991, and played a therapist in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997).[4] During the 1990s, Fisher also published the novels Surrender the Pink (1990) and Delusions of Grandma (1993). Fisher wrote an episode of the television sitcom Roseanne entitled \"Arsenic and Old Mom\", in which her mother Debbie Reynolds made a guest appearance. Fisher also did uncredited script work for movies such as Lethal Weapon 3 (where she wrote some of Rene Russo's dialogue), Outbreak (also starring Russo), The Wedding Singer[48] and Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot.[49]\n\n2000s [ edit ]\n\nIn the 2000 film Scream 3, Fisher played a former actress,[50] and in 2001 she played a nun in the Kevin Smith comedy Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. She also co-wrote the TV comedy film These Old Broads (2001), of which she was also co-executive producer. It starred her mother Debbie Reynolds, as well as Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Collins and Shirley MacLaine.[51]\n\nIn addition to acting and writing original works, Fisher was one of the top script doctors in Hollywood, working on the screenplays of other writers.[52][53] She did uncredited polishes on movies in a 15-year stretch from 1991 to 2005. She was hired by George Lucas to polish scripts for his 1992 TV series The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles and the dialogue for the Star Wars prequel scripts.[52] Her expertise in this area was the reason she was chosen as one of the interviewers for the screenwriting documentary Dreams on Spec in 2007. In an interview in 2004, Fisher said she no longer did much script doctoring.[53]\n\nIn 2005, Women in Film & Video \u2013 DC recognized Fisher with the Women of Vision Award.[54]\n\nFisher also voiced Peter Griffin's boss, Angela, on the animated sitcom Family Guy[55] and wrote the introduction for a book of photographs titled Hollywood Moms, which was published in 2001.[56] Fisher published a sequel to Postcards, The Best Awful There Is, in 2004.\n\nFisher wrote and performed in her one-woman play Wishful Drinking at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles from November 2006 to January 2007.[57] Her show then played throughout 2008 at the Berkeley Repertory Theater,[58] San Jose, the Hartford Stage,[59] the Arena Stage[60] and Boston.[61] Fisher published her autobiographical book, also titled Wishful Drinking, based on her successful play in December 2008 and embarked on a media tour. In 2009, Fisher returned to the stage with her play at the Seattle Repertory Theatre.[62] Wishful Drinking then opened on Broadway in New York at Studio 54 and played an extended run from October 2009 until January 2010.[63][64] In December 2009, Fisher's audiobook recording of Wishful Drinking earned her a nomination for a 2009 Grammy Award in the Best Spoken Word Album category.[65]\n\nFisher joined Turner Classic Movies host Robert Osborne on Saturday evenings in 2007 for The Essentials with informative and entertaining conversation on Hollywood's best films. She guest-starred in the episode titled \"Sex and Another City\" from season 3 of Sex and the City with Sarah Jessica Parker. On October 25, 2007, Fisher guest-starred as Rosemary Howard on the second-season episode of 30 Rock called \"Rosemary's Baby\", for which she received an Emmy Award nomination.[66] On April 28, 2008, she was a guest on Deal or No Deal.[67] In 2008, she also had a cameo as a doctor in the Star Wars-related comedy Fanboys.\n\n2010s [ edit ]\n\nIn 2010, HBO aired a feature-length documentary based on a special live performance of Fisher's Wishful Drinking stage production.[68] At the time of her death, Fisher had been preparing a sequel to the one-woman play.[69]\n\nFisher speaking at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con International\n\nFisher appeared on the seventh season of Entourage in the summer of 2010.[68] She was among the featured performers at the Comedy Central Roast of Roseanne, which aired in August 2012. In her monologue, Fisher poked fun at her own mental illness,[70] and her fellow roasters' reliance on weight and menopause jokes.[71] Fisher joked that she had no idea why she was asked to roast Roseanne, until \"they explained that we were actually good friends, and that apparently we have worked together.\"[72] Host Jane Lynch joked that Fisher was there to add perspective to Roseanne's struggles with weight and drugs. Fellow roaster Wayne Brady poked fun at Fisher's career, saying she was the only celebrity \"whose action figure is worth more than you are.\"[73]\n\nShe was selected as a member of the main competition jury at the 2013 Venice Film Festival.[74] She filmed an appearance on the UK comedy panel show QI that was broadcast on December 25, 2014.[75] Fisher starred alongside Sharon Horgan and comedian Rob Delaney in the British comedy series Catastrophe, that was first broadcast on Channel 4 in the UK on January 19, 2015.[76][77] Her last appearance on Catastrophe, which aired in the UK on April 4, 2017, left many viewers in tears[78] and earned her a posthumous Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series nomination.\n\nIn a March 2013 interview following the announcement that a new trilogy of films would be produced, Fisher confirmed that she would reprise her role as Princess Leia in Episode VII of the Star Wars series. Fisher claimed that Leia was \"Elderly. She's in an intergalactic old folks' home [laughs]. I just think she would be just like she was before, only slower and less inclined to be up for the big battle.\"[79] After other media outlets reported this on March 6, 2013, her representative said the same day that Fisher was joking and that nothing was announced.[80]\n\nIn a January 2014 interview, Fisher confirmed her involvement and the involvement of the original cast in the upcoming sequels by saying \"as for the next Star Wars film, myself, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill are expected to report to work in March or April. I'd like to wear my old cinnamon buns hairstyle again but with white hair. I think that would be funny.\"[81]\n\nIn March 2014, Fisher stated that she was moving to London for six months because that was where Star Wars Episode VII filming would take place.[82] On April 29, 2014, the cast for the new sequel was officially announced, and Fisher, along with Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, Peter Mayhew, Anthony Daniels, and Kenny Baker, were all cast in their original roles for the film. Star Wars Episode VII, subtitled The Force Awakens, was released worldwide on December 18, 2015. Fisher was nominated for a 2016 Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal.[83]\n\nIn Rogue One (2016), which predates the original trilogy, young versions of Leia and the character Grand Moff Tarkin appear through computer animation.[84][85] Fisher had completed filming her role as Leia in Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017) shortly before her death.[86] Director Rian Johnson has stated that many of Fisher's own ideas made it into the film, and that she supplied a few of Leia's lines.[87] Variety reported following her death that Fisher was slated to appear in Episode IX, and that Lucasfilm, Disney, and others involved with the film will need to find a way to address her death and what will become of her character.[88][89][90] In July 2018, it was announced that Fisher would appear posthumously in Star Wars: Episode IX via unreleased footage from The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi.[91][10]\n\nFisher's memoir, The Princess Diarist, was released in November 2016. The book is based on diaries she kept while filming the original Star Wars trilogy in the late 1970s and early 1980s.[92][93] Her audiobook recording of the memoir earned her the 2018 Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album, awarded 13 months after her death.\n\nFisher and her mother appear in Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds,[94] a 2016 documentary about their close relationship featuring interviews, photographs and home movies. The documentary premiered at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival and broadcast on January 7, 2017.[95]\n\nShe will be featured in the film Wonderwell with Rita Ora, which was filmed in the summer of 2016 in Italy.[96]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nFisher met musician Paul Simon while filming Star Wars, and the pair dated from 1977 until 1983.[97] In 1980, she was briefly engaged to Canadian actor and comedian Dan Aykroyd, who proposed to her on the set of their film The Blues Brothers. She said: \"We had rings, we got blood tests, the whole shot. But then I got back together with Paul Simon.\"[98] Fisher was married to Simon from August 1983 to July 1984, and they dated again for a time after their divorce.[98] During their marriage, she appeared in Simon's music video for the song \"Rene and Georgette Magritte with Their Dog after the War\". Simon's song \"Hearts and Bones\" is about their romance.[99][100]\n\nShe subsequently had a relationship with Creative Artists Agency principal and talent agent Bryan Lourd. They had one child together, Billie Lourd (b. 1992). Eddie Fisher stated in his autobiography (Been There Done That) that his granddaughter's name is Catherine Fisher Lourd and her nickname is \"Billy\". The couple's relationship ended when Lourd left to be in a homosexual relationship. In interviews, Fisher described Lourd as her second husband, but a 2004 profile of the actress and writer revealed that she and Lourd were never legally married.[101]\n\nIn her 2016 autobiography The Princess Diarist, Fisher wrote that she and Harrison Ford had a three-month affair during the filming of Star Wars in 1976.[102] In 2017, Mark Hamill revealed that they had also been attracted to each other while making the film, but he resisted dating a co-star. He didn't find out about Fisher's relationship with Ford until filming had wrapped.[103]\n\nFisher also had a close relationship with singer James Blunt. While working on his album Back to Bedlam in 2003, Blunt spent much of his time at Fisher's residence. When Vanity Fair's George Wayne asked Fisher if their relationship was sexual, she replied: \"Absolutely not, but I did become his therapist. He was a soldier. This boy has seen awful stuff. Every time James hears fireworks or anything like that, his heart beats faster, and he gets 'fight or flight.' You know, he comes from a long line of soldiers dating back to the 10th century. He would tell me these horrible stories. He was a captain, a reconnaissance soldier. I became James' therapist. So it would have been unethical to sleep with my patient.\"[34]\n\nOn February 26, 2005, R. Gregory \"Greg\" Stevens, a lobbyist, was found dead in Fisher's California home. The final autopsy report listed the cause of death as \"cocaine and oxycodone use\" but added chronic, and apparently previously undiagnosed, heart disease as contributing factors. Media coverage of an initial autopsy report used the word \"overdose,\" but that wording is not in the final report.[104] In an interview, Fisher claimed that Stevens' ghost haunted her mansion, which unsettled her: \"I was a nut for a year\", she explained, \"and in that year I took drugs again.\"[34]\n\nFisher described herself as an \"enthusiastic agnostic who would be happy to be shown that there is a God\".[105] She was raised Protestant,[106] but often attended Jewish services (her father's faith) with Orthodox friends.[107]\n\nIn 2016, Harvard College gave Fisher its Annual Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism, noting that \"her forthright activism and outspokenness about addiction, mental illness, and agnosticism have advanced public discourse on these issues with creativity and empathy.\"[7]\n\nFisher was a supporter and advocate for several causes, including women's advocacy,[108] animal rights,[109] and LGBT causes.[110] She was open about her experiences caring for friends who suffered from AIDS, contributing financially to various AIDS and HIV organizations, including hosting a benefit for amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research.[111] She also served as an honorary board member for the International Bipolar Foundation,[112] and, in 2014, received the Golden Heart Award for her work with The Midnight Mission.[113]\n\nShe was a spokesperson for Jenny Craig weight loss television ads that aired in January 2011.[114]\n\nBipolar disorder and drug use [ edit ]\n\nDuring appearances on 20/20 and The Secret Life of the Manic Depressive with Stephen Fry, Fisher publicly discussed her diagnosis of bipolar disorder and her addictions to cocaine and prescription medication.[115] She said her drug use was a form of self-medication; she used pain medication such as Percodan to \"dial down\" the manic aspect of her bipolar disorder.[116] She gave nicknames to her bipolar moods: Roy (\"the wild ride of a mood\") and Pam (\"who stands on the shore and sobs\").[117] \"Drugs made me feel more normal\", she explained to Psychology Today in 2001. \"They contained me.\"[116] She discussed her 2008 memoir Wishful Drinking and various topics in it with Matt Lauer on NBC's Today that same year, and also revealed that she would have turned down the role of Princess Leia had she realized it would give her the celebrity status that made her parents' lives difficult.[118] This interview was followed by a similar appearance on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson on December 12, 2008, where she discussed her electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) treatments.[119] At one point, she received ECT every six weeks to \"blow apart the cement\" in her brain.[120] In 2014, she said she was no longer receiving the treatment.[121]\n\nIn another interview, Fisher revealed that she used cocaine during the filming of The Empire Strikes Back. \"Slowly, I realized I was doing a bit more drugs than other people and losing my choice in the matter\", she noted.[122][123] In 1985, after months of sobriety, she accidentally overdosed on a combination of prescription medication and sleeping pills.[124] She was rushed to the hospital, creating the turn of events that led to much of the material in her novel and screenplay, Postcards from the Edge. Asked why she did not take on the role of her story's protagonist, named Suzanne, in the film version, Fisher remarked, \"I've already played Suzanne.\"[125]\n\nIn her later years, Fisher had an emotional support animal, a French Bulldog named Gary, whom she brought to numerous appearances and interviews.[126] Following her death, reports indicated that Fisher's daughter Billie Lourd would take care of Gary.[127]\n\nDeath [ edit ]\n\nAfter finishing the European leg of her book tour (her last TV appearance was on an episode of The Graham Norton Show recorded four days before her death) Fisher was on a commercial flight on December 23, 2016, from London to Los Angeles when she suffered a medical emergency around fifteen minutes before the aircraft landed.[128][a] A passenger seated near Fisher reported that she had stopped breathing;[131] another passenger performed CPR on Fisher until paramedics arrived at the scene. Emergency services in Los Angeles were contacted when the flight crew reported a passenger in distress prior to landing. Fisher was taken by ambulance to the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where she was placed on a ventilator.[132][133]\n\nOn the morning of December 27, 2016, after being in intensive care for four days, Fisher died at the age of 60 at the UCLA Medical Center.[134] Fisher's daughter, Billie Lourd, confirmed her mother's death in a statement to the press.[132] Many of her co-stars and directors from Star Wars and other works also shared their thoughts on her death.[135]\n\nOn January 9, 2017, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health issued a death certificate that stated \"cardiac arrest/deferred\" as the cause of death. More tests were expected.[136] In a June 16, 2017, news release, the Los Angeles County coroner's office said that the exact cause of death could not be determined, but sleep apnea and the buildup of fatty tissue on the walls of arteries were among the contributing factors.[1] A full report from June 19, 2017, stated that Fisher had cocaine in her system, as well as traces of heroin, other opiates, and MDMA. The report also stated that the investigation was unable to determine when she had taken the drugs, and whether they contributed to her death.[137] Her daughter Billie Lourd stated that Fisher \"battled drug addiction and mental illness her entire life [and] ultimately died of it. She was purposefully open in all of her work about the social stigmas surrounding these diseases... I know my Mom, she\u2019d want her death to encourage people to be open about their struggles.\"[138]\n\nThe day after Fisher's death, her mother Debbie Reynolds suffered a stroke at the home of son Todd, where the family was planning Fisher's burial arrangements.[139] She was taken to a hospital, where she died later that afternoon.[140][141] According to Todd Fisher, Reynolds had said, \"I want to be with Carrie\" immediately prior to suffering the stroke.[142][143][b] On January 5, 2017, a joint private memorial was held for Fisher and Reynolds. A portion of Fisher's ashes were laid to rest beside Reynolds in a crypt at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills.[145] The remainder of her ashes are held in a giant, novelty Prozac pill.[146]\n\nIn her 2008 book, Wishful Drinking, Fisher wrote about what she hoped would eventually be her obituary: \"I want it reported that I drowned in moonlight, strangled by my own bra.\" Several obituaries and retrospectives featured the quote.[147] In the absence of a star for Fisher on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, fans created their own memorial using a blank star. Along with flowers and candles, words put on the blank star read, \"Carrie Fisher may the force be with you always\".[3] In the video game Star Wars: The Old Republic, thousands of fans paid tribute to Fisher by gathering at House Organa on the planet Alderaan where Fisher's character in Star Wars resided.[148][149] Lightsaber vigils and similar events in Fisher's honor were held at various Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas theaters and other sites.[150][151][152] On January 6, 2017, the lights on Broadway in Manhattan were darkened for one minute in honor of Fisher and her mother.[153] Fisher and Reynolds were also both featured in the 89th Academy Awards In Memoriam segment.[154] On March 25, 2017, a public memorial for mother and daughter was held at the Hall of Liberty theater in Forest Lawn Memorial Park. The event was streamed live on Reynolds' website. On April 14, a special tribute to Fisher was held by Mark Hamill during the Star Wars Celebration in Orlando.[155]\n\nFilmography [ edit ]\n\nFilm [ edit ]\n\nTelevision [ edit ]\n\nVideo games [ edit ]\n\nBibliography [ edit ]\n\nNovels\n\nNon-fiction\n\nScreenplays\n\nPlays\n\nWishful Drinking , 2006 [187]\n\n, 2006 Wishful Drinking , 2008 [188]\n\n, 2008 A Spy in the House of Me, 2008[189]\n\nAwards and nominations [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\n^ [129] Several news outlets called the episode a \"massive heart attack\".[130] Radio transmissions and emergency calls included the phrases \"cardiac episode\" and \"cardiac arrest\"; witnesses believed they had seen Fisher having a heart attack.Several news outlets called the episode a \"massive heart attack\". ^ [144] In an interview with ABC News , Fisher later said that his mother \"didn't die of a broken heart. ... It wasn't that she was sitting around inconsolable\u2014not at all. She simply said that she didn't get to see Carrie come back from London. She expressed how much she loved my sister.

{"label": true, "txt": "Last week, the newly renovated home-goods floor of the Tiffany & Co. flagship, on Fifth Avenue, was opened to the public. Reimagined by the company\u2019s recently appointed chief creative officer, Reed Krakoff, late of Coach, it now features, in addition to several rooms of glass cases displaying wares, a caf\u00e9\u2014every surface of which is done in the brand\u2019s signature shade of turquoise. The headlines have all been almost exactly the same: \u201cFinally, You Can Have Breakfast at Tiffany.\u201d \u201cHere\u2019s What Having Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s Really Looks Like.\u201d \u201cYou Can Literally Have Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s.\u201d \u201cI Tried to Have Breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s.\u201d They refer, of course, to the opening scene of \u201cBreakfast at Tiffany\u2019s,\u201d the iconic 1961 film adaptation of Truman Capote\u2019s 1958 novella, in which Audrey Hepburn arrives at this very store, the block empty of all other people, at what\u2019s meant to be the crack of dawn after a long night of revelry. Wearing a black ball gown with matching gloves, an elaborate updo, oversized sunglasses, and several lush strands of pearls, she gets out of a cab, carrying a small white paper bag, and walks up to one of the windows displaying jewelry. Barely taking her eyes off the diamonds, she opens the bag and removes a cup of coffee and a pastry, which she bites into, her skeletal jaw working hard as the strings swell on \u201cMoon River,\u201d the movie\u2019s theme song, which was written for Hepburn.\n\nThough her character, Holly Golightly\u2014opaquely drawn as a high-end call girl\u2014is something of a down-on-her-luck striver, an outsider looking in and up, the scene is not about longing or aspiration so much as it is about ritual and the search for simple, almost pastoral pleasures in a dense and hectic city. The street is hers alone; the coffee and pastry are hers alone; the window displays, even, are hers alone. Explaining the store\u2019s draw, later in the film (and, almost word for word, in Capote\u2019s novella), she says that, when she\u2019s feeling awful, \u201cThe only thing that does any good is to jump in a cab and go to Tiffany\u2019s. Calms me down right away. The quietness and the proud look of it. Nothing very bad could happen to you there.\u201d\n\nTimes have changed, to say the least. Tiffany & Co. now shares a block and a wall with Trump Tower, a place where very bad things seem likely to have happened, a place where you may have recently stood in the middle of a surging mass of people chanting \u201cShame! Shame! Shame!\u201d during a political protest. Approaching the store requires maneuvering, at any hour, around large, ugly plastic barriers, and, for a certain kind of person, thinking about the state of the nation. Nonetheless, on Tuesday morning, I, too, tried to have breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s. The first-come-first-serve caf\u00e9 opened last Friday, at 10 A.M., and I\u2019d read that people had waited in line for two hours\u2014which seems insane by most standards but not, sadly, by those of New York restaurant-going, and I\u2019d cleared my morning. Standing on the opposite side of the street, waiting to cross, just after ten, I squinted and looked for a line, outside of either the Fifth Avenue entrance or the Fifty-seventh Street one, but I saw no one. Feeling triumphant\u2014the buzz must have died down quickly, I thought\u2014I marched toward the revolving doors and asked a bright-eyed young uniformed attendant how to get to the caf\u00e9. Bubble, burst: it\u2019s on the fourth floor, he graciously informed me\u2014but entirely booked for most of the day, on account of people showing up at 7 A.M. to start waiting. He suggested returning around three-thirty. \u201cBut you\u2019re welcome to head up there to get more information!\u201d he added.\n\nUpstairs, at the host stand, the prognosis was even worse. Two men of incredible poise, both in suits and one with a posh British accent, told me calmly what they must have told dozens of hopefuls before me: in fact, people had begun to line up at midnight, and coming back at three-thirty was a long shot, but I could try again tomorrow. About a dozen sad-looking young women in black tights and wool jackets stood listlessly against the railing that led to the stairs, peering into the dining room, where other young women were taking DSLR and iPhone photos of \u201cTiffany Tea,\u201d an assortment of finger sandwiches and sweets that arrive on a tiered stand. I asked to see a menu. Breakfast, at Tiffany, is a prix fixe (for twenty-nine dollars) that includes coffee or tea; a croissant with Nutella and honey butter; seasonal fruit; and your choice of a selection of entr\u00e9es ranging from truffled eggs with bacon to buttermilk waffles to, of course, avocado toast. \u201cGood morning, welcome, congratulations, you made it!\u201d I heard a chipper server say as he showed a group of four to their table. \u201cWe love your passion.\u201d\n\nI wasn\u2019t going to have breakfast at Tiffany\u2019s. Instead, I wandered around the home-goods floor, just as Krakoff intended, gazing at artfully arranged crystal decanters and candlesticks. In another scene in the movie, Hepburn brings her love interest\u2014a writer, similarly striving, played by George Peppard\u2014to Tiffany, during business hours. He wants to buy her something; she acquiesces, but only if it costs less than ten dollars, she insists. There\u2019s one item, offers a kindly sales associate: a sterling-silver telephone dialer for $6.75, including tax.\u201cWell, the price is right,\u201d Peppard says. \u201cBut, uh, I must say, I was hoping for something slightly more . . . how shall I say it . . . romantic in feeling.\u201d In the end, they decide to have something engraved: a ring from a box of Cracker Jack.\n\nI imagine they no longer carry a telephone dialer, but Krakoff has more than one-upped it with his new line of \u201cEveryday Objects\u201d: a sterling-silver \u201ctin\u201d can, for a thousand dollars; a sterling-silver ball of yarn, for nine thousand; a pair of coffee cups that look like they\u2019re made of paper but are in fact bone china, and cost ninety-five dollars. Looking around to make sure no one was watching, I tapped a lemon beside a white-and-turquoise teapot to make sure it wasn\u2019t real. A bunch of plastic bananas taunted me from the saddle bag of a turquoise bike. A faux tomato sat beside a sterling-silver plate etched with the image of a sandwich. A handful of dog biscuits were scattered around an engraved water dish\u2014those were real. I thought about how Kate Moss once said, \u201cNothing tastes as good as skinny feels.\u201d And then I rode the elevator back down to the ground floor and crossed Fifth Avenue, in search of a pastry and a cup of coffee."}

{"label": true, "txt": "With new Bachelorette Becca Kufrin waiting in the wings to find her true love, former Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay is out of the spotlight \u2014 that\u2019s probably just how she wants it. She chose Miami-based doctor Bryan Abasolo at the end of her season, and the two walked into the sunset together during the 2017 finale. But, as we know, relationships founded on The Bachelor and The Bachelorette can have, let\u2019s say, short shelf lives. Bachelorette stars Rachel and Bryan still together in 2018?\n\nRachel took to television in 2017 with the dream of finding a man. And she found two! It came down to Bryan and Wisconsin-based personal trainer Peter Kraus. The finale was tough to watch, as Peter and Rachel seemed like a better match to many fans but Peter wasn\u2019t convinced that he could be engaged after knowing someone for, like, six weeks (imagine that). That didn\u2019t fly with Rachel, and the two had a really emotional breakup, one that Rachel thinks overshadowed the fact that she found longtime love with Bryan.\n\n\u201cI wish you were able to really see more of Bryan. [The breakup with Peter] really did overshadow, I felt, a happy moment for us, like one of the best moments of my life,\u201d Rachel told Us Weekly. \u201cI\u2019ve never been engaged before and neither has Bryan, and I felt like we were more on the defense about our relationship and having to explain more of it than rather it just showing \u2026 So I just wish you really got to see Bryan, and I hate that it took away from him.\u201d\n\nAnd, for the record, Peter and Rachel do not talk. \u201cFor me, the reason there was so much emotion [in the finale] was because that was closure for me, that was it,\u201d Rachel told Us Weekly. \u201cAnd I really haven\u2019t talked to him because I don\u2019t have anything else to say. From what I hear, he\u2019s doing well too.\u201d\n\nPeter is doing well, and you know what? Rachel and Bryan are, too! The pair is still together, living in Dallas (Bryan relocated from Miami) and being just a regular, everyday Bachelor Nation couple. (They also still have Copper, Rachel\u2019s dog, which is very important.)\n\nThe number-one question that a Bachelor couple gets after getting engaged on national television is, \u201cWhen are you getting married?\u201d At least Rachel and Bryan have an answer. As Bryan told ExtraTV, \u201cWe haven\u2019t set anything yet. We definitely want to get married this year, and that\u2019s the plan. 2018, it\u2019s gonna happen.\u201d He explained that even though Rachel \u201cisn\u2019t much of a planner,\u201d the nuptials would happen soon, and they may even be on television. \u201cWe would definitely be open to a televised wedding. We, right now, we enjoy showing everybody how in love we are... and I think that would be the culmination of our love story, or the beginning of it,\u201d Bryan said. \u201cI think we would definitely enjoy doing it on national television.\u201d\n\nI would also enjoy have a huge wedding paid for by ABC, so why not? In another interview with Us Weekly, Rachel said she needed a few things of the pair\u2019s impending nuptials. \u201cGood music. I\u2019m very big on \u2018I want everyone to have a good time and enjoy themselves.\u2019 I know it\u2019s like our day, but it\u2019s about the people we love celebrating our day with us,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I really want good flowers. I feel like flowers add character to the wedding, so that\u2019s a must-have. No roses. We\u2019re done. Those days are over.\u201d\n\nNo roses is probably a good idea \u2014 she could go into muscle memory and just start handing them out.

These are all questions that will likely be answered when Netflix\u2019s \u201980s-inspired hit returns in late October (I\u2019m mostly curious about the perm), but you find out the answer to the first question in this new clip, which was released at the U.K.\u2019s MCM Comic-Con.\n\nIntroduced by a p0st-perm Millie Bobby Brown, the new clip from the second season of Stranger Things depicts a confused, pre-perm Eleven as she uses her powers to escape from the Upside Down, which is where she presumably landed after exploding the Demagorgon and saving the town of Hawkins, Indiana, in the season 1 finale.\n\nWatch the New Stranger Things Season 2 Clip\n\nHere we go! @milliebbrown introduces world exclusive, never before seen footage from @Stranger_Things 2! pic.twitter.com/ibaEkLNr9l \u2014 MCM Comic Con (@MCMComicCon) October 16, 2017\n\nAll the elements of the portal between the Upside Down and Hawkins are familiar: the red, glowing light, the placenta-like material of the opening, and the hand reaching out, a shot we\u2019d seen before in the trailers (and now we know the context).\n\nNot to be fixated on the perm\u2026but I\u2019m going to be fixated on the perm. We see that Eleven\u2019s hair is still shorn close to her head when she escapes the Upside Down, so it\u2019s soon after the events of the season 1 finale. Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) mourned Eleven, assuming she had been blown to bits like the Demagorgon, but Sheriff Hopper (David Harbour) seemed to hold out hope that Eleven had lived, leaving her favorite Eggo waffles in the forest.\n\nIn the most recent trailer, we saw Eleven open the box of Eggos, grab them, and run \u2014 so she\u2019s supposedly been living out in the woods for enough time for her to grow her hair and get a perm. (Yes, I realize it\u2019s probably not a perm canonically, that\u2019s just how Eleven\u2019s hair grows. But those are some tight curls!)\n\nHere\u2019s the synopsis of Stranger Things season 2:\n\nStranger Things 2 is set a year after Will\u2019s return, and everything seems back to normal\u2026 but a darkness lurks just beneath the surface, threatening all of Hawkins. It\u2019s 1984 and the citizens of Hawkins, Indiana are still reeling from the horrors of the demagorgon and the secrets of Hawkins Lab. Will Byers has been rescued from the Upside Down but a bigger, sinister entity still threatens those who survived.\n\nSeason 1 cast members Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Finn Wolfhard, Millie Bobby Brown, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, and Joe Keery are all returning for the second season. New cast members include Sean Astin, Paul Reiser and Sadie Sink.\n\nStranger Things season 2 will premiere on Netflix on October 27, 2017."}

Oh, and James and Jax Taylor are actually getting along now too, which is equally blowing our minds.\n\nUnfortunately, there's tension in other relationships, such as with Stassi Schroeder and her now-ex-boyfriend Patrick Meagher, who you can catch a glimpse of in the above supertease. Jax's relationship with girlfriend Brittany Cartwright is rocked after a shocking accusation against the SUR bartender. (By the way, Kristen Doute will be more focused on trying to break Jax and Brittany up rather than on her own relationship with Brian Carter.) There even seems to be trouble in paradise for Tom Sandoval and Ariana Madix.\n\nBut this season will also be about new beginnings. We'll see Lisa Vanderpump move ahead with opening another restaurant with Tom Sandoval and Tom Schwartz, a plan that she proposed to the pair last season. Scheana Marie will begin a new chapter after deciding to end her marriage with Mike Shay last season, allowing her to start up a romance with former flame Rob Valletta.\n\nThere will also be a lot of fun in store for the Vanderpump Rules crew this season, including costume parties, Pride festivities, and an unforgettable return to Mexico.\n\nGet your first look at Season 6 by watching the full supertease, above. Be sure to tune in for the most jaw-dropping season ofVanderpump Rules yet on Monday, December 4 at 9/8c.\n\nCatch up on last season, below."}

But I always kind of knew, like, I wanted to date someone who is just normal and has a normal life. It\u2019s been really good. It\u2019s been really nice. He doesn\u2019t care about any of that stuff.\u201d\n\nThe ABC personality, who \u201chopes\u201d to get married again someday, is hot off the heels of a romantic rendezvous in Hawaii with Jacobs and they have more trips in the works too.\n\nStanton is also spending her summer giving back.

{"label": true, "txt": "This article is about the racing driver. For his father, see Arie Luyendyk\n\nArie Luyendyk Jr. (; Dutch: [\u02c8a\u02d0ri l\u0259j\u025bn\u02c8dik]; born 18 September 1981) is a Dutch-born American auto racing driver and son of two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Arie Luyendyk. He has competed mostly in North America where his father lives and made his career. Luyendyk is best known for competing in the Indy Lights Series where he finished 2nd, 3rd and 4th in the Championship over a number of years. He was named a test-driver in A1 Grand Prix alongside Jeroen Bleekemolen for A1 Team The Netherlands starting the 2007\u201308 season.[2]\n\nLuyendyk has competed in various sports-car series competing in the 12 Hours of Sebring and the 24 Hours of Daytona.\n\nHe was a contestant on ABC's dating competition The Bachelorette season 8 in 2012, where he placed first runner-up, and starred in the 22nd season of its sister show The Bachelor, which premiered on January 1, 2018.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nLuyendyk was born in The Netherlands,[3] to Arie and Mieke Luyendyk.[4] At age 3,[3] he immigrated with his family, including sister Maida, to the United States and settled in Brookfield, Wisconsin. Luyendyk has two younger twin brothers, Alec and Luca.[4]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nLuyendyk began racing karts in 1992, and moved to Sports Car Club of America club Formula Ford competition six years later at the age of 16. He raced in a number of American junior formulae, notching wins in the Skip Barber Formula Dodge series and top five finishes the U.S. Formula Ford 2000 Championship. In 2001, Luyendyk finished third in the Formula Continental class at the SCCA National Championship Runoffs as well as winning the SCCA Southern Pacific divisional title on the strength of four wins in that same class.[citation needed]\n\nHe competed full-time in the first three seasons of the Indy Racing League's Indy Pro Series (now known as Firestone Indy Lights), beginning in 2002. In his Firestone Indy Lights career, Luyendyk has 1 victory, four pole positions and 24 top-5 finishes. Luyendyk finished second in the Firestone Indy Lights Championship in 2002, third in 2004, and fourth in 2008.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2005, Luyendyk attempted to make his IndyCar Series debut by qualifying for the 2005 Indianapolis 500 in a car owned by Curb-Agajanian/Beck Motorsports. However, with limited track time and a car that never handled properly, Luyendyk's qualifying speed of 215.039 mph (346.072 km/h) was close to 2 mph (3.2 km/h) slower than the next slowest qualifier at the time. A. J. Foyt hired driver Felipe Giaffone to qualify a third car for him, and Giaffone's 217.645 mph (350.266 km/h) four-lap average bumped Luyendyk from the field.\n\nLuyendyk did qualify for the 2006 Indianapolis 500 in a car owned by his father and backed by cheapcaribbean.com and Blue Star Jets. The team had limited practice time due to a second week engine program. However, his first race in the more powerful cars ended early due to handling issues, with Luyendyk finishing 54 laps out of 200 and ending in 28th place in the field of 33.[citation needed]\n\nIn the 2007-08 A1 Grand Prix season, Luyendyk drove for A1 Team Netherlands in the A1 Grand Prix World Cup of Motorsport as the team's \"rookie driver\". His best result was a fifth place training time at Round 5 held in Taupo, New Zealand. He has returned to the Firestone Indy Lights Series to race for AGR-AFS Racing as the teammate to Raphael Matos. He captured his first series win in the final race of the 2008 season at Chicagoland Speedway by passing Matos on a late race restart. Luyendyk would finish the 2008 season fourth in the Championship, recording five podium finishes.[citation needed]\n\nIn 2010, he returned part-time to Indy Lights and drove in the Freedom 100 for Andersen Racing and three other oval races for Alliance Motorsports. His best finish was seventh at Chicagoland.[citation needed]\n\nPro Light TORC truck at Crandon\n\nIn 2013, Luyendyk made the switch to off-road racing in the Stadium Super Trucks series,[5] finishing seventh in points. In his partial season Luyendyk notched a heat win and three 4th-place finishes in seven starts.\n\nLuyendyk finished the season driving in the Traxxas TORC Series with Aero Motorsports backed by Ethika and Cooper Tires. In Luyendyk's TORC debut he finished fourth at Crandon International Off-Road Raceway driving in the Pro Light class. On November 18, 2013, Luyendyk completed a test with Dale Coyne Racing in the DW12 IndyCar. Luyendyk ran 138 laps.[citation needed]\n\nTelevision [ edit ]\n\nIn 2009, Luyendyk became the driver analyst for Versus broadcasts of Indy Lights races. In 2012 Luyendyk returned to the booth, commentating the Indy Lights races for the NBC Sports Network. He appeared as himself in season nine of Hell's Kitchen. The chefs visited the Grand Prix of Long Beach in which Luyendyk was participating.[citation needed]\n\nLuyendyk placed second on the eighth season of the reality show The Bachelorette, starring Emily Maynard.\n\nLuyendyk appeared in the first episode of the 17th season of The Bachelor. Luyendyk also competed on Wipeout: Summer Episode 7: \"Bachelors vs. Bachelorettes\", where he was eliminated early.\n\nIn 2017, it was announced that Luyendyk would appear in the 22nd season of The Bachelor. He asked Rebecca \"Becca\" Kufrin to marry him at the season finale however he later regretted rejecting Lauren Burnham, the runner-up, and tried to rekindle things with Burnham.[6] Luyendyk and Burnham are engaged as of March 6, 2018.[7]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nLuyendyk currently works as a real estate broker for RE/MAX in Scottsdale, Arizona.[8] He is engaged to the runner-up, Lauren Burnham of The Bachelor[7] with a wedding planned for January 12, 2019.[9] Burnham has moved to Scottsdale to be with Luyendyk.[10]\n\nRacing record [ edit ]\n\nSCCA National Championship Runoffs [ edit ]\n\nYear Track Car Engine Class Finish Start Status 2000 Mid-Ohio Van Diemen RF01 Ford Formula Continental 3 2 Running\n\nAmerican open-wheel racing [ edit ]\n\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position)\n\nIndy Lights [ edit ]\n\nIndyCar [ edit ]\n\nYear Team 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Rank Points 2005 CURB/Agajanian/Beck Motorsports HMS PHX STP MOT INDY\n\nDNQ TXS RIR KAN NSH MIL MIS KTY PPIR SNM CHI WGL FON NC \u2013 2006 Luyendyk Racing HMS STP MOT INDY\n\n28 WGL TXS RIR KAN NSH MIL MIS KTY SNM CHI 36th 10\n\nIndianapolis 500 [ edit ]\n\nYear Chassis Engine Start Finish Team 2005 Dallara Chevrolet DNQ Beck 2006 Panoz Honda 31 28 Luyendyk\n\nComplete A1 Grand Prix results [ edit ]\n\n(key) (Races in bold indicate pole position) (Races in italics indicate fastest lap)"}

{"label": true, "txt": "There is a snowman\u2019s chance in hell that Disney will give Elsa a girlfriend in Frozen 2.\n\nAnd yet, thanks to a vague new comment from Frozen 2 co-director Jennifer Lee, LGBT Disney fans are probably going to get their hopes up once again, only to watch them melt.\n\n\u201cI love everything that people are saying [and] people are thinking about with our film\u2014that it\u2019s creating dialogue, that Elsa is this wonderful character that speaks to so many people,\u201d Lee told HuffPost in a recent interview, when asked about the prospect of Elsa getting a girlfriend. \u201cIt means the world to us that we\u2019re part of these conversations.\u201d\n\nLee followed up that response with a lengthy comment that barely amounts to a \u201cmaybe\u201d when read carefully: \u201cWhere we\u2019re going with it, we have tons of conversations about it, and we\u2019re really conscientious about these things. For me\u2026Elsa\u2019s every day telling me where she needs to go, and she\u2019ll continue to tell us. I always write from character-out, and where Elsa is and what Elsa\u2019s doing in her life, she\u2019s telling me every day. We\u2019ll see where we go.\u201d\n\nHuffPost correctly labeled that noncommittal response a \u201cglimmer of hope\u201d for the #GiveElsaAGirlfriend campaign, which sprouted up on social media in 2016. Others have been more generous in their assessment: \u201cRing The Alarm!\u201d BuzzFeed declared. \u201cElsa Might Have A Girlfriend In The \u2018Frozen\u2019 Sequel.\u201d But it\u2019s safe to say that we can un-ring that bell. If you think there\u2019s a serious chance Elsa will find same-sex love in Arendelle, it\u2019s probably best to let that hope go. Disney has been down this road before.\n\n\u201c For the last few years now, Disney has walked a delicate tightrope between not shutting down LGBT fans who want to see better representation in their films and not pissing off homophobic viewers. \u201d\n\nRemember when eagle-eyed fans spotted a lesbian-looking couple in the Finding Dory trailer, creating mounting speculation that we\u2019d see definitively LGBT representation in a Pixar movie, only for the film\u2019s co-director to give the cop-out answer, \u201cThey can be whatever you want them to be?\u201d\n\nOr when the director of the live-action Beauty and the Beast remake promised an \u201cexclusively gay moment,\u201d angering social conservatives, only for Gaston\u2019s sidekick LeFou to be briefly spotted dancing with another man in the film\u2019s finale? (As my Daily Beast colleague Kevin Fallon wrote, \u201cTruth be told, the most exclusively gay moment in this new Beauty and the Beast is my dramatic eye roll after seeing the actual thing.\u201d)\n\nDisney\u2019s biggest PG-13 property has disappointed LGBT fans as well.\n\nIn 2016, director J.J. Abrams told The Daily Beast that he \u201cwould love it\u201d if there were a gay character in Star Wars and that \u201cit seems insanely narrow-minded and counterintuitive to say that there wouldn\u2019t be a homosexual character in that world.\u201d Yet there are still no confirmed gay people to be found in the new films\u2014despite some fans\u2019 rigorous shipping of Finn and Poe. (And now that yet another Star Wars trilogy has been announced, there will be three more opportunities to depict a galaxy far, far away where, apparently, gay people either do not exist or live in hiding.)\n\nFor the last few years now, Disney has walked a delicate tightrope between not shutting down LGBT fans who want to see better representation in their films and not pissing off homophobic viewers. There\u2019s no reason to expect them to stop toeing that line until it\u2019s safe for the film giant to throw their full weight behind the LGBT community.\n\nAs the LGBT media advocacy group GLAAD noted in 2017, Walt Disney Studios \u201chas the weakest historical record when it comes to LGBTQ-inclusive films\u201d out of all the big studios. Disney\u2019s got a family-friendly reputation to protect, and at a time when many Americans still think that children need to be protected from LGBT \u201ccorruption\u201d\u201437 percent of respondents to one recent GLAAD survey, for example, said they would be uncomfortable with their child learning about LGBT history in school\u2014a lesbian or bisexual Snow Queen is probably perceived as an unnecessary financial risk.\n\nAccording to Fast Company writer Joe Berkowitz, the \u201cmost family-friendly studio on the planet would be inviting a boycott\u201d if they gave Elsa a girlfriend\u2014so why sell fewer tickets to a guaranteed smash hit when you can sell more?\n\nAnd when Disney already caused an uproar among anti-LGBT evangelicals five years ago with Elsa\u2019s nonspecific, feel-good song lyrics about \u201clet[ting] it go\u201d and \u201cbreak[ing] through,\u201d why would they double down this time around when they are sure to be under scrutiny?\n\nThe parallel isn\u2019t perfect, of course, but I always think about the interracial couple in The Princess and the Frog whenever LGBT fans seem to think the moment for a queer Disney character has finally arrived. According to Gallup polling data, a majority of Americans have approved of marriage between black people and white people since 1997, and over 75 percent have approved since 2004, but Disney still waited until 2009, when support was over 80 percent, to tell the story of Tiana and her prince. That\u2019s the definition of playing it safe.\n\nSo, if we speculate that Disney would wait to include an LGBT main character in an animated film until they only risked angering fewer than 20 percent of American viewers, then we\u2019ve still got a ways to go yet. As of 2017, according to Gallup, only 64 percent of Americans now support same-sex marriage, up from 42 percent in 2004. If approval continues to climb at that exact same rate, it will hit the 80 percent mark in\u202617 years\u2014probably about the same time that Frozen 7: Olaf\u2019s Revenge comes out.\n\nIt would be nice if Disney, like Elsa, could proclaim, \u201cLet the storm rage on\u201d and march forward. But if history is any indication, Frozen 2 will almost certainly give hopeful LGBT fans the cold shoulder."}

{"label": true, "txt": "In the second half of Bachelor In Paradise\u2019s two-night premiere, the BIP cast addressed the sexual encounter that occurred between DeMario Jackson and Corinne Olympios, which suspended the show\u2019s production and led to an internal investigation following \u201callegations of misconduct.\u201d\n\nThe cast\u2019s sit down came just days after the show was given the green light to resume filming after Warner\u2019s Bro.\u2019s investigation concluded no misconduct had occurred.\n\n\u201cBefore I can officially declare Paradise back open, I think it\u2019s very important that we sit down and have a serious talk, all of us, about what happened, what didn\u2019t happen, and what we all need to do to start this show together,\u201d host Chris Harrison began the group discussion.\n\nWarner Bros. hired an outside firm to \u201clook into everything that supposedly happened\u201d and \u201cthey concluded that there was no evidence of misconduct by cast on the set,\u201d he continued. \u201cDo you trust that conclusion?\u201d\n\nThe contestants then unanimously agreed and the conversation turned to their support for not only Corinne and DeMario, but also the show\u2019s producers and staff.\n\n\u201cI was confident that nothing happened between DeMario and Corinne that was bad,\u201d said Raven Gates. \u201cI trusted everyone that worked here, so I knew everything was going to be okay.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there was a lot in the media regarding the producers as if they\u2019re not our friends and they\u2019re just using us to make us do things like we\u2019re going to just do whatever they say,\u201d Alex Woytkiw added.\n\nDerek Peth then jumped in saying, \u201cI think there\u2019s a weird perception that exists out there that we\u2019re not in control of ourselves when we\u2019re here. \u2026 We all know how realistic the friendships are with and among the cast. \u2026 We are here to make our own decisions and develop real relationships with everybody.\u201d\n\nThe cast then discussed how they believed race played a role in how the situation was handled.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sensitive to it because I\u2019m from the South and we have a stigma that seeing a white woman with a black man is wrong,\u201d Raven said. \u201cAnd that night, what happened wasn\u2019t wrong. And so I was super empathetic with DeMario because it\u2019s just another issue. Not only is consent important, but it\u2019s also to get rid of the stigma that interracial couples can\u2019t be or blaming African American men for crimes they didn\u2019t commit.\u201d\n\nJasmine Goode then added that she was thinking about the long-term repercussions for DeMario even after he was cleared of any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cI was just thinking the whole time: what if this happened to my brother?\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s a great guy from the guy I met here \u2026 and I never felt he was aggressive with any of us. \u2026 I just hate that he\u2019s going to have this image stuck with him for a while.\u201d\n\nThe group also discussed consent and slut shaming, with Chris leading the conversation as he asked the cast to define consent before telling everything to \u201ckeep consent in mind,\u201d especially while in Paradise and \u201cfor forever.\u201d\n\nChris then asked the group if they wanted to be there and if they agreed with the show resuming filming following the incident.\n\n\u201cKnowing what we all know now, having lived through what we\u2019ve all lived through and experienced \u2014 the shutdown, the scandal, the accusations, everything we\u2019ve all endured \u2014 do each of you want to be here?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cIf the majority of you feels like we should not continue, then we will not continue the show. Please be 100 percent honest because it\u2019s important that we get this right.

{"label": true, "txt": "Following the leak of a sex tape allegedly featuring Blac Chyna and an unknown man, the reality star's lawyers are speaking out against the release of the tape, calling it \"revenge porn.\"\n\nChyna's attorney, Walter Mosley, tells ET that the minute-long clip, leaked on Monday, is \"a matter for the police to investigate\" and that he and Chyna are \"taking that course of action.\"\n\n\"We\u2019re going to turn over all of our leaks to the authorities and let them pursue the matter the best way that they\u2019ve been trained to do,\" Mosley said.\n\nMosley has also been sending cease and desist letters to various websites hosting the video, and many have subsequently removed the video. Additionally, the Twitter account that originally posted the clip has been removed.\n\nOn Monday, Mosley took to Instagram to share a statement condemning the prevalence of sex tape leaks and the culture that he feels excuses it.\n\n\"We have to change this culture of abuse and assault against women. Today\u2019s post saddens me deeply as it is an attack not only against my client but my friend,\" Mosley wrote. \"Why do we think it\u2019s acceptable to sell, or publish, or seek revenge, or blackmail women in this way and without their consent? It\u2019s not.\"\n\nThe high-profile attorney then implored men to \"do better.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m tired of telling my clients to not make videos because the men will put them out later.

We need to stop sharing these videos with each other in the club, at the barbershop or (and especially) online.\"\n\nMosely concluded by calling it a \"morally corrupt action,\" one that is criminal in the state of California.\n\n\"Maybe it is time to set an example,\" he wrote.\n\nAttorney Lisa Bloom, who represented Chyna during her lawsuit against her ex-fiance, Rob Kardashian, last year, took to Twitter to explain the dangers of illegally posting sex tapes.\n\n\"Revenge porn -- posting explicit images without the consent of everyone in those images -- is a crime, a civil wrong, and a form of domestic abuse,\" Bloom wrote, without referring to Chyna by name in her posts. \"It's also a way to try to slut shame women for being sexual.

It premiered on September 5, 2017, and concluded on November 14, 2017. The series was renewed on October 4, 2016. The subtitle Cult was announced on July 20, 2017. This season takes place in the fictional suburb of Brookfield Heights, Michigan, during the year 2017, and centers on a cult terrorizing the residents in the aftermath of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nReturning cast members from previous seasons include Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters, Cheyenne Jackson, John Carroll Lynch, Chaz Bono, Adina Porter, James Morosini, Emma Roberts, Mare Winningham, Frances Conroy, and Jamie Brewer, along with new cast members Billie Lourd and Alison Pill. Cult marks the first season to not feature series mainstay actress Lily Rabe.\n\nCult received mostly positive reviews from critics. Paulson, Peters and Porter, all received Saturn Awards nominations for their performances. Additionally, Paulson and Porter were nominated for Outstanding Lead Actress and Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie respectively at the 64th Primetime Emmy Awards while Peters received a nomination for Best Actor in a Movie or Limited Series at the 8th Critics' Choice TV Awards.\n\nPlot [ edit ]\n\nThe fictional city of Brookfield Heights, Michigan is left divided by the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Local restaurant owner Ally Mayfair-Richards (Sarah Paulson) is utterly distraught by Donald Trump's victory and several of her longstanding phobias, including coulrophobia, hemophobia, and trypophobia, flare up as a result. Similarly devastated is fellow Brookfield Heights resident Winter Anderson (Billie Lourd), a liberal college dropout. Contrarily, Kai Anderson (Evan Peters), Winter's estranged and manipulative brother, rejoices at the election results and is enticed to pursue political power. Kai recruits a disillusioned Winter and frustrated newscast reporter Beverly Hope (Adina Porter).\n\nAlly finds herself relentlessly terrorized by masked clowns. Those close to her, including her psychiatrist Dr. Rudy Vincent (Cheyenne Jackson), question whether the attacks are real or merely anxiety-fueled hallucinations. Ally's paranoia, escalated by suspicious activities perpetrated by new neighbors Harrison (Billy Eichner) and Meadow Wilton (Leslie Grossman), hinders her relationships with her wife Ivy (Alison Pill) and their son Oz (Cooper Dodson).\n\nCast and characters [ edit ]\n\nMain [ edit ]\n\nRecurring [ edit ]\n\nGuest stars [ edit ]\n\nEpisodes [ edit ]\n\nProduction [ edit ]\n\nDevelopment [ edit ]\n\nOn October 4, 2016, the series was renewed for a seventh cycle, which premiered on September 5, 2017.[12][13][14] Ryan Murphy confirmed that the season will be connected to Freak Show, but will be set in modern day.[15] In February 2017, on Watch What Happens Live, Murphy announced that the season would revolve around the 2016 U.S. election and suggested that it may feature a character based on President Donald Trump.[16] Murphy has said that the season will be representative of both sides of the political divide. He also said that he will be \"illuminating and highlighting\" groups of people he believes to be \"ignored by the current [Trump] administration and who are afraid and feel terrorized that their lives are going to be taken away.\"[17]\n\nIt was later confirmed that the season would be set in the aftermath of the presidential election, with the first episode taking place on election night.[18][19] Murphy explained it will be about \"the fallout of that night, which to many people, from all sides of the camps is a horror story.\"[20] He also revealed the season would not feature Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton, stating \"Horror Story is always about allegory, so the election is allegory.\"[20] In April 2017, Murphy confirmed that archive footage of the election night would be used in the season premiere.[21]\n\nMurphy revealed via Twitter that the details of the seventh season, including the title, would be revealed on July 20.[22] He also teased that the opening sequence of the series would return in this season, following its absence in Roanoke.[23]\n\nOn July 20, 2017, it was announced at the San Diego Comic-Con that the title of the season would be Cult. Murphy also revealed it would be set in Michigan, and confirmed it would consist of a total of 11 episodes, premiering on September 5, 2017. For the first time, the series did not air on Wednesdays but rather on Tuesdays. On August 3, 2017, online posters revealed the names of multiple characters of the season.[24] On August 21, 2017, the opening title sequence of the season was revealed, following its absence in the previous season.[25] That same month, Murphy confirmed that, contrary to the past seasons, Cult would not feature supernatural elements.[26]\n\nCasting [ edit ]\n\nDuring the Winter 2017 TCA Press Tour, series mainstays Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters were reported to be starring as the leads in the season.[15][14] In March 2017, Billy on the Street host Billy Eichner was announced to be cast in the series, playing a role in the life of Paulson's character.[19][27] His character is slated for appearing in \"six or seven\" episodes.[19] The next month, it was reported that Scream Queens alum Billie Lourd will also star in the seventh installment of the series.[18][20] In May 2017, Leslie Grossman, who starred in Murphy's series Popular, joined the cast of the series,[28] and Angela Bassett hinted she may return in a recurring role.[29] Despite this, Bassett didn't appear. Later that month, it was confirmed via set pictures that Adina Porter and Cheyenne Jackson were also returning.[30][31] In June 2017, Murphy confirmed via his Instagram account that Colton Haynes, whom Murphy worked with previously on second season of Scream Queens, was joining the casting for the seventh season.[32] Later that month, set pictures revealed that Alison Pill was joining the cast of the season, seemingly portraying the partner of Sarah Paulson's character.[33] In July 2017, Murphy revealed via his Twitter account that Lena Dunham was joining the season.[34] She is set to play Valerie Solanas, author of the SCUM Manifesto and attempted murder of Andy Warhol, via flashbacks.[35] Murphy also confirmed the returns of Frances Conroy and Mare Winningham. Conroy has appeared in all the seasons except Hotel, while Winningham has appeared in Coven, Freak Show and Hotel.[36] In August 2017, Murphy confirmed the return of Emma Roberts, who appeared in Coven and Freak Show,[37] while Roanoke actors Chaz Bono and James Morosini also confirmed their returns.[38] In the seventh episode, Murder House, Coven and Freak Show actress alum Jamie Brewer returned to the show.\n\nOn June 26, 2017, it was confirmed that Lady Gaga would not return for the seventh season due to other projects.[39] Despite rumors, Entertainment Weekly reported on July 7, 2017, that Vera Farmiga, sister of American Horror Story alum Taissa Farmiga, would not appear in the season.[40] Later that month, it was confirmed by The Hollywood Reporter that Kathy Bates will not appear in Cult, after four seasons of regular appearances.[41]\n\nMurphy also revealed via his Instagram account that Freak Show character Twisty the Clown would return in the seventh season, indicating that John Carroll Lynch would reprise his role.[42]\n\nFilming [ edit ]\n\nIn February 2017, it was announced the season would begin principal photography in June 2017.[16] By the next month, filming was moved to May 2017.[19] On May 24, 2017, writer and producer John J. Gray confirmed the show started filming.[43]\n\nEdits [ edit ]\n\nOn October 7, 2017, it was confirmed that the sixth episode of the season would be edited as a direct result of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting that occurred on October 1, 2017. The episode originally featured a scene lasting 2 minutes and 16 seconds where Leslie Grossman's character Meadow Wilton begins to fire at Evan Peters' character, as well as a crowd, during a campaign speech. The episode was edited to de-emphasize the violence and to mostly have it featured completely off-screen[44] - as a result the opening sequence of the episode was cut in half, several on-screen deaths were removed and two separate close-up shots of the handgun firing were removed.[45]\n\nWhile only the edited episode was broadcast on FX, the original uncut episode was released via VOD, FXNOW and FX+.[45]\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nCritical response [ edit ]\n\nAmerican Horror Story: Cult received mostly positive reviews from critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the season a 73% approval rating, with an average rating of 7.05/10, based on 47 reviews. The site's consensus reads, \"American Horror Story: Cult intrigues with timely, over-the-top creepiness - and lots of clowns - despite being hampered by broad political generalizations and occasional holes in the narrative's logic.\"[46] On Metacritic, the season was given a score of 66 out of 100 based on 24 reviews, indicating \"generally positive reviews\".[47]\n\nAmerican Horror Story (season 7): Critical reception by episode Season 7 (2017) : Percentage of positive reviews tracked by the website Rotten Tomatoes[48]\n\nAwards and nominations [ edit ]\n\nIn its seventh season, the series has been nominated for 22 awards, 3 of them were won.\n\nRatings [ edit ]\n\nAmerican Horror Story : U.S. viewers per episode (millions) Audience measurement performed by Nielsen Media Research.

The network and studio announced the news shortly after creator and star Jerrod Carmichael revealed he was exiting the series as cast options were set to expire at the end of today.\n\nThe Carmichael Show, from 20th TV, which is the leading studio, and Universal TV, scored a dramatic eleventh-hour renewal last year, with a deal coming after NBC had announced its fall schedule and its executives had faced questions about the show\u2019s uncertain future in light of its acclaim.\n\nCarmichael released a statement to Deadline today through his publicist.\n\n\u201cFor three seasons (okay 2.5), I got to make a show that I love with my friends,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve wanted to do since I was 13. Now, I\u2019m excited to go make other things that I love. Thank you to every person who worked on or watched The Carmichael Show.\u201c\n\nJust like last May, we heard renewal negotiation between NBC and 20th TV had been difficult, with the two sides far apart and talks going slowly. With no clear indications from the network one way or the other, I hear 20th TV quietly sent out feelers to other networks to gauge potential interest in case NBC opted to cancel the show.\n\n\u201cThe Carmichael Show was such a wonderful show that we choose to focus today not on its loss but on the three incredible seasons we had the pleasure to produce,\u201d said 20th Century Fox TV Presidents Jonnie Davis and Howard Kurtzman today in a statement. \u201cWe are thankful to the brilliant Jerrod Carmichael and his talented cast, and to showrunner Danielle Sanchez-Witzell, our fantastic writers and devoted production team. It\u2019s a rarity that a comedy series tackles the social and political issues of the day in such a clever and hilariously funny way. This show was special, and we will miss it.\u201d\n\nSaid NBC Entertainment Chairman Bob Greenblatt and President Jennifer Salke: \u201cWe are enormously proud of The Carmichael Show and Jerrod\u2019s talent and vision to do a classic family sitcom that also taps into issues and relevant stories from the real world. We thank and salute the cast, crew, and producers \u2014 and especially Jerrod \u2014 for three critically acclaimed seasons.\u201d\n\nSeason 3 of The Carmichael Show \u2014 a rare critically praised multi-camera sitcom \u2014 was produced for this midseason but was held until May 31. There had been concerns the delay would chip away at the show\u2019s timeliness, which had been part of its DNA as the show had regularly taken on hot-button subjects like police violence.\n\nNBC\n\nBut Season 3 has proven very timely \u2014 two weeks ago NBC postponed at the last minute an episode that deals with a mass shooting as it fell on a day of two real-life mass shootings in the U.S. \u2014 including the one at a congressional GOP baseball practice. The network\u2019s decision was publicly criticized by Carmichael who called it \u201ccriminal.\u201d That episode aired last night.\n\nLast week, The Carmichael Show tackled the N-word and whether white people can say it on the heels of the controversy surrounding comedian Bill Maher\u2019s use of the word on his HBO show.\n\nRatings-wise, The Carmichael Show has been relatively stable. Airing on Wednesdays behind Little Big Shots and its offshoot Little Big Shots: Forever Young, the comedy\u2019s adults 18-49 ratings have stayed within the 0.7-0.9 in Live+Same Day."}

While the stunt seemed silly at first, it turned out there was a meaningful reason behind it all.\n\nJoseph recounted how, years before they \"were able to make any money playing music,\" he invited Dun over to his house to watch the GRAMMYs, and \"as we were watching, we noticed that every single one of us was in our underwear.

For example, she seemingly confirmed that she had indeed tied the knot with her longtime boyfriend while opening up about being a mom, when she referred to Simon Konecki as her \"husband.\" However, her best moment might have come when she openly wept and said that, while she appreciated the honor, she felt wrong winning it over Beyonce.\n\n\"I can't possibly accept this award. I'm very humbled and very grateful and gracious but [the] artist of my life is Beyonce,\" Adele said through tears as Beyonce looked up at her from the audience. \"The Lemonade album is just so monumental and so well thought out and so beautiful.

From out-of-place crowd surfing to lead singer James Hetfield's mic getting accidentally turned off, the whole thing just fell apart on its feet in slow motion.\n\n\n\nAdele Makes Herself Cry\n\n\n\nWe never like to see Adele sad! While she might have been flawless in her opening number, when it came time to sing a tribute to the late George Michael, she had a bit of a vocal mishap that led to her getting very emotional.\n\nWhile performing Michael's 1996 song, \"Fastlove,\" a clearly upset Adele stopped the song and said, \"I know it's live TV. I f**ked up. I can't do it again like last year. I'm sorry for swearing. Can we please start it again? I'm sorry, I can't mess this up for him.\" After the second time around, the singer appeared to be on the verge of tears, despite a stirring performance and a lot of support from the audience.\n\n\n\nGreg Kurstin Gets Cut Off\n\n\n\nMusical artists often have to contend with the \"wrap it up\" music when their acceptance speeches go long, but rarely do you see their mics cut off entirely. When Adele and producer Greg Kurstin won the GRAMMY for Song of the Year, Adele got to thank fans, but when Kurstin took the mic, the show producers could not care less and cut away without letting him talk at all. The move elicited a chorus of boos from the audience and was yet another tech hiccup. Luckily, Adele ended up correcting the show's mistake by letting Kurstin talk first when they won Record of the Year.\n\n\n\nJames Corden Trolls Fans Over Kanye West's Boycott\n\n\n\nKanye West was very adamant about not showing up to the GRAMMYs this year. So, when Corden came out to seemingly introduce a performance by the Life of Pablo artist, a lot of fans and viewers freaked out! Then, it turned out Corden was trolling us entirely and the whole thing was just a set-up to the invariably dry annual speech by Recording Academy President Neil Portnow. It was a letdown, to say the least.\n\n\n\nNEWS: Chance the Rapper Was Everyone's Best Friend at the 2017 GRAMMYs -- See the Pics!\n\n\n\n\n\nWEIRDEST MOMENTS\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Corden's Disastrous Intro\n\n\n\nIn what was supposed to be a joke mocking the recent spate of tech problems at various awards shows, Corden's introduction was filled with (intentionally) broken lifts, pratfalls and various mishaps. While it was very funny at the time, it turned out to be a good predictor of the multitude of technical issues that plagued the rest of the show.\n\n\n\nEverything With John Travolta\n\n\n\nThe Saturday Night Fever star came out to promote the fact that there was going to be a Bee Gees tribute later in the show. While that alone was sort of weird, what made things truly bizarre was his unexplained \"bling\" and his unprompted confession that he can't read without glasses. This appearance will never make sense.\n\n\n\nDemi Lovato Singing Bee Gees Tunes\n\n\n\nIn a tribute to the iconic Bee Gees, the \"Confident\" singer wore a disco-tastic dress and sang \"Stayin' Alive.\" (Or, more specifically, only portions of the '70s classic.) While the tribute -- which also included Tori Kelly, Andra Day and LIttle Big Town -- on the whole wasn't bad, it just felt a little disjointed overall.\n\n\n\nSee even more of the best and weirdest moments from the GRAMMYs and the red carpet over at Giphy, ET's partner in bringing all the unforgettable moments to life!\n\n\n\n\n\nWATCH: Beyonc\u00e9's GRAMMYs 2017 Performance Features Blue Ivy, Her Baby Bump and Pregnant Dancing\n\n\n\nRelated Gallery"}
{"label": true, "txt": "You\u2019ve probably been looking for a way to whiten your smile for years now. You\u2019ve tried special toothpastes, whitening gums, whitening strips, using mouthwash, and even brushing with baking soda every now and again. With the exception of taking a trip down to your dentist\u2019s office and demanding a pricey whitening treatment, you\u2019ve basically tried it all. Everything except turmeric.\n\nIn a recent interview with E! News, 29-year-old actress Julianne Hough admitted that turmeric is to thank for her unforgettably white smile.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d think it would be the opposite and it\u2019d stain your teeth, but it actually makes them whiter,\u201d she said, \u201cTurmeric is the bomb. Y\u2019all should try it.\u201d\n\nTurmeric is most commonly known as the kitchen spice that gives curry its signature colour, but despite its orange-yellow tint, turmeric is a spice that is valued in and outside of the kitchen in many areas of the world.\n\nHealth-wise, what makes the spice so beneficial is curcumin, a natural antibiotic, antiseptic and anti-inflammatory found in turmeric that helps to repair damage and clear away bacteria. Turmeric also contains natural brightening properties, which in theory makes it the perfect natural teeth whitener and gum cleanser.\n\nTEETH WHITENING: Coconut Oil & Turmeric. Brush teeth w/mixture for 2 minutes & rinse w/sea salt water. VOIL\u00c1! pic.twitter.com/oRXYKRizBx \u2014 RuPaul (@RuPaul) August 20, 2016\n\nAll of the scientific words behind turmeric and teeth whitening sounds great, but does it actually work in practice? The jury is divided on this one. According to many social media beauty gurus like Farah Dhukai and bloggers like Aliee Chan, it totally does! Though it is worth noting that some doctors like Shereene Idriss, M.D., advise that while turmeric may have the potential of whitening your smile overtime, you could also be at risk of staining your teeth if you don\u2019t rinse your mouth thoroughly enough. And you should be mindful that turmeric does not have the same effect on your sink and toothbrush as it does on your teeth\u2013so proceed on your journey to whiter teeth with caution!\n\nIf you\u2019re apprehensive to the idea of using turmeric as a teeth whitener, you\u2019ll be happy to know that turmeric\u2019s superpowers don\u2019t just stop there. Its lightening properties and fine texture make for a cleansing and exfoliating mask great for targeting dark spots and acne. Turmeric has also been linked to improved brain health, weight loss and more. Does it actually work? Well, at the very least, it won\u2019t hurt your wallet to try."}

Nicole's ex-husband, O. J. Simpson, was acquitted of their murders in 1995, but found liable for both deaths in a 1997 civil suit.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nGoldman was born on July 2, 1968. He grew up in the community of Buffalo Grove, Illinois, near Chicago. His parents divorced in 1974 when he was six and, after spending a brief time in the custody of his mother, Sharon (Fohrman) Rufo, he was raised by his father, Fred Goldman, and lived with him and his younger sister, Kim Goldman.[2][3]\n\nGoldman grew up Jewish.[4][5] He attended high school at Adlai E. Stevenson High School in Lincolnshire, Illinois. He was a student at Illinois State University for one semester (where he planned to major in psychology) and a pledge to Sigma Nu fraternity before he followed his family to southern California at age 18.[6]\n\nWhen younger, Goldman had worked as a camp counselor and had volunteered to help disabled children.[7][8]\n\nIn California [ edit ]\n\nWhile living in Los Angeles, Goldman took some classes at Pierce College.[7] He learned to surf and enjoyed playing beach volleyball, rollerblading, nightclubbing,[9] and working out.\n\nUpon arriving in California, he lived independently from his family and supported himself by working as an employment headhunter and tennis instructor. He then worked a string of waiter jobs.[7] He also occasionally did work as a model for Barry Zeldes, owner of Z90049 (the store next to the California Pizza Kitchen in Brentwood Gardens, where he had worked before Mezzaluna).[6] Not long before his death, he had earned an Emergency Medical Technician's license but decided not to pursue that career.[7]\n\nInstead, Goldman told friends that he wanted to open a bar or restaurant in the Brentwood area.[7] He had shared with friends his vision of opening a future restaurant or bar characterized not by a name, but by the ankh, an Egyptian religious symbol of life that matched the tattoo on his shoulder.[6] According to his friend, Jeff Keller, he wanted to learn all facets of the restaurant-bar business, and occasionally worked as a promoter[6] at a Century City dance club called Tripps.[7] For Memorial Day, he participated with a group of event promoters in organizing a party at Renaissance, a club and restaurant on the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica.[6]\n\nGoldman had also expressed aspirations to act and to be on a show, and he appeared as a contestant on the short-lived game show Studs in 1992.[10]\n\nFriendship with Nicole Brown [ edit ]\n\nAccording to a June 15, 1994 Los Angeles Times article published three days after his death, Goldman probably met Brown six weeks before they were killed, when he borrowed her Ferrari. They grew increasingly close, accompanying each other to dance clubs, and meeting for coffee and dinner during the month-and-a-half before they died. According to police and friends, their relationship was platonic. According to the article, he had borrowed her car when he met his friend, Craig Clark, for lunch. According to Clark, he told him it was her car, but that he did not say she was his girlfriend. \"He said they were friends.\"[11]\n\nDeath [ edit ]\n\nOn the evening of Sunday, June 12, 1994, Goldman was a waiter at Mezzaluna Trattoria, a restaurant located at 11750 San Vicente Boulevard in Brentwood. Brown had called there to report that her mother, Juditha Brown, had accidentally left her sunglasses on the table.[11] After a quick search, they were discovered in the gutter outside the restaurant. Although he had not served her table, he agreed to take them to her home after work.\n\nBefore returning the sun glasses, Goldman stopped at his apartment, located at 11663 Gorham Avenue in Brentwood. He had after-work plans with his friend, Stewart Tanner, Mezzaluna's bartender, who said: \"He was going to go home and change and then we were going to go out.\" The Los Angeles Times reports, \"Goldman punched out at 9:33 pm and stayed another 15 minutes to have a bottled water at the bar. Then he left, still in his uniform, black pants and white shirt, his tie shed. He carried the glasses that Brown wanted to be returned to her. 'I'll see you later,' he called to Tanner as he walked out.\"[6]\n\nWhen Goldman arrived at Brown's residence, at 875 South Bundy Drive, he was stabbed to death along with her, on the walkway leading to the condominium. He was just a few weeks shy of his 26th birthday.[6] During a reconstruction of the events, the police came to believe he had arrived during or shortly after Nicole's death.[citation needed]\n\nHis body, along with Brown's, was found shortly after midnight, when police arrived at the crime scene.\n\nGoldman is buried at Pierce Brothers Valley Oaks Memorial Park in Westlake Village, California.[12]\n\nTrials and aftermath [ edit ]\n\nSimpson was tried for the murders of both Brown and Goldman. In October 1995, after a public trial that lasted nearly nine months, he was acquitted. In a 1997 civil trial, a jury found him liable for the wrongful death of Goldman and awarded $19.5 million in damages to his family. Simpson was subsequently jailed for an unrelated armed robbery at a Las Vegas hotel in 2008.[13][14]\n\nThe rights to Simpson's book, If I Did It, a first-person account of how he would have committed the murders had he committed them, were awarded to the Goldman family in August 2007. They were granted the proceeds from the book in 2007 as part of the $33.5 million civil jury award against him they had been trying to collect for over a decade. They own the copyright, media rights, and movie rights.[15]\n\nThey also acquired Simpson's name, likeness, life story, and right of publicity in connection with the book, according to court documents, ensuring he would not be able to profit from the book. After renaming the book If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer, the Goldman family published it in September 2007 through Beaufort Books.[16]\n\nFoundation [ edit ]\n\nThe Goldman family contributed a portion of proceeds from the If I Did It book sales to the newly founded Ron Goldman Foundation for Justice.[17] It provides grants for multiple organizations and programs that provide resources to victims and survivors of violent crimes.[18] One of the largest donors to the foundation is Las Vegas executive Mark Goldman, Fred's first cousin.\n\nPortrayals [ edit ]\n\nGoldman was portrayed by Paul Witten in the TV movie The O. J. Simpson Story. He was portrayed by Russ Russo in Reenactment of the Century. He will be portrayed by Oliver Walker in Joshua Newton\u2019s upcoming 2019 film Nicole & O.J..\n\nSee also [ edit ]"}

{"label": true, "txt": "(Note: This post contains spoilers for \u201cAmerican Horror Story: Cult\u201d through the Sept. 26 episode.)\n\nFor four episodes, \u201cAmerican Horror Story: Cult\u201d has been weaving a story about a murderous clown cult, and a bunch of other weird stuff, kicked up by the fear and chaos following the contentious 2016 election. Up to now, things have been pretty confusing as the show focused on Ally (Sarah Paulson), a woman with a host of phobias who\u2019s been seemingly terrorized by a group of murder clowns who, at least at points, seemed like they might have been in her head.\n\nOver time, the show has developed the fact that Kai (Evan Peters) is actually the chief creator of chaos on the show. And in Episode 4, we finally see him really at work, taking the side of vulnerable people, no matter what they believe, in order to draw them into his plot.\n\nAlso Read: 'American Horror Story: Cult': Important 2016 Election Facts You Need to Remember\n\nIt seems Kai is the guy behind the clown cult, with its bloody smiley face insignia, and in Episode 4 we see him convince one person to commit murder and another to cut off his own hand on Election Night to ensure he could \u201cpull the lever for go f\u2013k yourself\u201d (Trump, as it happens).\n\nSome of the pieces are coming together \u2014 Harrison (Billy Eichner) and Meadow (Leslie Grossman) are apparently a part of the clown cult, as is newscaster Beverly (Adina Porter) \u2014 and Kai is definitely involved in murders. And his actions in the first three episodes might mean that the goal of the clowns terrorizing Ally is to get her to join up, like the other characters he\u2019s targeted.\n\nBut the questions still outweigh the answers. There\u2019s the weird chemical spray truck and Harrison\u2019s crazy plastic barrels (which are of the variety Walter White used to dissolve bodies on \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d if you remember). Nothing about Winter (Billie Lourd), Kai\u2019s Hillary-supporting, liberal stereotype sister, seems to make sense at all. And what about Ivy (Alison Pill), who apparently didn\u2019t just know Winter before she and Ally hired her to be their nanny, but kidnapped a guy with her?\n\nAlso Read: 'American Horror Story: Cult' Fans Are Finally Putting It All Together\n\nIt\u2019s not that the hints that \u201cAmerican Horror Story: Cult\u201d is dropping aren\u2019t landing. The first three episodes did a solid job of portraying Kai first as a bigot, then as a manipulator, before finally putting the pieces together to show him as a charismatic murder-leader. There were plenty of clues popping up about Harrison and Meadow, and fans have been suspicious of Ivy from the start.\n\nBut what\u2019s interesting, and ultimately confusing, is just how much information the show is throwing at people, and how many questions it\u2019s raising. Not just about who\u2019s in the cult, but what the cult is trying to do, and how seemingly unrelated elements factor in as well.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot like \u201cLost,\u201d really. Not only is there the hatch to wonder about, but there\u2019s the polar bear. And the bus. And the monster. And the numbers. And the strange connection that seems to bind all the characters together.\n\nAlso Read: 'American Horror Story: Cult' Fans Can't Help But Ask, 'Why Are You Wearing Sombreros?'\n\n\u201cAmerican Horror Story: Cult\u201d has that kind of stuff going on as well, and it\u2019s still not even close to clear how everything fits together. For instance, we know Kai is a cult leader, and we know he\u2019s recruited several people \u2014 but we haven\u2019t seen anyone as the clowns yet. And the murder of Serina (Emma Roberts) seems to have taken place before any of the other clown murders, as Kai was recruiting Beverly. Three clowns were present for that one. They could have been Kai, Meadow and Harrison, but it seems a bit early to take your new pals out on a murder spree. So does that mean Kai has other recruits waiting in the wings (with knives) that we haven\u2019t seen yet?\n\nThere\u2019s one other element that\u2019s exploding a lot of fans\u2019 theories and attempts to understand \u201cAHS: Cult\u201d after four episodes: Harrison and Meadow. At the end of Episode 3, \u201cNeighbors from Hell,\u201d Meadow disappeared and Harrison was found covered in blood. Earlier in the episode, the cult\u2019s smiley face mark was seen on their house.\n\nWhy would Kai and the cult target their own? There have been hints about why the cult might kill Meadow, but why leave Harrison alive, when he could potentially turn on everybody? (Also, a quick tangent: Honestly, what is going on with Winter?)\n\nAlso Read: 'American Horror Story: Cult' Fans Agree: Ozzy Has the Right Idea\n\nWith weird additional elements like the chemical sprayers, it might be a mistake to think that everything in \u201cAmerican Horror Story: Cult\u201d is connected, or at least, connected to the cult. As has been the case in previous seasons of the anthology series, sometimes the links between ancillary things and the main story are a bit tenuous \u2014 the scares are more important than everything making sense together.\n\nThen again, maybe we\u2019re just thinking about this mystery wrong. Maybe fans aren\u2019t seeing the big picture yet. Maybe Kai\u2019s clown cult isn\u2019t the only clown cult in town.\n\nIt might be confusing, but trying to puzzle out where \u201cAmerican Horror Story: Cult\u201d is headed is the most fun part of the season so far."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Dolly Parton is a straight up legend in country music. Her sweet, sultry voice is so amazing. She was gifted with extraordinary musical talents since she was very young. Have you noticed she is ALWAYS wearing long sleeves no matter the temperature? She always covers her arms. Want to know why? Here you go:\n\nIt all started when she was young\n\nIt seems like everyone knows who Dolly Parton is, but not many people know the intimate details of her past. Her upbringing certainly contributed to some secrets she has hidden over the years, and of course some of her quirks. She is passionate about being a feminist, she refuses to wear any clothes that reveal her arms, and she had kept her private life on the down low despite her major stardom. So to truly understand why she is the way that she is, you need to know about her from the beginning\u2026.\n\nShe Has 11 Siblings\n\nBefore she was famous, Dolly Parton was \u201cdirt poor.\u201d She was born Dolly Rebecca Parton on January 19, 1946, in Tennessee. Did you know she has 12 siblings?! Her father worked as a farmer and construction worker, and her mom took care of the kids. The entire family had to live in a one-room cabin.\n\nThe Church Was Her Stage\n\nThe Parton family were regular churchgoers, and it was a huge part of Dolly\u2019s childhood. When she was just 6 she began performing in front of the congregation. Two years later she has gifted her first guitar from her uncle. The rest is history! She started performing on local TV and radio shows.\n\nJohnny Cash Gave Her Advice\n\nWhen Dolly was only 13, she sang at the legendary country music venue the Grand Ole Opry Hotel. Guess who she met backstage? None other than Johnny Cash. He told her to never give up on her dreams, no matter how big they were. He also told her to trust her own instincts and to not get pushed around by music industry executives.\n\n\n\nMoving to Nashville\n\nParton graduated from high school in 1964 and then moved to the epicenter of country music: Nashville. Despite her gifted voice, she had a hard time at first. She wasn\u2019t even singing, she started out by just composing songs for other artists with her uncle Bill Owens. Together they composed two top 10 hits!\n\nShe Gets a Record Deal\n\nWith talent like Dolly\u2019s, it was just a question of time before she landed a record deal. She signed with Monument Records when she was only 19 years old! Their vision wasn\u2019t exactly what Dolly had in mind for herself. They wanted her to be a squeaky clean pop artist who targeted the teenage market in the 60s and 70s. She recorded some singles, but none of them were successful.\n\nShe Makes a Change\n\nYou could definitely say the pop music world\u2019s huge loss was country music\u2019s gigantic gain! After Dolly composed Bill Phillips biggest hit ever, she went on to sing some simple harmonies for him. This allowed her to transition from pop to country music. The first two country singles she released from her album \u201cHello, I\u2019m Dolly\u201d were hits! They reached number 17 and 24 on the country music charts in 1967. It was pretty clear she found her true calling! Dolly as a country star was born!\n\nOn the Wagon\n\nWith her blossoming country music career, Dolly Parton was asked to appear on The Porter Wagoner Show. This was a musical variety show which now is considered the launch point for Dolly\u2019s amazing career. She wasn\u2019t immediately well received by audiences, she was actually replaced with Norma Jean. The audience actually came to greatly prefer Dolly and were very vocal about it.\n\nGoing Solo\n\nWhile it is hard to image Dolly Parton being anything besides a solo singer, she and Wagoner actually put out a number of songs together until she left the show in 1974. She was then signed to RCA Victor label. Her very first single, \u201cJust Because I\u2019m A Woman,\u201d disappointed her. It only reached the #17 spot on the charts. She released a number of other solo singles in the late 60s, but none were as successful as the work she did with Wagoner.\n\n\n\nAt Last\n\nWagoner had an idea to change this and allow Dolly Parton to become the solo star she dreamed of being. He convinced her to record her own version of \u201cMule Skinner Blues.\u201d It was originally a hit for Jimmie Rodgers. Finally, her solo career was taking off and the song hit #3 on the charts! She then recorded her first ever #1 single: \u201cJoshua.\u201d She continued to top the charts in the years following.\n\nTough Love\n\nWhile they clearly had huge success when they collaborated, Parton and Wagoner actually often clashed about the direction of Dolly\u2019s career. They were both headstrong and often butted heads. Over time, it became evident that Dolly needed to leave, but Wagoner sued her for a breach of contract when she tried. In an attempt to tell him how she would always feel, she had him take a seat as she sang \u201cI Will Always Love You.\u201d\n\nPlease Don\u2019t Take My Man!\n\n\u201cCoat of Many Colors,\u201d is regarded as one of Dolly Parton\u2019s signature songs, but it actually only reached #4. In the late 70s, she released her biggest hit ever! It was \u201cJolene\u201d of course. Not only did it sore straight up to the top of the country charts, but it was a success in the UK. The song was written by Parton, and it is now considered one of the greatest songs of all time by Rolling Stone magazine. How cool is that!\n\nBack to Pop\n\nWhile she hadn\u2019t experienced instant success in the genre of pop, it didn\u2019t stop her from trying in the late 70s. She first started to work with Sandy Gallin who went on to be her manager for the next 25 years.\n\nHere She Comes Again\n\nDolly continued to aim at appealing to a more mainstream audience. She released \u201cHere You Come Again,\u201d which sold over 1 million copies! It just shot up to the top of the country charts and also reached number 20 on the pop charts! There was even bigger success to follow. One of her most successful songs actually weren\u2019t composed by herself, it was written by Cynthia Weil and Barry Mann.\n\nAward Winning!\n\nIt was actually not until the late 80s that Dolly Parton became a huge star. She released the album \u201cTrio.\u201d It spent an amazing 5 weeks on top of the country charts! Her streak didn\u2019t stop there! Later in 1999, she was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. She went on to greate more Grammy-award winning albums with her unique Bluegrass style.\n\nWe Will Always Love Her!\n\nAs she started her career as a songwriter, it shouldn\u2019t be shocking that some of her songs have been covered by other huge stars. Who could forget when Whitney Houston sang \u201cI Will Always Love You,\u201d for the film \u201cThe Bodyguard.\u201d Also, Kenny Rogers and LeAnn Rimes have their own versions.\n\nThe Oscars Come a Calling\n\nDolly Parton hasn\u2019t only won a series of music awards, but also she has been nominated for Academy Awards. Her song \u201c9 to 5\u201d was featured on the film\u2019s soundtrack. The film actually starred Parton, Jane Fonda, and Lily Tomlin! What an all-star cast! She was nominated for an Oscar as well for a song featured in \u201cTransamerica.\u201d The film tells the story of a transgender woman on a road trip with her son.\n\nDinner With Dolly?\n\nThe song was about the 9 to 5 work days. It shouldn\u2019t be surprising that Dolly Parton is a savvy entrepreneur but clearly doesn\u2019t have to keep those hours. She has a number of investments in businesses in Eastern Tennessee, including her own Dollywood theme park! She also has a dinner theatre show called \u201cDolly Parton\u2019s Dixie Stampede,\u201d which is performed and popular all across the USA.\n\nNot Riding High\n\nYou\u2019d think if someone owns a theme park, they would probably like roller coasters. It turns out that Dolly Parton has never ridden a single ride at Dollywood! Why? She gets motion sickness. Her motion sickness was so severe that she even got sick on the school bus as a child.\n\nA Talented Actress\n\nBesides being a talented composer and songstress, Dolly Parton is also an accomplished actress. She first dabbled in acting on \u201cThe Port Wagoner Show,\u201d and she didn\u2019t stop there. She starred in her own show entitled \u201cDolly!\u201d and got great reviews for her performance for \u201cThe Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.\u201d She co-starred in this film with Burt Reynolds.\n\nSignature Style\n\nIt turns out her role as Miss Mona in \u201cThe Best Little Whorehouse\u201d wasn\u2019t far-fetched. In the film, Dolly Parton runs the Chicken Ranch brothel. She has statted her signature look was inspired by a real-life woman of the night! She explained in an interview when she was a young girl she saw a lady with big yellow hair, bright red lipstick, and high heels. She decided that was exactly how she wanted to look.\n\nTime for Love\n\nNaturally, Dolly Parton\u2019s life had more than just her career. She has had a very intriguing love life. She has been married to Cal Thomas Dean since 1966! That\u2019s a long time! They got hitched in Ringgold, Georgia. Dolly changed her name to Dolly Parton Dean officially but still performs under her maiden name. Cal likes to stay out of the spotlight and has actually only seen her perform one time!\n\nTrue Romance\n\nDolly Parton and Dean never spoke about it, and let fate decide when they would have children. She spoke very candidly about it and said she wasn\u2019t destined to be the mother of two children, but rather a mother of everyone! She also has been open about praising Dean for his romantic gestures. The couple recently renewed their wedding vows and despite the rumors they are considered one of the strongest, longest lasting couples in showbiz!\n\nA Family Affair\n\nOne very interesting fact is Dolly Parton is the godmother to Miley Cyrus! Now that Miley is all grown up, the pair has collaborated. They sang a rendition of Jolene together, and Parton acts as a source of support in her life. When the media has criticized Miley, Dolly has publically defended her.\n\nForever Young\n\nWant to know how Dolly looks so great? It is due to a mixture of good genes but also plastic surgery! If something drops, she gets a little nip and tuck. She often jokes about it and we love that! She has stated in interviews while she might look fake on the outside, she\u2019s real \u201cwhere it counts.\u201d She really believes every woman should do whatever they want as long as they feel and look good.\n\nNot Herself?\n\nDolly Parton definitely has one of the most iconic looks in the music business. Her big blonde hair, big bosoms, coupled with her big personality is her trademark. As a joke, she actually competed in a Dolly Parton lookalike contest and lost. She said, \u201cI didn\u2019t even come close.\u201d She also said many of the competitors were guys!\n\n\n\nJust Friends\n\nBecause she is rarely seen with her husband, and due to her close relationship with her female childhood friend, Parton was accused of being secretly gay by the media. There are many pictures of her with Judy Ogle holding hands. The two have been best friends since she was in 3rd grade. While Dolly has said she loves Judy, they have nothing romantic going on between them.\n\nBuilding Bridges\n\nDespite their falling out many years prior, Dolly rushed to be at Porter Wagoner\u2019s bedside when he was battling lung cancer. He passed away when he was 80 years old. Dolly was there to support him and also so they could say goodbye. She stated in an interview this experience was extremely difficult, and she prayed for him.\n\nThe Feud That Never Was\n\nThe media spun Dolly Parton as being jealous of Whitney Houston\u2019s success with her own rendition of \u201cI Will Always Love You.\u201d This couldn\u2019t be farther from the truth! The pair often spoke of how much they liked each other! Whitney personally thanked Dolly for allowing her to sing the song, and Parton said she was honored she wanted to cover it. How cute!\n\nBook Days!\n\nGrowing up in poverty definitely led her to help other children in need when she was able to. She launched the Dollywood Foundation which allows children to get a new book every month from the time they are born until they reach kindergarten. She definitely is responsible for many bedtime stories!\n\n\n\nTeaching Tolerance\n\nDolly Parton also holds an annual Gay Day charity event at Dollywood to support the LGBT community. She says, anyone, that judges in Dollywood is committing a sin. She stated, \u201cI try to love everybody.\u201d We love this and we love you, Dolly!\n\nShe Once Tried to Commit Suicide\n\nWhile from the outside perspective, it might seem like she is happy and has it all. Like most of us, Dolly has had some hard times in her life and actually attempted suicide. While married, she and her husband decided to have an open relationship. When she broke up with her other man, it sent her on a downward spiral. She attempted to commit suicide, but fortunately, her Boston Terrier Popeye helped her realize she was making a huge mistake and she put down the gun.\n\nPresident Parton\n\nIt is still a giant mystery how Dolly Parton voted in the last presidential election. There are some quotes that indicate she may have supported Hillary Clinton. She also has hinted she might run for herself and jokes that she has the hair for it! She\u2019d definitely get our vote!\n\nShe\u2019s More Relevant Than Ever\n\nWhile Dolly is getting older, she is showing absolutely no signs of slowing down! Her most recent tour was one of her biggest ever in the USA. She also recently performed on The Voice with Miley Cyrus! It doesn\u2019t stop there. She was also presented with the Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award at the Country Music Awards. Good things just keep on coming her way!\n\nRags to Riches\n\nWhile Dolly grew up \u201cdirt poor,\u201d she obviously isn\u2019t any longer! She is worth about $500 million! Wow! She earned a lot of money from royalties earned from Houston\u2019s version of \u201cI Will Always Love You.\u201d She has real rags to riches story and we are so proud of her!\n\nA Tattooed Lady?\n\nThere is speculation Dolly is covered with many secret tattoos. When you think about it, how often do you see Dolly wearing a super low cut or sleeveless shirts? The reality is she does have some ink! She has a little heart that has been spotted on her cleavage. Roseanne Barr stated Dolly also showed her an \u201cawesome\u201d pastel bow tattoo.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s All in the Hair\n\nOne part of Dolly Parton\u2019s iconic image is her hair. She actually owns and wears a number of wings. Why? She first started experimenting with wigs at a young age and found it easier to achieve different shapes and styles. She claims she never leaves her home without a wig. Whatever works for you, Dolly! We think you look great!\n\nDolly the Sheep\n\nOne of the most infamous scientific experiments ever was named after her! Dolly, the sheep was named after Dolly Parton. If you didn\u2019t know this, don\u2019t feel bad. We didn\u2019t know either! The experiment occurred in 1995 when scientists created a clone sleep from a somatic cell. The scientists named it after her because of her large bust. See, it wasn\u2019t totally random!\n\nThe Lookalike Contest Fail\n\nDolly is known for taking a risk or two. On one Halloween night, she took part in a transgender lookalike contest on Santa Monica Boulevard and lost! I bet the audience went crazy when she revealed it was actually her competing!\n\nRecreating Fond Memories\n\nAs we mentioned, Dolly was raised in a very low-income household with 12 siblings. Her childhood house in Tennessee didn\u2019t have good plumbing or electricity. When she hit it big, she gave money to her brother Bobby to restore and improve the house. She wanted to keep it looking exactly the same, and only wanted to improve the plumbing and electricity. Interesting!\n\nBarbie Influence\n\nFor a big portion of her life, Dolly wanted to be as pretty as Barbie. Part of this stems from the fact she comes from a poor family. Her entire life she has dreamed of being beautiful and even wrote \u201cBackwards Barbie\u201d about it. Some lyrics include, \u201cI wanted to be pretty more than anything in the world, like Barbie. From rags to wishes in my dreams I could have it all. I\u2019m just a backwoods Barbie, too much makeup, too much hair. Don\u2019t be fooled by thinkin\u2019 that the goods are not there.\u201d\n\nBody Art\n\nHave you heard the rumors? For years the media has speculated that Dolly Parton is secretly covered in tattoos and that is the reason why she always has her arms covered. In a recent interview, she stated, \u201chave a few little tattoos, but they were mostly done to cover scars because I\u2019m so fair.\u201d Will the rumor be laid to rest now? We will see!\n\nCorn Song\n\nBefore Dolly even learned how to write, her mom helped her write songs! Even from a young age, the lyrics just came pouring out of Dolly. Her first song is called \u201cLittle Tiny Tasseltop.\u201d Some lyrics from the song go: \u201cLittle tiny tasseltop, I love you an awful lot. Corn silk hair and big brown eyes, How you make me smile.\u201d\n\n5,000 Songs\n\nTo this day, guess how many songs Dolly has written? The answer: more than 5,000 songs! Not all of them have been released, but Dolly tries to write a new song every two or three days. How amazing!\n\nSame-Same\n\nDolly Parton\u2019s biggest hits? Easily her most popular songs are \u201cJolene\u201d and \u201cI Will Always Love You.\u201d Did you know she penned both songs on the same night back in 1973? Pretty crazy, right?\n\nIslands in the Stream\n\nWhen Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers released their song, \u201cIslands In The Stream,\u201d it didn\u2019t take long for it to soar to the top of the charts. It quickly rose to become the #1 duet of all time on the CMT 100 greatest country duets. Did you know the Bee Gees actually wrote the song?\n\nNothing But A Rumor\n\nBilly Ray Cyrus credits Dolly Parton for kick-starting his career. After he released his first album, Dolly asked him to open for her in a few concerts. Once he started to open for her, his career really took off! The media speculated the two were more than just friends. When Cyrus began to apologize to Dolly for all the rumors, Dolly replied, \u201cHoney, that sh*t sells records!\u201d\n\nNot Far Off\n\nMany people think Dolly and her sister Stella look a lot alike. Do you agree? We do! Stella is actually also a singer who recently released a new album entitled, \u201cMountain Songbird.\u201d Dolly inspired the album.\n\nHuge Fan\n\nIn 1998, Drew Barrymore spoke about Dolly\u2019s film: \u201cHome Fries\u201d before it was released. Barrymore\u2019s character was a huge fan of Dolly Parton and told her that some of her songs would appear in the film. When the film was released, it wasn\u2019t as Dolly centered as initially thought. There were few Dolly Parton references, but the film did include some posters and pictures of her.\n\nHaving A Laugh\n\nDolly is well known for her great sense of humor. It seems like she is always making people laugh! For example, she said, \u201cI\u2019m not offended by all the dumb blonde jokes because I know I\u2019m not dumb\u2026 and I also know that I\u2019m not blonde.\u201d She also said, \u201cI was the first woman to burn my bra \u2013 it took the fire department four days to put it out.\u201d Oh, my.\n\nBaaaaaaaa\n\nBack in 1995, the first mammal was cloned successfully. Why should we care? Well, they named it after Dolly! Ian Wilmut, the man who cloned the sheep, explained, \u201cDolly is derived from a mammary gland cell and we couldn\u2019t think of a more impressive pair of glands than Dolly Parton\u2019s.\u201d\n\nBaaad Publicity\n\nAt first, when Dolly learned how the sheep got its name, she was happy! She stated, \u201cshe was called after me because she had big mammary glands. She gave me a lot of competition\u2026 but I always said there\u2019s no such thing as baaad publicity.\u201d\n\nA Bridge Too\n\nHaving a sheep named after your bosom is nice, and it actually is not the only thing named after Dolly\u2019s bust. Did you know the General W.K. Wilson Jr. Bridge or the Dolly Parton bridge is another example? It is located in Mobile, Alabama.\n\nNicknames-a-plenty\n\nDolly Parton has a ton of nicknames! Some include The Smoky Mountain Songbird, The Iron Butterfly, The Queen of Country, The Backwoods Barbie, The Queen of Nashville, The Book Lady, The Leading Lady of Country, and Aunt Granny. A pretty long list, right?\n\n\n\nThick And Thin Skin\n\nWhen it comes to life, there is a lot we can learn from Dolly Parton. She has definitely made a point that having thick skin is absolutely critical to living a happy life. She believes being tough keeps bad vides out of your reach. She also very much believes in love!\n\n\n\nGreatest Love\n\nDuring a recent interview, Parton revealed, \u201cMy music is what took me everywhere I\u2019ve been and everywhere I will go. It\u2019s my greatest love. I can\u2019t abandon it. I\u2019ll always keep making records.\u201d She truly is so passionate about what she does.\n\nBig Spender\n\nDolly Parton has learned to care a little bit less when people criticize her fashion choices. Guess what? She loves how she looks. She is very confident, and this is one reason we love her so much.\n\nRegrets\n\nFor a while now, Dolly has admitted she regrets not having children. In fact, during a recent interview with ABC news, she stated, \u201cI used to think I should regret it. Early on, when my husband and I were dating, and then when we got married, we just assumed we would have kids. We weren\u2019t doing anything to stop it. In fact, we thought maybe we would. We even had names if we did, but it didn\u2019t turn out that way.\u201d\n\nThree\u2019s Company\n\nDid you know there was once a story about Dolly Parton, her BFF Jude and Sylvester Stallone? It is alleged the three of them got together and had a passionate threesome! Can you believe that? It is still unclear if this ever really happened or not.\n\nBesties For Life\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the only rumor about Dolly Parton and her best friend Judy Ogle. Many people are curious if they are friends or a little more! Some people even question if Dolly is bi-sexual! In an interview, Dolly stated, \u201d \u201cJudy and I have been best friends since we were like in the third and fourth grade. I mean, I love her as much as I love anybody in the whole world, but we\u2019re not romantically involved.\u201d\n\nHeart of the Matter\n\nEveryone is curious about Dolly Parton\u2019s love life and specifically her relationship with her husband, Carl. In an interview with the Daily Mail, Dolly stated, \u201cI love to flirt, and I\u2019ve never met a man I didn\u2019t like. Men are my weakness. Short, fat, bald or skinny \u2013 I\u2019ve had crushes on some very unusual men but Carl knows I\u2019ll always come home and I\u2019m not having sex with these people \u2013 I\u2019m just flirtin\u2019 and having fun.\u201d\n\nC-C-C-Changes\n\nDolly has experienced about 30 years of big boobs and it can be pretty painful! Dolly told Contact Music that she has been suffering and experiencing a ton of pain for the size of her boobs. She said in the interview, \u201cMy boobs are killing me \u2013 and I don\u2019t know if I can stand the pain any longer. My boobs have been a trademark for me \u2013 but I\u2019ve paid one hell of a price.\u201d\n\nDigits Please\n\nDo you have any idea how tall Dolly Parton is? Turns out she is only 4 feet, 9 inches. You know what else? She is absolutely larger than life. Want to know her chest size? It is actually 40DD. She even has it insured! Yes, she has her chest insured! How much? A whopping $300,000 each.\n\nThat Famous Bust\n\nDolly is well known for not only her singing, appearance, songwriting abilities, but of course her chest size. And you know what? She isn\u2019t afraid of it either. She once stated in an interview, \u201cMy boobs are fake, my hair\u2019s fake but what is real is my voice and my heart.\u201d\n\nBusted\n\nKids sometimes pick up on some things that adults don\u2019t. Parton explained in an interview, \u201cOnce I was going Christmas shopping. I did my makeup completely different with dark eyebrows, and wore a short black wig, and wore different clothes than I would normally wear.\u201d She continued, \u201cI said something, and this group of kids said, \u2018You\u2019re Dolly Parton in a black wig!'\u201d Her voice was a dead giveaway in this case!\n\nDisguises, Disguises\n\nSurprisingly, there was a period in Dolly\u2019s life where she felt the need to disguise herself when she went out in public. Just like most celebrities, sometimes they want some peace and quiet in public. Dolly attempted to conceal her identity with all sorts of things like wigs and makeup. Nothing seemed to work and she was totally recognizable!\n\nThe Imagination Library\n\nDid you know in 1995 Dolly Parton started the book distribution company called \u201cThe Imagination Library.\u201d She was actually inspired by her own father\u2019s inability to read and write! How interesting! She started the drive in 1995, which does book donations to children under the age of 5. The goal is if they are introduced to books at a young age, they will fall in love with reading and keep reading!\n\nBusiness Savvy\n\nDolly is also a very successful businesswoman. Pretty early on her career, she created Velvet Apple Music (BMI). This allows her to own the copyrights and publish all her own songs. In addition to that, she launched her own record label in 2007 called Dolly Records. When the label was first launched, she was the only person to appear on the label. She also did all the branding. Good on you, Dolly!\n\nCrushing\n\nMost people know this a little, but Johnny Cash had a huge influence on Dolly Parton. He told her to definitely pursue a career in music, and he was her first official crush. She stated when she saw him, \u201cI was sitting in the audience and that\u2019s when I first knew about sex appeal\u2026 he had this tick when he moved his shoulder\u2026 and it was still sexy. It still got to me.\u201d\n\nDream Big\n\nDolly Parton knew from a young age that she was meant to be a star. When she was only 13 she recorded the song \u201cPuppy Love.\u201d When she first appeared on the Grand Ole Opry, she met Johnny Cash who told her to follow her instincts and pursue a career in music.\n\nStormzy Speaks\n\nStormzy is an English hip-hop star. When she reviewd Jolene on Twitter she stated, \u201cAnd Jolene sounds like she\u2019s the baddest b to ever walk this planet.\u201d\n\nFirst, I\u2019m A Songwriter\n\nDolly Parton is a seriously talented songwriter! She has actually composed over 3,000 songs including \u201cI Will Always Love You.\u201d She is also one of few to be nominated for multiple Academy Awards, Grammys, Tony\u2019s and Emmy Awards."}
{"label": true, "txt": "Eldrick Tont \"Tiger\" Woods (born December 30, 1975) is an American professional golfer who is among the most successful golfers of all time, and one of the most popular athletes of the 21st century. He has been one of the highest-paid athletes in the world for several years.[5][6][7] Woods is generally considered one of the greatest golfers of all time.[8][9][10]\n\nFollowing an outstanding junior, college, and amateur career, Woods was 20 years old when he turned professional at the end of summer in 1996. By the end of April 1997, he had won three PGA Tour events in addition to his first major, the 1997 Masters. Woods won this tournament by 12 strokes in a record-breaking performance and earned $486,000. He first reached the number one position in the world rankings in June 1997, less than a year after turning pro. Throughout the 2000s, Woods was the dominant force in golf\u2014he won the 2000 U.S. Open by a record 15-shot margin. He was the top-ranked golfer in the world from August 1999 to September 2004 (264 weeks) and again from June 2005 to October 2010 (281 weeks).\n\nWoods took a self-imposed hiatus from professional golf from December 2009 to early April 2010 to resolve marital issues. Woods and his estranged wife Elin eventually divorced. His many alleged extramarital indiscretions were revealed by several women, through many worldwide media sources.[11] This coincided with a series of injuries, treatments by the controversial doctor Anthony Galea, who had been linked to HGH,[12] and a loss of golf form. His placement in the Official World Golf Rankings gradually fell to a low of No. 58 in November 2011.[13][14] He ended a career-high winless streak of 107 weeks when he triumphed in the Chevron World Challenge in December 2011.[14] After winning the Arnold Palmer Invitational on March 25, 2013, he ascended to the No.1 ranking once again, holding the top spot until May 2014, by which time he had been ranked number one for a record total of 683 weeks. From 2014\u20132017, Woods had been unable to recapture his dominant form, undergoing four back surgeries in 2014, 2015 and 2017.[15] In May 2016, Woods dropped out of the world top 500 for the first time in his professional career.[16] After falling to #1199 in the World Golf Ranking in December 2017, Woods rose over 1000 places by mid-2018.[17][18] In September 2018, he won his first tournament in five years with a victory at the Tour Championship and moved to #13 in the Official World Golf Rankings.\n\nWoods has broken numerous golf records. He has been World Number One for the most consecutive weeks and for the greatest total number of weeks of any golfer. He has been awarded PGA Player of the Year a record eleven times,[19] the Byron Nelson Award for lowest adjusted scoring average a record eight times, and has the record of leading the money list in ten different seasons. He has won 14 professional major golf championships, where he trails only Jack Nicklaus who leads with 18, and 80 PGA Tour events, second all-time behind Sam Snead (82).[20] Woods leads all active golfers in career major wins and career PGA Tour wins. He is the youngest player to achieve the career Grand Slam, and the youngest and fastest to win 50 tournaments on tour. Additionally, Woods is only the second golfer (after Nicklaus) to have achieved a career Grand Slam three times. Woods has won 18 World Golf Championships, and won at least one of those events in each of the first 11 years after they began in 1999. Woods and Rory McIlroy are the only golfers to win both The Silver Medal and The Gold Medal at The Open Championship.\n\nBackground and family\n\nWoods was born in 1975 in Cypress, California,[21] to Earl[22] and Kultida \"Tida\" Woods.[23] He is the only child of their marriage, and has two half-brothers, Earl Jr. and Kevin, as well as a half-sister named Royce from his father's first marriage.[24]\n\nKultida (n\u00e9e Punsawad) is originally from Thailand, where Earl had met her on a tour of duty in 1968. She is of mixed Thai, Chinese, and Dutch ancestry.[25] Earl was a retired lieutenant colonel and Vietnam War veteran who was mostly African American with traces of European descent. Earl's mother Maude Carter was light skinned. Some people suggested that she had Native American and Chinese ancestry.[26] Tiger refers to his ethnic make-up as \"Cablinasian\" (a syllabic abbreviation he coined from Caucasian, Black, American Indian, and Asian).[27]\n\nWoods' first name\u2014Eldrick\u2014was coined by his mother because it began with \"E\" (for Earl) and ended with \"K\" (for Kultida). His middle name Tont is a traditional Thai name. He was nicknamed Tiger in honor of his father's friend Col. Vuong Dang Phong, who had also been known as Tiger.[28]\n\nWoods' niece, Cheyenne Woods, played for the Wake Forest University golf team and turned professional in 2012, when she made her pro debut in the LPGA Championship.[29]\n\nEarly life and amateur golf career\n\nWoods grew up in Orange County, California. He was a child prodigy who was introduced to golf before the age of two by his athletic father, Earl Woods. Earl was a single-digit handicap amateur golfer who also was one of the earliest African-American college baseball players at Kansas State University.[30] Tiger's father was a member of the military and had playing privileges at the Navy golf course beside the Joint Forces Training Base in Los Alamitos, which allowed Tiger to play there. Tiger also played at the par 3 Heartwell golf course in Long Beach, as well as some of the municipals in Long Beach.[31]\n\nIn 1978, Tiger putted against comedian Bob Hope in a television appearance on The Mike Douglas Show. At age three, he shot a 48 over nine holes at the Navy course. At age five, he appeared in Golf Digest and on ABC's That's Incredible![32] Before turning seven, Tiger won the Under Age 10 section of the Drive, Pitch, and Putt competition, held at the Navy Golf Course in Cypress, California.[33] In 1984 at the age of eight, he won the 9\u201310 boys' event, the youngest age group available, at the Junior World Golf Championships.[34] He first broke 80 at age eight.[35] He went on to win the Junior World Championships six times, including four consecutive wins from 1988 to 1991.[36][37][38][39][40]\n\nWoods' father Earl wrote that Tiger first defeated him at the age of 11 years, with Earl trying his best. Earl lost to Tiger every time from then on.[41][42] Woods first broke 70 on a regulation golf course at age 12.[43]\n\nWhen Woods was 13 years old, he played in the 1989 Big I, which was his first major national junior tournament. In the final round, he was paired with pro John Daly, who was then relatively unknown. The event's format placed a professional with each group of juniors who had qualified. Daly birdied three of the last four holes to beat Woods by only one stroke.[44] As a young teenager, Woods first met Jack Nicklaus in Los Angeles at the Bel-Air Country Club, when Nicklaus was performing a clinic for the club's members. Woods was part of the show, and he impressed Nicklaus and the crowd with his skills and potential.[45] Earl Woods had researched in detail the career accomplishments of Nicklaus and had set his young son the goals of breaking those records.[43]\n\nWoods was 15-years-old and a student at Western High School in Anaheim when he became the youngest U.S. Junior Amateur champion; this was a record that stood until it was broken by Jim Liu in 2010.[46] He was named 1991's Southern California Amateur Player of the Year (for the second consecutive year) and Golf Digest Junior Amateur Player of the Year. In 1992, he defended his title at the U.S. Junior Amateur Championship, becoming the tournament's first two-time winner. He also competed in his first PGA Tour event, the Nissan Los Angeles Open (he missed the 36-hole cut), and was named Golf Digest Amateur Player of the Year, Golf World Player of the Year, and Golfweek National Amateur of the Year.[47][48]\n\nThe following year, Woods won his third consecutive U.S. Junior Amateur Championship; he remains the event's only three-time winner.[49] In 1994, at the TPC at Sawgrass in Florida, he became the youngest winner of the U.S. Amateur Championship, a record he held until 2008 when it was broken by Danny Lee.[50] He was a member of the American team at the 1994 Eisenhower Trophy World Amateur Golf Team Championships (winning), and the 1995 Walker Cup (losing).[51][52]\n\nWoods graduated from Western High School at age 18 in 1994 and was voted \"Most Likely to Succeed\" among the graduating class. He had starred for the high school's golf team under coach Don Crosby.[53]\n\nWoods overcame difficulties with stuttering as a boy.[54][55][56] This was not known until he wrote a letter to a boy who contemplated suicide. Woods wrote, \"I know what it's like to be different and to sometimes not fit in. I also stuttered as a child and I would talk to my dog and he would sit there and listen until he fell asleep. I also took a class for two years to help me, and I finally learned to stop.\"[57]\n\nCollege golf career\n\nWoods was heavily recruited by college golf powers. He chose Stanford University, the 1994 NCAA champions. He enrolled at Stanford in the fall of 1994 under a golf scholarship and won his first collegiate event, the 40th Annual William H. Tucker Invitational, that September.[58] He selected a major in economics and was nicknamed \"Urkel\" by college teammate Notah Begay III.[59] In 1995, he successfully defended his U.S. Amateur title at the Newport Country Club in Rhode Island[50] and was voted Pac-10 Player of the Year, NCAA First Team All-American, and Stanford's Male Freshman of the Year (an award that encompasses all sports).[60][61]\n\nAt age 19 (two years before he won the tournament), Woods participated in his first PGA Tour major, the 1995 Masters, and tied for 41st as the only amateur to make the cut. At age 20 in 1996, he became the first golfer to win three consecutive U.S. Amateur titles[62] and won the NCAA individual golf championship.[63] In winning the silver medal as leading amateur at The Open Championship, he tied the record for an amateur aggregate score of 281.[64] He left college after two years in order to turn professional in the golf industry. In 1996, Woods moved out of California, stating in 2013 that it was due to the state's high tax rate.[65][66]\n\nProfessional career\n\nWoods in 2001\n\nWoods turned pro at age 20 in August 1996 and immediately signed advertising deals with Nike, Inc. and Titleist that ranked as the most lucrative endorsement contracts in golf history at that time.[67][68] Woods was named Sports Illustrated's 1996 Sportsman of the Year and PGA Tour Rookie of the Year.[69] On April 13, 1997, he won his first major, the Masters, in record-breaking fashion and became the tournament's youngest winner at age 21.[70] Two months later, he set the record for the fastest ascent to No. 1 in the Official World Golf Rankings.[71] After a lackluster 1998, Woods finished the 1999 season with eight wins, including the PGA Championship, a feat not achieved since 1974.[72][73]\n\nIn 2000, Woods won six consecutive events on the PGA Tour, which was the longest winning streak since Ben Hogan did it in 1948. One of these was the 2000 U.S. Open, where he broke or tied nine tournament records in what Sports Illustrated called \"the greatest performance in golf history\", in which Woods won the tournament by a record 15-stroke margin and earned a check for $800,000.[74] At age 24, he became the youngest golfer to achieve the Career Grand Slam.[75] At the end of 2000, Woods had won nine of the twenty PGA Tour events he entered and had broken the record for lowest scoring average in tour history. He was named the Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year, the only athlete to be honored twice, and was ranked by Golf Digest magazine as the twelfth-best golfer of all time.[76][77]\n\nWhen Woods won the 2001 Masters, he became the only player to win four consecutive major professional golf titles, although not in the same calendar year.[78] Following a stellar 2001 and 2002 in which Woods continued to dominate the tour, Woods' career hit a slump.[72][79] He did not win a major in 2003 or 2004. In September 2004, Vijay Singh overtook Woods in the Official World Golf Rankings, ending Woods' record streak of 264 weeks at #1.[80]\n\nWoods rebounded in 2005, winning six official PGA Tour money events and reclaiming the top spot in July after swapping it back and forth with Singh over the first half of the year.[81]\n\nWoods began dominantly in 2006, winning his first two PGA tournaments but failing to capture his fifth Masters championship in April.[82][83] Following the death of his father in May, Woods took a nine-week hiatus from the tour and appeared rusty upon his return at the U.S. Open at Winged Foot, where he missed the cut.[84] However, he quickly returned to form and ended the year by winning six consecutive tour events. At the season's close, Woods had 54 total wins that included 12 majors; he had broken the tour records for both total wins and total majors wins over eleven seasons.[85]\n\nWoods continued to excel in 2007 and the first part of 2008. In April 2008, he underwent knee surgery and missed the next two months on the tour.[86] Woods returned for the 2008 U.S. Open, where he struggled the first day but ultimately claimed a dramatic sudden death victory over Rocco Mediate that followed an 18-hole playoff, after which Mediate said, \"This guy does things that are just not normal by any stretch of the imagination,\" and Kenny Perry added, \"He beat everybody on one leg.\"[87][88][89] Two days later, Woods announced that he would miss the remainder of the season due to additional knee surgery, and that his knee was more severely damaged than previously revealed, prompting even greater praise for his U.S. Open performance. Woods called it \"my greatest ever championship.\"[90][91][92] In Woods' absence, TV ratings for the remainder of the season suffered a huge decline from 2007.[93]\n\nWoods competing at the third annual Earl Woods Memorial Pro-Am (July 1, 2009)\n\nWoods had a much anticipated return to golf in 2009, when he performed well. His comeback included a spectacular performance at the 2009 Presidents Cup, but he failed to win a major, the first year since 2004 that he had not done so.[94][95][96] After his marital infidelities came to light and received massive media coverage at the end of 2009 (see further details below), Woods announced in December that he would be taking an indefinite break from competitive golf.[11] In February 2010, he delivered a televised apology for his behavior, saying \"I was wrong and I was foolish.\"[97] During this period, several companies ended their endorsement deals with Woods.[98]\n\nWoods returned to competition in April at the 2010 Masters, where he finished tied for fourth place.[99] He followed the Masters with poor showings at the Quail Hollow Championship and the Players Championship, where he withdrew in the fourth round, citing injury.[100] Shortly afterward, Hank Haney, Woods' coach since 2003, resigned the position. In August, Woods hired Sean Foley as Haney's replacement. The rest of the season went badly for Woods, who failed to win a single event for the first time since turning professional, while nevertheless finishing the season ranked No. 2 in the world.\n\nIn 2011, Woods' performance continued to suffer; this took its toll on his ranking. After falling to No. 7 in March, he rebounded to No. 5 with a strong showing at the 2011 Masters Tournament, where he tied for fourth place.[101][102][103] Due to leg injuries incurred at the Masters, he missed several summer stops on the PGA Tour. In July, he fired his longtime caddy Steve Williams (who was shocked by the dismissal), and replaced him on an interim basis with friend Bryon Bell.[104][105] After returning to tournament play in August, Woods continued to falter, and his ranking gradually fell to a low of #58.[14] He rose to No. 50 in mid-November after a third-place finish at the Emirates Australian Open, and broke his winless streak with a victory at December's Chevron World Challenge.[14][106]\n\nWoods began his 2012 season with two tournaments (the Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship and the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am) where he started off well, but struggled on the final rounds. Following the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, where he was knocked out in the second round by missing a 5-foot putt,[107] Woods revised his putting technique and tied for second at the Honda Classic, with the lowest final round score in his PGA Tour career. After a short time off due to another leg injury, Woods won the Arnold Palmer Invitational, his first win on the PGA Tour since the BMW Championship in September 2009. Following several dismal performances, Woods notched his 73rd PGA Tour win at the Memorial Tournament in June, tying Jack Nicklaus in second place for most PGA Tour victories;[108] a month later, Woods surpassed Nicklaus with a win at the AT&T National, to trail only Sam Snead, who accumulated 82 PGA tour wins.[109]\n\nThe year 2013 would bring a return of Woods' dominating play. In January, he won the Farmers Insurance Open by four shots for his 75th PGA Tour win. It was the seventh time he had won the event.[110] In March, he won the WGC-Cadillac Championship, also for the seventh time, giving him his 17th WGC title and first since 2009.[111] Two weeks later, he won the Arnold Palmer Invitational, winning the event for a record-tying 8th time. The win moved him back to the top of the world rankings.[112] To commemorate that achievement, Nike was quick to launch an ad with the tagline \"winning takes care of everything\".[113]\n\nDuring the 2013 Masters, Woods faced disqualification after unwittingly admitting in a post-round interview with ESPN that he had taken an illegal drop on the par-5 15th hole when his third shot had bounced off the pin and into the water. After further review of television footage, Woods was assessed a two-stroke penalty for the drop but was not disqualified.[114] He finished tied for fourth in the event. Woods won The Players Championship in May 2013, his second career win at the event, notching his fourth win of the 2013 season. It was the quickest he had gotten to four wins in any season in his professional career.\n\nWoods had a poor showing at the 2013 U.S Open as a result of an elbow injury sustained at The Players Championship. In finishing at 13-over-par, he recorded his worst score as a professional and finished 12 strokes behind winner Justin Rose. After a prolonged break because of the injury, during which he missed the Greenbrier Classic and his own AT&T National, he returned at the Open Championship at Muirfield. Despite being in contention all week and beginning the final round only two strokes behind Lee Westwood, he struggled with the speed of the greens and could only manage a 3-over-par 74 that left him tied for 6th place, five strokes behind eventual winner Phil Mickelson. Two weeks later, Woods returned to form at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, recording his 5th win of the season and 8th win at the event in its 15-year history. His second round 61 matched his record score on the PGA Tour and could easily have been a 59 were it not for some short missed birdie putts on the closing holes. This gave him a seven stroke lead that he held onto for the rest of the tournament. Woods would never contend at the PGA Championship at Oak Hill Country Club and would come short of winning a major for the 5th full season, only contending in two of the four majors in 2013.\n\nAfter a slow start to 2014, Woods injured himself during the final round of the Honda Classic and was unable to finish the tournament. He withdrew after the 13th hole, citing back pain.[115] He subsequently competed in the WGC-Cadillac Championship but was visibly in pain during much of the last round. He was forced to skip the Arnold Palmer Invitational at the end of March 2014,[116] and after undergoing back surgery, he announced on April 1 that he would miss the Masters for the first time since 1994.[117] Woods returned at the Quicken Loans National in June, however he stated that his expectations for the week were low. He would struggle with nearly every aspect of his game and miss the cut. He next played at The Open Championship, contested at Hoylake, where Woods had won eight years prior. Woods fired a brilliant 69 in the first round to put himself in contention, but shot 77 on Friday and would eventually finish 69th. Despite his back pain, he played at the 2014 PGA Championship where he failed to make the cut. On August 25, 2014, Woods and his swing coach Sean Foley parted ways. In the four years under Foley, he won eight times but no majors. He had previously won eight majors with Harmon and six with Haney. Woods said there is currently no timetable to find a replacement swing coach.[118]\n\nOn February 5, 2015, Woods withdrew from the Farmers Insurance Open after another back injury.[119] Woods stated on his website that it was unrelated to his previous surgery and he would take a break from golf until his back healed.[120] He returned for the Masters, finishing in a tie for 17th. In the final round, Woods injured his wrist after his club hit a tree root. He later stated that a bone popped out of his wrist, but he adjusted it back into place and finished the round.[121] Woods then missed the cut at the 2015 U.S. Open and Open Championship, the first time Woods missed the cut at consecutive majors, finishing near the bottom of the leaderboard both times.[122][123] He finished tied for 18th at the Quicken Loans National on August 2.[124] In late August 2015, Woods played quite well at the Wyndham Championship finishing the tournament at 13-under, only four strokes behind the winner, and tied for 10th place.[125] Woods offered only a brief comment on the speculation that he was still recovering from back surgery, saying it was \"just my hip\" but offering no specifics.[126]\n\nWoods had back surgery on September 16, 2015. In late March 2016, he announced that he would miss the Masters while he recovered from the surgery;[127] he had also missed the 2014 Masters due to a back problem.[128] \"I'm absolutely making progress, and I'm really happy with how far I've come,\" he explained in a statement. \"But I still have no timetable to return to competitive golf.\"[129] However, he did attend the Masters Champions Dinner on April 5, 2016.[130] For the first time in his career, he missed all four majors in one year due to problems with his back. In October 2016, he told Charlie Rose on PBS that he still wanted to break Jack Nicklaus's record of 18 major titles.[131] Woods underwent back surgery in December 2016 and spent the next 15 months off the Tour. He made his return to competitive golf in the Hero World Challenge.[132]\n\nWoods' back problems continued to hinder him in 2017, as he missed the cut at the Farmers Insurance Open in January, and pulled out of a European Tour event in Dubai on February 3. On March 31, Woods announced on his website that he would not be playing in the 2017 Masters Tournament despite being cleared to play by his doctors. Woods said that although he was happy with his rehabilitation, he did not feel \"tournament ready.\"[133][134] On April 20, Woods announced that he had undergone his fourth back surgery since 2014 to alleviate back and leg pain. Recovery time required up to six months, meaning that Woods would spend the rest of the year without playing any professional golf.[135][136] Woods returned to competitive golf at the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas. He shot rounds of 69-68-75-68 and finished tied for 9th place. His world ranking went from 1,199th to 668th, which was the biggest jump in the world rankings in his career.\n\nOn Sunday, March 11, 2018, he finished one-shot back and tied for second at the Valspar Championship in Florida, his first top-five finish on the PGA Tour since 2013.[137] He then tied for sixth with a score of five under par at the 2018 Open Championship.[138] At the last major of the year Woods finished second at the 2018 PGA Championship, two shots behind the winner Brooks Koepka. It was his best result in a major since 2009 (second at the 2009 PGA Championship) and moved up to 26th in the world rankings. His final round of 64 was his best ever final round in a major.[139][18]\n\nWoods got back in the winner's circle for the 80th time in his PGA Tour career on September 23, 2018, when he won the season-ending Tour Championship at East Lake Golf Club for the second time, and that tournament for the third time. He shot rounds of 65-68-65-71 to win by two strokes over Billy Horschel. He nearly also won the FedEx Cup, but Justin Rose made a birdie on the 18th hole to win by 41 points over Woods.[140]\n\nHonors\n\nWoods checking his drive in 2007\n\nOn August 20, 2007, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria Shriver announced that Woods would be inducted into the California Hall of Fame. He was inducted December 5, 2007 at The California Museum for History, Women and the Arts in Sacramento.[141][142]\n\nIn December 2009, Woods was named \"Athlete of the Decade\" by the Associated Press.[143] He was named Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year[144] a record-tying four times, and is one of only two people to be named Sports Illustrated's Sportsman of the Year more than once.\n\nSince his record-breaking win at the 1997 Masters, Woods became the biggest name in golf, and his presence in tournaments drew a huge fan following . Some sources have credited him for dramatically increasing prize money in golf, generating interest in new PGA tournament audiences, and for drawing the largest TV ratings in golf history.[69][145][146][147][148][149]\n\nEndorsements\n\nDuring the first decade of his professional career, Woods was the world's most marketable athlete.[150] Shortly after his 21st birthday in 1996, he signed endorsement deals with numerous companies, including General Motors, Titleist, General Mills, American Express, Accenture, and Nike, Inc. In 2000, he signed a 5-year, $105 million contract extension with Nike, which was the largest endorsement package signed by a professional athlete at that time.[151] Woods' endorsement has been credited with playing a significant role in taking the Nike Golf brand from a \"start-up\" golf company earlier in the previous decade to becoming the leading golf apparel company in the world and a major player in the equipment and golf ball market.[150][152] Nike Golf is one of the fastest growing brands in the sport, with an estimated $600 million in sales.[153] Woods has been described as the \"ultimate endorser\" for Nike Golf,[153] frequently seen wearing Nike gear during tournaments, and even in advertisements for other products.[151] Woods receives a percentage from the sales of Nike Golf apparel, footwear, golf equipment, golf balls,[150] and has a building named after him at Nike's headquarters campus in Beaverton, Oregon.[154]\n\nIn 2002, Woods was involved in every aspect of the launch of Buick's Rendezvous SUV. A company spokesman stated that Buick was happy with the value of Woods' endorsement, pointing out that more than 130,000 Rendezvous vehicles were sold in 2002 and 2003. \"That exceeded our forecasts,\" he was quoted as saying, \"It has to be in recognition of Tiger.\" In February 2004, Buick renewed Woods' endorsement contract for another five years, in a deal reportedly worth $40 million.[151]\n\nWoods collaborated closely with TAG Heuer to develop the world's first professional golf watch, which was released in April 2005.[155] The lightweight, titanium-construction watch, designed to be worn while playing the game, incorporates numerous innovative design features to accommodate golf play. It is capable of absorbing up to 5,000 Gs of shock, far in excess of the forces generated by a normal golf swing.[155] In 2006, the TAG Heuer Professional Golf Watch won the prestigious iF product design award in the Leisure/Lifestyle category.[156]\n\nWoods preparing for a photo shoot in 2006\n\nWoods also endorsed the Tiger Woods PGA Tour series of video games; he has done so since 1999.[157] In 2006, he signed a six-year contract with Electronic Arts, the series' publisher.[158]\n\nIn February 2007, Woods, Roger Federer and Thierry Henry became ambassadors for the \"Gillette Champions\" marketing campaign. Gillette did not disclose financial terms, though an expert estimated the deal could total between $10 million and $20 million.[159]\n\nIn October 2007, Gatorade announced that Woods would have his own brand of sports drink starting in March 2008. \"Gatorade Tiger\" was his first U.S. deal with a beverage company and his first licensing agreement. Although no figures were officially disclosed, Golfweek magazine reported that it was for five years and could pay him as much as $100 million.[160] The company decided in early fall 2009 to discontinue the drink due to weak sales.[161]\n\nIn October 2012, it was announced that Woods had signed an exclusive endorsement deal with Fuse Science, Inc, a sports nutrition firm.[162]\n\nIn 1997, Woods and golfer Arnold Palmer initiated a case against Bruce Matthews (the owner of Gotta Have It Golf, Inc.) and others in the effort to stop the unauthorized sale of their images and alleged signatures in the memorabilia market. Matthews and associated parties counterclaimed that Woods and his company, ETW Corporation, committed several acts including breach of contract, breach of implied duty of good faith, and violations of Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.[163] Palmer also was named in the counter-suit, accused of violating the same licensing agreement in conjunction with his company Arnold Palmer Enterprises.\n\nOn March 12, 2014, a Florida jury ruled in favor of Gotta Have It on its breach of contract and other related claims, rejected ETW's counterclaims, and awarded Gotta Have It $668,346 in damages.[164][165] The award may end up exceeding $1 million once interest has been factored in, though the ruling may be appealed.\n\nIn August 2016, Woods announced that he would be seeking a new golf equipment partner[166] after the news of Nike's exit from the equipment industry.[167] It was announced on January 25, 2017, that he would be signing a new club deal with TaylorMade.[168] He added the 2016 M2 driver along with the 2017 M1 fairway woods, with irons to be custom made at a later date. He also added his Scotty Cameron Newport 2 GSS, a club he used to win 13 of his 14 majors.[169] Also, in late 2016, he would add Monster Energy as his primary bag sponsor, replacing MusclePharm.[170]\n\nAccumulated wealth\n\nAccording to Golf Digest, Woods made $769,440,709 from 1996 to 2007,[171] and the magazine predicted that Woods would pass one billion dollars in earnings by 2010.[172] In 2009, Forbes confirmed that Woods was indeed the world's first athlete to earn over a billion dollars in his career, after accounting for the $10 million bonus Woods received for the FedEx Cup title.[173][174] The same year, Forbes estimated his net worth to be $600 million, making him the second richest person of color in the United States, behind only Oprah Winfrey.[175] In 2015, Woods ranked ninth in Forbes' list of world's highest-paid athletes, being the top among Asian Americans or the fourth among African Americans.[176] Woods is currently considered to be the highest-paid golfer.[177]\n\nTiger-proofing\n\nEarly in Woods' career, a small number of golf experts expressed concern about his impact on the competitiveness of the game and the public appeal of professional golf. Sportswriter Bill Lyon of Knight Ridder asked in a column, \"Isn't Tiger Woods actually bad for golf?\" (though Lyon ultimately concluded that he was not).[178] At first, some pundits feared that Woods would drive the spirit of competition out of the game of golf by making existing courses obsolete and relegating opponents to simply competing for second place each week.\n\nA related effect was measured by University of California economist Jennifer Brown, who found that other golfers scored higher when competing against Woods than when he was not in the tournament. The scores of highly skilled (exempt) golfers are nearly one stroke higher when playing against Woods. This effect was larger when he was on winning streaks and disappeared during his well-publicized slump in 2003\u201304. Brown explains the results by noting that competitors of similar skill can hope to win by increasing their level of effort, but that, when facing a \"superstar\" competitor, extra exertion does not significantly raise one's level of winning while increasing risk of injury or exhaustion, leading to reduced effort.[179]\n\nMany courses in the PGA Tour rotation (including major championship sites like Augusta National) have added yardage to their tees in an effort to reduce the advantage of long hitters like Woods, a strategy that became known as \"Tiger-Proofing\". Woods said he welcomed the change, in that adding yardage to courses did not affect his ability to win.[180]\n\nCareer achievements\n\nWoods has won 80 official PGA Tour events, including 14 majors. He is 14\u20131 when going into the final round of a major with at least a share of the lead.

He is one of five players (along with Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Gary Player, and Jack Nicklaus) to have won all four professional major championships in his career, known as the Career Grand Slam, and was the youngest to do so.[187] Woods is the only player to have won all four professional major championships in a row, accomplishing the feat in the 2000\u20132001 seasons.\n\nMajor championships\n\nWins (14)\n\n1Defeated May in three-hole playoff by 1 stroke: Woods (3-4-5=12), May (4-4-5=13)\n\n2Defeated DiMarco in a sudden-death playoff: Woods (3) and DiMarco (4).\n\n3Defeated Mediate with a par on 1st sudden death hole after 18-hole playoff was tied at even par.

After Usain Bolt and Michael Phelps, he holds the third highest number of Guinness World Records claimed by a sportsman within one discipline.[189]\n\nMost consecutive US Amateur golf titles Most US PGA Tour tournament wins in the modern era Lowest score under par in the Open golf championships Most awards for Professional Golfers' Association Tour Player of the Year Youngest winner of the golf US Masters Highest career earnings on the US Professional Golfers' Association Tour Largest margin of victory in the golf US Masters Largest margin of victory in a golf major championships Most wins of the PGA Player of the Year award Most consecutive golf Major tournaments won Highest annual earnings for a golfer Longest golf drive on the PGA Tour Lowest total score (72 holes) at the golf US Masters Longest drive in Tiger Woods PGA Tour 06 Golf, World Cup - Lowest individual score Lowest total score (first 54 holes) in the golf US Masters Highest annual earnings for an athlete (ever)\n\nPlaying style\n\nWhen Woods first joined the PGA Tour in 1996, his long drives had a large impact on the world of golf.[190][191] However, when he did not upgrade his equipment in the following years (insisting upon the use of True Temper Dynamic Gold steel-shafted clubs and smaller steel clubheads that promoted accuracy over distance),[192] many opponents caught up to him. Phil Mickelson even made a joke in 2003 about Woods using \"inferior equipment\", which did not sit well with Nike, Titleist or Woods.[193][194] During 2004, Woods finally upgraded his driver technology to a larger clubhead and graphite shaft, which, coupled with his clubhead speed, made him one of the Tour's lengthiest players off the tee once again.\n\nDespite his power advantage, Woods has always focused on developing an excellent all-around game. Although in recent years[when?] he has typically been near the bottom of the Tour rankings in driving accuracy, his iron play is generally accurate, his recovery and bunker play is very strong, and his putting (especially under pressure) is possibly his greatest asset. He is largely responsible for a shift to higher standards of athleticism amongst professional golfers, and is known for utilizing more hours of practice than most.[195][196][197]\n\nFrom mid-1993 (while he was still an amateur) until 2004, Woods worked almost exclusively with leading swing coach Butch Harmon. From mid-1997, Harmon and Woods fashioned a major redevelopment of Woods' full swing, achieving greater consistency, better distance control, and better kinesiology. The changes began to pay off in 1999.[198] From March 2004 to 2010, Woods was coached by Hank Haney, who worked on flattening his swing plane. Woods continued to win tournaments with Haney, but his driving accuracy dropped significantly. Haney resigned in May 2010 and was replaced by Sean Foley.[199]\n\nFluff Cowan served as Woods' caddie from the start of his professional career until Woods dismissed him in March 1999.[200] He was replaced by Steve Williams, who became a close friend of Woods and is often credited with helping him with key shots and putts.[201] In June 2011, Woods dismissed Williams and replaced him with friend Bryon Bell on an interim basis. Joe LaCava, a former caddie of both Fred Couples and Dustin Johnson, was hired by Woods shortly after[202] and has remained Woods' caddie since then, but he has seen limited work.\n\nEquipment\n\nAs of 2018 Tour Championship[203]:\n\nDriver: TaylorMade M3 460 (Mitsubishi Chemical Diamana D+ White Board 73TX shaft), 9.5 degrees\n\nFairway woods: TaylorMade M3 13 & 19 Degree (Mitsubishi Chemical Diamana D+ White Board 83TX shaft)\n\nIrons: TaylorMade TW Phase1 Prototype (3-PW; True Temper Dynamic Gold Tour Issue X100 shafts)\n\nWedges: TaylorMade Milled Grind (56 and 60 degrees; True Temper Dynamic Gold Tour Issue S400 shafts)\n\nPutter: Scotty Cameron Newport 2 GSS with Ping Blackout PP58 Grip\n\nBall: Bridgestone Tour B XS (with \"Tiger\" imprint)\n\nGolf glove: Nike Dri-FIT Tour glove\n\nGolf shoes: Nike TW '17 [204]\n\nDriver club cover: Frank , a plush tiger head club cover created by his mother.

In August 2007, Woods announced The Cliffs at High Carolina, a private course in the Blue Ridge Mountains near Asheville, North Carolina.[224] After a groundbreaking in November 2008, the project suffered cash flow problems and suspended construction.[222] A third course, in Punta Brava, Mexico, was announced in October 2008, but incurred delays due to issues with permits and an environmental impact study.[222][225] Construction on the Punta Brava course has not yet begun.[222]\n\nThese projects have encountered problems that have been attributed to factors that include overly optimistic estimates of their value, declines throughout the global economy (particularly the U.S. crash in home prices), and the decreased appeal and marketability of Woods following his 2009 infidelity scandal.[222]\n\nWritings\n\nWoods wrote a golf instruction column for Golf Digest magazine from 1997 to February 2011.[226] In 2001 he wrote a best-selling golf instruction book, How I Play Golf, which had the largest print run of any golf book for its first edition, 1.5 million copies.[227] In March 2017, he published a memoir, The 1997 Masters: My Story, co-authored by Lorne Rubenstein, which focuses on his first Masters win.[228]\n\nPersonal life\n\nMarriage and children\n\nIn November 2003, Woods became engaged to Elin Nordegren, a Swedish former model and daughter of former minister of migration Barbro Holmberg and radio journalist Thomas Nordegren.[229] They were introduced during The Open Championship in 2001 by Swedish golfer Jesper Parnevik, who had employed her as an au pair. They married on October 5, 2004, at the Sandy Lane resort in Barbados, and lived at Isleworth, a community in Windermere, a suburb of Orlando, Florida.[230][231] In 2006, they purchased a $39-million estate in Jupiter Island, Florida, and began constructing a 10,000-square-foot home; Woods moved there in 2010 following the couple's divorce.[5][231]\n\nWoods and Nordegren's first child was a girl born in 2007, whom they named Sam Alexis Woods. Woods chose the name because his own father had always called him Sam.[232] Their son, Charlie Axel Woods, was born in 2009.[233]\n\nInfidelity scandal and fallout\n\nIn November 2009, the National Enquirer published a story claiming that Woods had had an extramarital affair with New York City nightclub manager Rachel Uchitel, who denied the claim.[234][235] Two days later, around 2:30 a.m. on November 27, Woods was driving from his Florida mansion in his Cadillac Escalade SUV when he collided with a fire hydrant, a tree, and several hedges near his home.[236] He was treated for minor facial lacerations and received a ticket for careless driving.[236][237] Following intense media speculation about the cause of the accident, Woods released a statement on his website and took sole responsibility for the accident, calling it a \"private matter\" and crediting his wife for helping him from the car.[238][239] On November 30, Woods announced that he would not be appearing at his own charity golf tournament, the Chevron World Challenge, nor any other tournaments in 2009, due to his injuries.[240]\n\nOn December 2, following Us Weekly's previous day reporting of a purported mistress and subsequent release of a voicemail message allegedly left by Woods for the woman,[241] Woods released a further statement. He admitted \"transgressions\" and apologized to \"all of those who have supported [him] over the years\", while reiterating his and his family's right to privacy.[235][242] Over the next few days, more than a dozen women claimed in various media outlets to have had affairs with Woods.[11] On December 11, he released a third statement admitting to infidelity and apologizing again, as well as announcing that he would be taking \"an indefinite break from professional golf.\"[11]\n\nIn the days and months following Woods's admission of multiple infidelities, several companies re-evaluated their relationships with him. Accenture, AT&T, Gatorade and General Motors completely ended their sponsorship deals, while Gillette suspended advertising featuring Woods.[98][243][244] TAG Heuer dropped Woods from advertising in December 2009 and officially ended their deal when his contract expired in August 2011.[98] Golf Digest suspended Woods's monthly column beginning with the February 2010 issue.[245] In contrast, Nike continued to support Woods, as did Electronic Arts, which was working with Woods on the game Tiger Woods PGA Tour Online.[246] A December 2009 study estimated the shareholder loss caused by Woods's affairs to be between $5 billion and $12 billion.[247]\n\nOn February 19, 2010, Woods gave a televised statement in which he said he had undertaken a 45-day therapy program beginning at the end of December. He again apologized for his actions. \"I thought I could get away with whatever I wanted to,\" he said. \"I felt that I had worked hard my entire life and deserved to enjoy all the temptations around me. I felt I was entitled. Thanks to money and fame, I didn't have to go far to find them. I was wrong. I was foolish.\" He said he did not know yet when he would be returning to golf.[97][248] He announced a few weeks later on March 16 that he would play in the 2010 Masters Tournament on April 8.[249]\n\nAfter seven years of marriage, Woods and his wife Elin divorced on August 23, 2010.[250]\n\n2017 arrest\n\nOn May 29, 2017, Woods was arrested near his Jupiter Island, Florida, home by the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office at about 3:00 a.m. EDT for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. He was asleep in his car, which was stationary in a traffic lane with its engine running. He later stated that he was taking prescription drugs and did not realize how they might interact together.[251][252][253] On July 3, 2017, Woods tweeted that he had completed an out-of-state intensive program to tackle an unspecified issue.[254] On August 9, 2017, Woods, who skipped his arraignment,[255] entered a not guilty plea through his attorney Douglas Duncan and agreed to take part in a first-time DUI offender program and attend another arraignment on October 25.[256]\n\nAt a hearing on October 27, 2017, Woods pleaded guilty to reckless driving. He received a year of probation, was fined $250, and ordered to undergo 50 hours of community service along with regular drug tests. He was not allowed to drink alcohol during the probation, and if he violates the probation he will be sentenced to 90 days in jail with an additional $500 fine.[257]\n\nOther pursuits\n\nWoods shoots a handgun at a shooting range outside San Diego.\n\nWoods was raised as a Buddhist, and he actively practiced his faith from childhood until well into his adult, professional golf career.[258] In a 2000 article, Woods was quoted as saying that he \"believes in Buddhism... not every aspect, but most of it.\"[259] He has attributed his deviations and infidelity to his losing track of Buddhism. He said, \"Buddhism teaches me to stop following every impulse and to learn restraint. Obviously I lost track of what I was taught.\"[260]\n\nWoods is registered as an independent voter.[261] In January 2009, Woods delivered a speech commemorating the military at the We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial.[262][263] In April 2009, Woods visited the White House while promoting the golf tournament he hosts, the AT&T National.[264] In December 2016 and again in November 2017, Woods played golf with President Donald Trump at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach.[265]\n\nWoods underwent laser eye surgery in 1999. Before this surgery, he was severely myopic, his eyesight having a rating of 11 diopters. The surgery was successful (it has meant that he does not need to wear glasses or use contact lenses),[266] as he immediately started winning tour events. He received money from TLC Laser Eye Centers to endorse them.[267] In 2007, he had further laser eye surgery when his vision began to deteriorate again.[268]\n\nOn March 18, 2013, Woods announced that he and Olympic gold medal skier Lindsey Vonn were dating.[269] They split up in May 2015.[270]\n\nSee also\n\nReferences"}

At present, the reality TV star is already dating a much younger guy named Younes Bendjima. The host, on the other hand, is reportedly dating Sofia Richie. But before the two settled with their respective partners, Disick and Kardashian both struggled when they were still together.\n\nLast year, Kardashian appeared on the \u201cEllen Show\u201d to talk about her ex-boyfriend. Host Ellen DeGeneres asked her if she is still seeing Disick, and she said, \u201cWell, we\u2019re not together.\u201d The eldest daughter of Kris Jenner also called Disick \u201cfamily\u201d since they share three beautiful kids together.\n\nBut while they were still in a relationship, Disick battled his alcohol addiction. Photos of him canoodling with another woman also went viral at the time that he was still dating Kardashian. For a time, Disick also stopped drinking, but his old partying ways resurfaced last summer.\n\nIn July, he was photographed partying at different locations and with different women including Bella Thorne. However, Thorne clarified at that time that she and Disick are nothing more than friends.

{"label": true, "txt": "How do I know him? Where have I seen him? The Man in the Hat looked familiar, I thought, as I peered over at him a second time. It was Christmas Eve 2017. My family and I were about to be seated at a quaint restaurant in Manhattan\u2019s West Village. We had just come from Gramercy Park\u2014on the one night each year when the exclusive park (accessible only to nearby residents with special keys) opens its gates to outsiders. There had been carols. People had sung with abandon. In short, it was a magical night. I was happy. Amid the glow of candles and soft lighting, I strained to look again at the Man in the Hat. He was part of a small group that had just exited the main dining room. They were now gathering their belongings, likely vacating what was to be our table. And then it clicked. He looks just like . . . no, couldn\u2019t be. Could it? A student of Karma, I found myself seizing the moment. Whereas a decade ago I would have turned and fled the restaurant at the prospect of being in the same place as this man, many years of personal-counseling work (both trauma-specific and spiritual) had led me to a place where I now embrace opportunities to move into spaces that allow me to break out of old patterns of retreat or denial. At the same moment I stepped toward the Man in the Hat and began to ask, \u201cYou\u2019re not . . . ?,\u201d he stepped toward me with a warm, incongruous smile and said, \u201cLet me introduce myself. I\u2019m Ken Starr.\u201d An introduction was indeed necessary. This was, in fact, the first time I had met him. I found myself shaking his hand even as I struggled to decipher the warmth he evinced. After all, in 1998, this was the independent prosecutor who had investigated me, a former White House intern; the man whose staff, accompanied by a group of F.B.I. agents (Starr himself was not there), had hustled me into a hotel room near the Pentagon and informed me that unless I cooperated with them I could face 27 years in prison. This was the man who had turned my 24-year-old life into a living hell in his effort to investigate and prosecute President Bill Clinton on charges that would eventually include obstruction of justice and lying under oath\u2014lying about having maintained a long-term extramarital relationship with me. Ken Starr asked me several times if I was \u201cdoing O.K.\u201d A stranger might have surmised from his tone that he had actually worried about me over the years. His demeanor, almost pastoral, was somewhere between avuncular and creepy. He kept touching my arm and elbow, which made me uncomfortable. I turned and introduced him to my family. Bizarre as it may sound, I felt determined, then and there, to remind him that, 20 years before, he and his team of prosecutors hadn\u2019t hounded and terrorized just me but also my family\u2014threatening to prosecute my mom (if she didn\u2019t disclose the private confidences I had shared with her), hinting that they would investigate my dad\u2019s medical practice, and even deposing my aunt, with whom I was eating dinner that night. And all because the Man in the Hat, standing in front of me, had decided that a frightened young woman could be useful in his larger case against the president of the United States. Understandably, I was a bit thrown. (It was also confusing for me to see \u201cKen Starr\u201d as a human being. He was there, after all, with what appeared to be his family.) I finally gathered my wits about me\u2014after an internal command of Get it together. \u201cThough I wish I had made different choices back then,\u201d I stammered, \u201cI wish that you and your office had made different choices, too.\u201d In hindsight, I later realized, I was paving the way for him to apologize. But he didn\u2019t. He merely said, with the same inscrutable smile, \u201cI know. It was unfortunate.\u201d It had been nearly 20 years since 1998. The next month would mark the 20th anniversary of the Starr investigation expanding to include me. The 20th anniversary of my name becoming public for the first time. And the 20th anniversary of an annus horribilis that would almost end Clinton\u2019s presidency, consume the nation\u2019s attention, and alter the course of my life. By Jeffrey Markowitz/Sygma/Getty Images.\n\nIf I have learned anything since then, it is that you cannot run away from who you are or from how you\u2019ve been shaped by your experiences. Instead, you must integrate your past and pres\u00adent. As Salman Rushdie observed after the fatwa was issued against him, \u201cThose who do not have power over the story that dominates their lives, power to retell it, rethink it, deconstruct it, joke about it, and change it as times change, truly are powerless, because they cannot think new thoughts.\u201d I have been working toward this realization for years. I have been trying to find that power\u2014a particularly Sisyphean task for a person who has been gaslighted. To be blunt, I was diagnosed several years ago with post-traumatic stress disorder, mainly from the ordeal of having been publicly outed and ostracized back then. My trauma expedition has been long, arduous, painful, and expensive. And it\u2019s not over. (I like to joke that my tombstone will read, MUTATIS MUTANDIS\u2014\u201cWith Changes Being Made.\u201d) I\u2019ve lived for so long in the House of Gaslight, clinging to my experiences as they unfolded in my 20s. But as I find myself reflecting on what happened, I\u2019ve also come to understand how my trauma has been, in a way, a microcosm of a larger, national one. Both clinically and observationally, something fundamental changed in our society in 1998, and it is changing again as we enter the second year of the Trump presidency in a post-Cosby-Ailes-O\u2019Reilly-Weinstein-Spacey-Whoever-Is-Next world. The Starr investigation and the subsequent impeachment trial of Bill Clinton amounted to a crisis that Americans arguably endured collectively\u2014some of us, obviously, more than others. It was a shambolic morass of a scandal that dragged on for 13 months, and many politicians and citizens became collateral damage\u2014along with the nation\u2019s capacity for mercy, measure, and perspective. Certainly, the events of that year did not constitute a war or a terrorist attack or a financial recession. They didn\u2019t constitute a natural catastrophe or a medical pandemic or what experts refer to as \u201cBig T\u201d traumas. But something had shifted nonetheless. And even after the Senate voted in 1999 to acquit President Clinton on two articles of impeachment, we could not escape the sense of upheaval and partisan division that lingered, settled in, and stayed. Maybe you remember or have heard stories about how \u201cthe scandal\u201d saturated television and radio; newspapers, magazines, and the Internet; Saturday Night Live and the Sunday-morning opinion programs; dinner-party conversation and watercooler discussions; late-night monologues and political talk shows (definitely the talk shows). In The Washington Post alone, there were 125 articles written about this crisis\u2014in just the first 10 days. Many parents felt compelled to discuss sexual issues with their children earlier than they might have wanted to. They had to explain why \u201clying\u201d\u2014even if the president did it\u2014was not acceptable behavior. The press was navigating unexplored terrain, too. Anonymous sources seemed to emerge almost daily with new (and often false or meaningless) revelations. There was a new commingling of traditional news, talk radio, tabloid television, and online rumor mills (fake news, anyone?). With the introduction of the World Wide Web (in 1992-93) and two new cable news networks (Fox News and MSNBC in 1996), the lines began to blur between fact and opinion, news and gossip, private lives and public shaming. The Internet had become such a propulsive force driving the flow of information that when the Republican-led Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives decided to publish Ken Starr\u2019s commission\u2019s \u201cfindings\u201d online\u2014just two days after he had delivered them\u2014it meant that (for me personally) every adult with a modem could instantaneously peruse a copy and learn about my private conversations, my personal musings (lifted from my home computer), and, worse yet, my sex life. Americans young and old, red and blue, watched day and night. We watched a beleaguered president and the embattled and often disenchanted members of his administration as they protected him. We watched a First Lady and First Daughter move through the year with grit and grace. We watched a special prosecutor get pilloried (though some thought he deserved it). We watched an American family\u2014my family\u2014as a mother was forced to testify against her child and as a father was forced to take his daughter to be fingerprinted at the Federal Building. We watched the wholesale dissection of a young, unknown woman\u2014me\u2014who, due to legal quarantine, was unable to speak out on her own behalf. How, then, to get a handle, today, on what exactly happened back then?\n\nOne useful viewpoint is that of cognitive linguist George Lakoff. In his book Moral Politics: What Conservatives Know That Liberals Don\u2019t, Lakoff observes that the connective fiber of our country is often best represented through the metaphor of family: e.g., \u201cour Founding Fathers,\u201d \u201cUncle Sam,\u201d the concept of sending our sons and daughters to war. Lakoff goes on to argue that, \u201cfor conservatives, the nation is conceptualized (implicitly and unconsciously) as a Strict Father family and, for liberals, as a Nurturant Parent family.\u201d Addressing the scandal itself, he asserts that Clinton was widely perceived as \u201cthe naughty child\u201d and that, in line with the filial metaphor, \u201ca family matter [had turned] into an affair of state.\u201d Thus, in many ways, the crack in the foundation of the presidency was also a crack in our foundation at home. Moreover, the nature of the violation\u2014an extramarital relationship\u2014struck at the heart of one of humanity\u2019s most complicated moral issues: infidelity. (You\u2019ll forgive me if I leave that topic right there.) The result, I believe, was that in 1998 the person to whom we would typically turn for reassurance and comfort during a national crisis was remote and unavailable. The country, at that stage, had no consistent, Rooseveltian voice of calm or reason or empathy to make sense of the chaos. Instead, our Nurturer in Chief, because of his own actions as much as the subterfuge of his enemies, was a figurative \u201cabsent father.\u201d As a society, we went through this together. And ever since, the scandal has had an epigenetic quality, as if our cultural DNA has slowly been altered to ensure its longevity. If you can believe it, there has been at least one significant reference in the press to that unfortunate spell in our history every day for the past 20 years. Every. Single. Day. The fog of 1998 has lodged in our consciousness for many reasons. The Clintons have remained pivotal political figures on the global stage. Their disparagement has been vigorously abetted by \u201cthis vast right-wing conspiracy,\u201d as Hil\u00adla\u00adry Clinton famously put it. And the Clinton presidency segued into a bitter electoral deadlock: the contested Bush v. Gore showdown, which would usher in an era so turbulent that it would leave the lessons of the Clinton years altogether murky. In succession came the unthinkable (the attacks of September 11, 2001), protracted conflicts (the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan), the Great Recession, a state of perpetual gridlock in Washington, and then the daily bedlam central to Trumpism. No matter how these subsequent events dwarfed the impeachment and subsumed our attention, maybe, just maybe, the long, unimpeded derivation of this drama, ever since, is partly the result of 1998 having been a year of unremitting crisis that we all endured but never actually resolved\u2014a low-grade collective trauma, perhaps? I discussed this idea with psychologist Jack Saul, founding director of New York\u2019s International Trauma Studies Program and author of Collective Trauma, Collective Healing. \u201cCollective trauma,\u201d he told me, \u201cusually refers to the shared injuries to a population\u2019s social ecology due to a major catastrophe or chronic oppression, poverty, and disease. While the events of 1998 in the United States do not fit neatly into such a definition, they may have led to some of the features we often associate with collective traumas: social rupturing and a profound sense of distress, the challenging of long-held assumptions about the world and national identity, a constricted public narrative, and a process of scapegoating and dehumanization.\u201d Until recently (thank you, Harvey Weinstein), historians hadn\u2019t really had the perspective to fully process and acknowledge that year of shame and spectacle. And as a culture, we still haven\u2019t properly examined it. Re-framed it. Integrated it. And transformed it. My hope, given the two dec\u00adades that have passed, is that we are now at a stage where we can untangle the complexities and context (maybe even with a little compassion), which might help lead to an eventual healing\u2014and a systemic transformation. As Haruki Murakami has written, \u201cWhen you come out of the storm you won\u2019t be the same person who walked in. That\u2019s what this storm\u2019s all about.\u201d Who were we then? Who are we now?\n\n\u2018I\u2019m so sorry you were so alone.\u201d Those seven words undid me. They were written in a recent private exchange I had with one of the brave women leading the #MeToo movement. Somehow, coming from her\u2014a recognition of sorts on a deep, soulful level\u2014they landed in a way that cracked me open and brought me to tears. Yes, I had received many letters of support in 1998. And, yes (thank God!), I had my family and friends to support me. But by and large I had been alone. So. Very. Alone. Publicly Alone\u2014abandoned most of all by the key figure in the crisis, who actually knew me well and intimately. That I had made mistakes, on that we can all agree. But swimming in that sea of Aloneness was terrifying. Isolation is such a powerful tool to the subjugator. And yet I don\u2019t believe I would have felt so isolated had it all happened today. One of the most inspiring aspects of this newly energized movement is the sheer number of women who have spoken up in support of one another. And the volume in numbers has translated into volume of public voice. Historically, he who shapes the story (and it is so often a he) creates \u201cthe truth.\u201d But this collective rise in decibel level has provided a resonance for women\u2019s narratives. If the Internet was a b\u00eate noire to me in 1998, its stepchild\u2014social media\u2014has been a savior for millions of women today (notwithstanding all the cyberbullying, online harassment, doxing, and slut-shaming). Virtually anyone can share her or his #MeToo story and be instantly welcomed into a tribe. In addition, the democratizing potential of the Internet to open up support networks and penetrate what used to be closed circles of power is something that was unavailable to me back then. Power, in that case, remained in the hands of the president and his minions, the Congress, the prosecutors, and the press. There are many more women and men whose voices and stories need to be heard before mine. (There are even some people who feel my White House experiences don\u2019t have a place in this movement, as what transpired between Bill Clinton and myself was not sexual assault, although we now recognize that it constituted a gross abuse of power.) And yet, everywhere I have gone for the past few months, I\u2019ve been asked about it. My response has been the same: I am in awe of the sheer courage of the women who have stood up and begun to confront entrenched beliefs and institutions. But as for me, my history, and how I fit in personally? I\u2019m sorry to say I don\u2019t have a definitive answer yet on the meaning of all of the events that led to the 1998 investigation; I am unpacking and reprocessing what happened to me. Over and over and over again. For two dec\u00adades, I have been working on myself, my trauma, and my healing. And, naturally, I have grappled with the rest of the world\u2019s interpretations and Bill Clinton\u2019s re-interpretations of what happened. But in truth, I have done this at arm\u2019s length. There have been so many barriers to this place of self-reckoning. The reason this is difficult is that I\u2019ve lived for such a long time in the House of Gaslight, clinging to my experiences as they unfolded in my 20s and railing against the untruths that painted me as an unstable stalker and Servicer in Chief. An inability to deviate from the internal script of what I actually experienced left little room for re-evaluation; I cleaved to what I \u201cknew.\u201d So often have I struggled with my own sense of agency versus victimhood. (In 1998, we were living in times in which women\u2019s sexuality was a marker of their agency\u2014\u201cowning desire.\u201d And yet, I felt that if I saw myself as in any way a victim, it would open the door to choruses of: \u201cSee, you did merely service him.\u201d) What it means to confront a long-held belief (one clung to like a life raft in the middle of the ocean) is to challenge your own perceptions and allow the pentimento painting that is hidden beneath the surface to emerge and be seen in the light of a new day."}

Although terribly unfortunate, this is an understandable part of the behavior of addicts on their journey to recovery. Deception, dishonesty and denial are hallmarks of addiction. It tears families apart and certainly creates levels of complexities when we produce these important shows. None of this will deter the Dr. Phil show from it\u2019s commitment to continue to educate and inform the public about the worsening epidemic of addiction.\u201d\n\nMartin Greenberg \u2014 the show\u2019s director of professional affairs \u2014 described Herzog\u2019s claims and others made by former guests and their families to STAT and The Boston Globe as \u201cabsolutely, unequivocally untrue.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe do not do that with this guest or any other,\u201d Greenberg told STAT of Herzog\u2019s account, later adding, that Herzog was \u201cmedically supervised the entire time\u201d by personnel from an unnamed treatment center during his taping schedule.\n\n(Steve Thomason, the executive director of the center Herzog attended in Texas, claims no one from that facility monitored Herzog in L.A., STAT and The Boston Globe report, explaining that doing so would violate their licenses).\n\n\u201cAddicts are notorious for lying, deflecting and trivializing,\u201d Greenberg added. \u201cBut, if they are at risk when they arrive, then they were at risk before they arrived. The only change is they are one step closer to getting help, typically help they could not have even come close to affording.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the report, families of former guests \u2014 like Marianne Smith (whose niece Jordan appeared on the show) and Joelle King-Parrish (whose pregnant daughter Kaitlin appeared on the show) claimed that producers encouraged them to go to Skid Row in Los Angeles to find drugs, which the King-Parrishs did. They also both claimed that the show did not provide any medical assistance as they awaited taping.\n\n\u201cWe could go on and talk about Jordan L. or ten others. Same reality. All had medical supervision,\u201d Greenberg said in denial, adding that Kaitlin\u2019s mother had allegedly \u201cagreed to be 100 percent responsible for managing her daughter\u2019s health and possible withdrawal\u201d and the individual who filmed the Skid Row trip, \u201csimply documented the natural behavior she observed, which would have occurred whether she was there or not.\u201d\n\nNot all reports were bad, though. Some interviewed for the story praised McGraw and the show for getting them the help they need, like former heroin addict Niki Dietrich.\n\n\u201cFew people contact us just to let us know how well things are going,\u201d the show wrote in a statement to STAT and The Globe. \u201cThe fact you can \u2018cherry pick\u2019 three, or thirty, or three hundred guests for that matter, who seek to blame others for their plight or struggle in life, is not the least bit surprising.\u201d"}

Since then, at nearly every event there's a notable gown-and-gam pairing.The runways also have been full of leggy, lengthy dresses (witness Giambattista Valli\u2019s spring 2017 haute couture show and Christian Siriano's fall 2017 ready-to-wear).\n\nIn fact, long, lean, tan and toned legs have become such a must-have accessory that workouts are being tailor-made for them.\n\nCelebrity trainer Danny Musico says it\u2019s the most common request he\u2019s gotten from his actress and model clients. And Musico should know, the former super middleweight boxing champion trains Hilary Swank, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jessica Simpson, Demi Moore, Mark Wahlberg, Jamie Foxx, Justin Bieber and Toby Maguire for roles and real life.\n\nFor the toned but not bulky legs his clients have been craving, Musico, who has also spent his fair share in front of the camera playing a detective on Law and Order for seven years and himself on Entourage, recommends a series of exercises and fast interval workouts, burning the fat but keeping the lean muscle definition.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to a dress with a high slit, it\u2019s all about the lines of the leg and getting definition without bulking up.\u201d says Musico, who works out of the Sixty Hotel in Beverly Hills. \u201cTo achieve that, it\u2019s about engaging the core and the lines of the side of the leg.\u201d\n\nFor what he calls \u201crunway legs,\u201d Musico recommends leg overs, which are done by placing both hands and one knee on a bench. Swing the free leg over in an arc-like motion from side to side over the bench.\n\nFor those sought-after \u201cred-carpet legs,\" Musico puts his clients on a machine called the Frog Trainer, an apparatus with four wheels that requires an insane amount of core strength to draw the lower body up toward to top of the body, forming a pike-like position.\n\nA video posted by 2x World Boxing Champion (@dannymusico) on Feb 9, 2017 at 4:27pm PST\n\nMusico also uses an exercise bike called a Realryder, which, unlike a typical stationary bike, can articulate to bend at the handles by utilizing and toning the side body while pedaling to define the legs.\n\nThe fat-burning portion of Musico\u2019s workouts are intense, to say the least (he also is an off-season strength and conditioning coach for the Los Angeles Rams football team), but what he recommends as an integral part of the leg-toning regimen. We\u2019re guessing that a few grueling workouts are a small price to pay for the celebrities who choose to show a significant amount of leg on the red carpet on Oscar Sunday."}

Now, months later, Francia Raisa has opened up about her tough recovery from the surgery.\n\nBack in 2015, Gomez revealed that she suffers from lupus. And since then, she\u2019s had to take several breaks to focus on her health. The surgery happened in the summer of 2017. And while both friends seem to be doing well now, it certainly seems like the overall experience was pretty scary. In November, Gomez attended the Lupus Research Alliance Annual Gala, where she opened up about her struggle, saying that \u201cit actually got to a point where it was life-or-death\u201d before her surgery. \u201cThankfully, one of my best friends gave me her kidney and it was the ultimate gift of life.

Two months, I couldn\u2019t do anything active. All I could do was walk. That was very hard for me and I have a dog and every day the thing I look forward to is drinking my coffee and walking and I couldn\u2019t do that. It was really, really hard.\u201d\n\nFrancia Raisa also revealed that Gomez felt guilty for putting her in the situation, but that the two ultimately grew closer because of it.\n\n\"It was a big surgery. She felt bad about even having me do that because we are just friends, I am not her family or anything. Well, I am now.

It seems that the silver lining to the situation was the bonding between not just Raisa and Gomez, but their families as well.\n\nShortly after Gomez revealed her surgery on social media, her mom shared an emotional message of her own. She posted a photo of Gomez and Raisa on Instagram, saying, \u201cSelena gained a kidney, I was able to keep my little girl, but I also gained another daughter.\u201d\n\nFrancia Raisa\u2019s interview will air on Harry on Monday, February 19th.

And she was amazing and such a leader,\u201d Lowes says of Nzingha Stewart. \u201cWhat was great about her is that she\u2019s a director that doesn\u2019t take a billion takes, so I knew I could really go balls to the wall and leave it all on the dance floor three to five times but not have to do it 30 times.\u201d\n\nRelated TV\u2019s Most Meaningful Deaths of 2018 Broadway Review: 'American Son' Starring Kerry Washington\n\n\u201cGood People\u201d revealed Rowan kept Quinn in a bunker, where she pleaded for her life, clutching her pregnant stomach and saying that in B613 it was supposed to be \u201cmothers and children first, that\u2019s the rule\u201d \u2014 but then railed against Rowan for his inability to see that Olivia would never trade and that doomed both her and her unborn daughter.\n\n\u201cThe stakes couldn\u2019t be higher,\u201d Lowes says of \u201cGood People.\u201d\n\nWhen Olivia showed up at Rowan\u2019s and the father-daughter duo engaged in a standoff over the fact that he should shoot her but couldn\u2019t, Quinn used a hairpin to unshackle her handcuffs. She was able to surprise Rowan when he came down to the bunker, and she attacked him \u2014 and this time when she begged him not to kill her until after her baby was born, it turned out that \u201cmother and children first\u201d reminder sunk in.\n\nGetting so physical while pregnant was \u201chorrifying\u201d at first for Lowes, but when it came to the day of shooting the actual scene, she shares she felt \u201cvery well taken care of.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had a medic on set at all times [and] we had an OB on set who was instructing me on how to do everything really safely, which was incredible,\u201d Lowes says. \u201cWe had our stunt coordinator \u2014 I had a stunt double \u2014 and we took things really slow. I felt very safe.\u201d\n\nShortly after the fake shooting, Quinn went into labor and had the baby with a little help from Rowan, his salesman friend who was previously a war medic, as well assome hallucinations of her friends.\n\n\u201cThe craziest part of the episode was me actually being nine and a half months pregnant with a blanket over my knees, and they put a real baby in between my legs and pulled the baby out like it was really happening. And I was like, \u2018Oh my God, guys, this is going to really be happening to me in a few weeks!'\u201d Lowes says. \u201cThey had a real baby and a fake baby \u2014 the real baby so they could get a cry and the fake was covered in grape jelly and cottage cheese. But that\u2019s how they make it look like a baby was just born.\u201d\n\nThe new mother and daughter moved into Liv\u2019s old room in Rowan\u2019s house to lay low and allow Olivia to continue to believe she was dead \u2014 so she wouldn\u2019t come looking for her to actually kill her.\n\n\u201cNzingha was very much [about] finding moments where \u2014 especially when the baby comes and he had bought all of the clothes for her \u2014 Quinn is filling this huge void for Papa Pope,\u201d Lowes says. \u201cAnd similarly, Quinn didn\u2019t have a father either. And then they are so allied in the end in that they both followed the B613 rules, which is that they put a woman and pregnancy before anything else.\u201d\n\nLowes says Rowan and Quinn are now bonded because they \u201cdefinitely need each other at the moment,\u201d and subsequent episodes of \u201cScandal\u201d will dive into how that plays out. Last the show left Rowan in present day, Charlie (George Newbern) was attacking him over the baby he found in his house, demanding to know whose it was. Lowes says the eventual family reunion between Charlie and Quinn is \u201cnot what you\u2019d expect\u201d \u2014 not even for \u201cScandal.\u201d\n\nAs for whether or not Quinn and Rowan will work together to try to take down Olivia, and soon bring Charlie into that fold, Lowes would only say \u201call the loyalties and family dynamics\u201d would unfold soon. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s like one we\u2019ve seen on television before,\u201d she says.\n\nBut while Quinn was once super loyal to Olivia and in many ways was even \u201cwaiting around for her to save\u201d her while she was down in that bunker, after overhearing Olivia allow her and her baby\u2019s murder, her feelings toward her former mentor are \u201cvery complicated.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard for her to wrap her head around the fact that Olivia\u2019s responsible for blowing up the plane with that young girl on it. I think it\u2019s very hard for her to admit that the Olivia she knows and loves is not here right now,\u201d Lowes says. \u201cI think the line is, \u2018Olivia\u2019s a bitch\u2019 and I think that\u2019s way too light, honestly. I love the moment because how do you find the words to describe someone that is responsible for killing you and your unborn child and being fine for it for the Republic? I don\u2019t know how a relationship comes back from it, I really don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nEven after such an emotional fake-out death episode, Lowes doesn\u2019t have strong feelings about whether or not Quinn survives the series, which is ramping up for its finale in April.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been such a cog in this huge wheel for seven years, and I\u2019m just very used to Shonda making the best decisions for the characters,\u201d Lowes says. \u201cI know Quinn is mine, but she\u2019s also hers, and I just feel like whatever she wants for her is what I will come to terms with.\u201d\n\n\u201cScandal\u201d airs on Thursdays at 9 p.m. on ABC."}

{"label": true, "txt": "[This story contains spoilers from the series finale of ABC's Scandal, \"Over a Cliff.\"]\n\nThe Gladiators have left their arena.\n\nOn Thursday, ABC and Shonda Rhimes closed up Olivia Pope and Associates for good as Scandal wrapped its seven-season run with a series finale that explored the ramifications of going public with the existence of black-ops group B613 and the ultimate corruption that comes with the thirst for power and the Oval Office.\n\nThe series finale, fittingly called \"Over a Cliff\" and written by Rhimes, followed the Gladiators all standing in the light to tell the truth about what they've done over their years of back-room deals and misdeeds to protect the Republic (and their own inner-circle of power). As expected, the finale featured a couple of familiar faces, resolved the B613 case and left some things open for interpretation.\n\nUltimately, Attorney General David Rosen (Josh Malina) \u2014 aka the most innocent person in D.C. whose hat was the whitest among everyone on the show \u2014 would pay the price for everything and was killed off. In the end, it was Cyrus (Jeff Perry) \u2014 the vice president of the United States \u2014 who killed David as he proved yet again that he would do anything to make the Oval Office his own in a storyline that Scandal has followed since its start. The series has always explored how the Oval Office and lust for power corrupts those who come near it, and Cyrus killing David illustrated how far he would go to get the highest office in the country. As for Cyrus, Olivia demands his resignation and he willingly agrees as he acknowledges that the things that he has done in his lust for power are demons from which he can never escape.\n\n\"It's always been my contention that the Oval Office, in our show, was a place that corrupted anybody who came near it and the closer you came, the more corrupt it made you and the more damaged it made you,\" Rhimes told reporters, including THR, ahead of the finale. \"Olivia started out as the character that we knew who has very much believed in how important this particular kind of power was and how molding it and being a part of it was \u2014 and we watched her, like everybody else, become absolutely corrupted by it, and make all the same mistakes that everybody else makes to get what she wants from it.\"\n\nThat reveal capped a final season that focused largely on how Olivia (Kerry Washington), who assumed control of B613 in the season six finale, had to fight her way back into the light and stand in the sun of what's right and, most importantly, who she really is at her core. Given the chance to flee by her father Rowan (Joe Morton), the one-time head of B613, Olivia opted instead to tell the truth and find her moral center again. Rowan, as it turns out, shockingly opted to do the same and testified that he created B613 and did so in a response to a need: because of white men whose privilege left the Republic in a state of neglect. Rowan confesses to his work fixing elections, acts of terrorism and more \u2014 but he did so for a reason. \"I am responsible for the fact that this nation still stands,\" he testifies. \"I wake up every morning and I make America great.\" Rowan's final monologue is a larger statement about race in America and that the white men who run the country were ultimately controlled by a black man. Rowan's testimony brings Jake (Scott Foley) down as he takes the fall for B613.\n\n\"One of the things that Olivia says in the penultimate episode is this idea of standing up and being somebody who puts everything out in the open is important,\" Rhimes told reporters, including THR, ahead of the series ender. \"Whether or not everybody pays for what they've done, I don't know that that's what the finale is about as much as it's about seeing what happens once that choice has been made.\"\n\n\n\nRhimes reiterated that she has always been more \"Team Olivia\" than any other romantic pairing for her D.C. fixer and the finale would serve to complete Olivia's \"evolution\" from the time viewers met her \u2014 when she'd already rigged a presidential election \u2014 to what happens after she finds her moral center again this season.\" So post-B613, did Olivia wind up with her fairy tale ending with Fitz and a lifetime of making jam in Vermont? The end of the series featured Olivia's portrait in the National Portrait Gallery \u2014 leaving viewers to decide for themselves if Olivia would wind up becoming president or was rewarded for her role in cleaning up D.C.'s corruption and becoming the ultimate fixer. (A nice touch: Rhimes' daughter, Harper, was the young girl left looking up at the portrait, which said \"We the People\" along its side.)\n\nAs Rhimes warned, the finale also left that and a few other storylines open for viewers to interpret on their own as Scandal jumped forward following the conclusion of the B613 trial. Rhimes and producers have no immediate plans of discussing how the series ultimately ended and intentionally wanted to leave the audience to determine the show's ultimate takeaway about politics in D.C. (Rhimes noted that the finale was more about completing Olivia's journey than making a statement about backroom dealings in D.C.)\n\nThe finale also left viewers to decide if Olivia and Fitz (Tony Goldwyn) got their happy ending and life of jam-making in Vermont.\n\nThat said, here's a look at where everyone wound up.\n\n\u2022 Olivia (Washington): Cleaned up D.C., stood in the sun and was happily her own person. The ending also implied that the path was clear for a romantic relationship with Fitz, free of B613 and secrets. Rhimes' ending also reiterated a theme that she has explored in the past: that women do not need a man to be happy, though her romantic path to Fitz remained open. Free from working in Washington, Olivia is left to do whatever she wants as she turns her back on D.C.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Fitz (Goldwyn): The former president still has his foundation and likely now has an open path to a romantic future with the love of his life: Olivia. What's more: his legacy is left untarnished. He becomes Marcus' first backer in what could be his eventual run for office.\n\n\u2022 Mellie (Young): Cleared from all wrong-doing, Mellie remained president \u2014 with a romantic relationship with Marcus. What's more, she made gun control central to her platform. Olivia winds up telling Mellie that she has always been able to stand on her own two feet and leaves her to run the country \u2014 without her.\n\n\u2022 Cyrus (Jeff Perry): Resigns as vice president of the United States and confesses that he can't ever escape from the sins he has committed in his thirst for power.\n\n\u2022 Abby (Darby Stanchfield): Lost the love of her life in David Rosen. Abby's ending was the most open-ended, though it's likely she wound up remaining at work for Quinn Perkins and Associates.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Quinn (Katie Lowes): Got her happy ending: Married Charlie and is happy with their child \u2014 and running Quinn Perkins and Associates.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Huck (Guillermo Diaz): Remains by Abby's side as she grieves for David.\n\n\u2022 Jake (Scott Foley): Takes the fall for B613 and spends the rest of his life in jail. Olivia apologizes to him for making him step out of the sun. Jake admits that he got something out of the whole thing \u2014 he loved Olivia. Jake becomes the only person who pays for everyone's sins, letting all the Gladiators off the hook for everything that they've done.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Rowan (Joe Morton): His testimony helps set all the Gladiators free \u2014 and bring down Jake and all of B613.\n\n\u2022 David (Josh Malina): Pays the price for Cyrus' lust for power and is killed by the vice president.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Charlie (George Newbern): Is released from jail and works for his wife at Quinn Perkins and Associates.\n\n\n\n\u2022 Marcus (Cornelius Smith Jr.): The latest Gladiator likely winds up in the White House \u2014 as the first husband to president Mellie Grant. What's more, he's going to explore his own political future, with Fitz backing him.\n\nScandal, which helped cement Rhimes as a mega-producer and brand of her own, marked the close of prolific showrunner's chapter on broadcast as every series she creates going forward will be for Netflix, where she signed a nine-figure overall deal.\n\nIn terms of Scandal's future, Rhimes \u2014 who once seriously considered doing a B613 spinoff \u2014 confirmed that the end of the series is indeed the end of the franchise and there are no offshoots planned: \"Scandal is done.\" While it would be easy to revisit the world of corruption and Gladiators on ABC's Rhimes-produced drama How to Get Away With Murder after both series crossed over earlier this season, there are no current plans for that, either, though she stressed that the decision ultimately lies with showrunner Pete Nowalk.\n\nWhat did you think of the Scandal series finale?

{"label": true, "txt": "Pitch Perfect 2. Photo: Universal Pictures\n\nThe trailer for the third and final (I\u2019ll believe when I see it) installment in the Pitch Perfect franchise has finally arrived \u2014 and with it, immense waves of Pitch Perfect nostalgia. (Isn\u2019t it wonderful to be alive at a time when a \u201cPitch Perfect franchise\u201d is a real thing?) According to that new trailer, Pitch Perfect 3 promises more of what we\u2019ve all come to expect from the Pitch Perfect movies: organized nerd singing, mash-ups of songs we didn\u2019t know we needed but now can\u2019t live without (hello \u201cWake Me Up\u201d and \u201cZombie\u201d), and, of course, the inexplicable but always adorable use of \u201caca\u201d as a prefix. In honor of this beloved aca-tradition, Vulture has gone ahead and made a list of all the plays on \u201caca\u201d and \u201cpitch\u201d in the franchise thus far. No, this is not a joke. We\u2019re Dixie Chick serious.\n\nPitch Perfect\n\nThe seminal movie about college students making sweet, sweet music with their mouths, and the bonds of sisterhood overcoming any obstacle \u2014 even when that obstacle is a gorgeous solo from Ben Platt. The original Pitch Perfect introduces us to the world of competitive collegiate a cappella singing through Anna Kendrick\u2019s Beca, a freshman who pretty much hates everything and is honestly, a real bitch, until she meets the Barden Bellas and learns that singing covers and having a solid group of lady friends is good for the soul. She also learns \u2014 thanks to Anna Camp\u2019s Aubrey \u2014 that a cappella is very serious, and to show that seriousness, a person should use \u201caca\u201d as a prefix or \u201cpitch\u201d in a punny way whenever possible.\n\n\u201cAca-scuse me?\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s nothing like the first time, is there? This is aca-enthusiast Aubrey to Beca after Beca makes fun of a cappella during the Activities Fair. It is laced with as much attitude as you imagine.\n\n\u201cMy fellow aca-people, we will not let egotistical, big-headed garbage dirtballs \u2014 whoever you may be \u2014 get in our way. I promise you we will return to the ICCAs and finish what we started last year.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s time to be honest, pitches: Aubrey is the best character in the Pitch Perfect franchise and she never gets the recognition she deserves. Don\u2019t aca-at me.\n\n\u201cWell, well, well, look who\u2019s in treble!\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t \u201caca\u201d or \u201cpitch\u201d related, but of all the puns the Treblemakers get out of their group name, this one, used on initiation night, is the best. It\u2019s worth it for Adam Devine\u2019s line reading alone. Bumper is the worst, but also kind of the best, right?\n\n\u201cLadies, welcome to aca-initiation night.\u201d\n\nAubrey has things to do and covers of songs to arrange, she cannot waste the syllables on \u201ca cappella initiation night.\u201d This usage is simply about brevity.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re one of those a cappella girls. I\u2019m one of those a cappella boys. And we\u2019re gonna have aca-children. It\u2019s inevitable.\u201d\n\nSlow your roll, Jesse! The way to any college girl\u2019s heart is not to immediately talk about having children, aca or not.\n\n\u201cHands in aca-bitches!\u201d\n\nAubrey to the Bellas for their first group huddle. \u201cAca\u201d is a very versatile prefix, used here as a term of endearment.\n\n\u201cI know you have a toner for Jesse.\u201d\n\nAh, yes, the moment in which we all learned that \u201ctoner\u201d is the term for a \u201cmusical boner,\u201d and also learned that \u201cmusical boner\u201d is a thing, I guess. Never tell me Pitch Perfect isn\u2019t educational.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re gonna be aca-awesome.\u201d\n\nChloe is the yin to Aubrey\u2019s yang, and when Aubrey is freaking out about how unprepared the Bellas are for their gig at the Sigma Beta Theta Fall Mixer, Chloe knows to talk her friend off the ledge via use of her favorite prefix. Of course, they go on to bomb the Sigma Beta Theta Fall Mixer, but that is neither here nor there. Also, them being so bad gives us one of the greatest lines in the movie: \u201cThis makes my beer taste bad.\u201d\n\n\u201cAca-scuse me?\u201d\n\nYup, it\u2019s your girl Aubrey, back with her standard reply to anyone who threatens her a cappella way of life. This time, it\u2019s after Chloe suggests that Beca may be onto something when she complains about the Bellas never trying anything new. Beca is right, but there are more tactful ways to go about it. So yes, Chloe and Beca, ACA-SCUSE YOU.\n\n\u201cThe Sockapellas\u201d\n\n\u201cProving that it doesn\u2019t get better for everyone after high school.\u201d\n\n\u201cAca-scuse me?\u201d\n\n\u201cAca-believe it.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the sitch: The Bellas are on their way to the ICCA Semi-Finals, but run out of gas \u2026because Fat Amy forgot to fill the tank after being attacked by a burrito at the hands of her true love, Bumper. Aubrey has every right to \u201caca-scuse\u201d her teammate, and honestly, I don\u2019t appreciate Fat Amy\u2019s tone here. Is she making light of the \u201caca\u201d prefix?\n\n\u201cYou guys are gonna get pitch-slapped so hard, your man boobs are gonna concave.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s Fat Amy with a great burn for Bumper, after he teases the team over their dated semi-finals set list. For a movie called Pitch Perfect, they do not use \u201cpitch\u201d wordplay nearly enough. It fits into so many phrases! #PitchPlease\n\n\u201cAca-huddle, now!\u201d\n\nThis is, of course, Aubrey, signaling to us that aca-huddles are way more serious than normal huddles.\n\n\u201cThe aca-gods have looked down on us and they have given us a second chance.\u201d\n\nI wish Aubrey would go more into detail as to who these \u201caca-gods\u201d are once she receives news that the Bellas have won a spot at Nationals, thanks to a technicality. Are the \u201caca-gods\u201d Pentatonix?\n\n\u201cAca-awkward.\u201d\n\nYes, Fat Amy, it is \u201caca-awkward\u201d when Aubrey tells her BFF Chloe to get her head out of her ass because \u201cit\u2019s not a hat,\u201d in front of the whole group. Excellent word choice.\n\n\u201cShut your eyes and get rid of all the aca-politics.\u201d\n\nJohn and Gail are back at Nationals, and they really know how to set the scene. Am I the only one who cries throughout the entire Bella finale performance?\n\n\u201cListen up, aca-ballers!\u201d\n\nYour final \u201caca\u201d fix of the film comes courtesy of Christopher Mintz-Plasse, the saddest audition coordinator there ever was. Let this dude sing! LET HIM LIVE.\n\nPitch Perfect 2\n\nPitch Perfect 2 doubles down on the Fat Amy jokes, but, surprisingly, not so much on the \u201caca\u201d wordplay. The sequel sees our girls prepare for and then (of course) win the A Cappella World Championships. The Bellas main competition this go-around comes from Das Sound Machine, a German a cappella group full of superhumans who are no doubt better than all of us at everything. Pitch Perfect 2 also features a very cute subplot about Benji falling for the newest Bella, Emily (Hailee Steinfeld), and reminds us that no one would hate it if the Pitch Perfect franchise was about the power of lady friendship first, then Benji\u2019s revenge second.\n\nThe \u201caca\u201d prefix is used sparingly, but for the most part, in much more creative ways than in the first film; they don\u2019t blow their aca-wad all at once.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s Talk-apella\u201d\n\nEveryone\u2019s favorite a cappella commentators, Gail and John, are back \u2014 and this time with a podcast called Let\u2019s Talk-apella. Honestly, that\u2019s a great name. How has it not been taken before? Surely, there must be people clamoring for an a cappella\u2013based podcast, right?\n\n\u201cThose deutsch-bags!\u201d\n\nFat Amy uses this clever wordplay to cut to the core of the Bellas German nemeses. Moments before, she praises the musical legacy of David Hasselhoff, so don\u2019t go thinking Fat Amy has a vendetta against all Germans. It\u2019s just this one, very specific, very good-looking group of Germans who want to crush her friends\u2019 dreams of making music with their mouths.\n\n\u201cO-M-aca-G!\u201d\n\nBaby Bella Emily fits right in with her new a cappella sisters: She is also a complete weirdo.\n\n\u201cAca-wiedersehen, bitches!\u201d\n\nOne of the best running gags of Pitch Perfect 2 is that Anna Kendrick\u2019s Beca is completely smitten with the leaders of Das Sound Machine, even when she wants to be angry. She attempts to \u201caca\u201d her way out of a confrontation with her enemies/crushes, and although she gets props for aca-ing in a second language, this does nothing to help the Bella\u2019s cause.\n\n\u201cYou are such a disa-aca-pointment.\u201d\n\nGreen Bay Packers offensive tackle David Bakhtiari says this to teammate Clay Matthews after Matthews blanks during the country song round in an underground a cappella league riff-off. Is that the greatest sentence ever written?\n\n\u201cI almost burnt to death because of you aca-bitches.\u201d\n\nAfter another disastrous performance, Cynthia Rose knows there\u2019s nothing like a classic to really insult your friends. Classics are classics for a reason.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not Copen-hating this place.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not an aca-word, but as the Bellas arrive in Denmark for the A Cappella World Championships, one has to wonder: Shouldn\u2019t this be Copenhagen\u2019s tourism slogan?\n\n\u201cTonight, groups from around the globe duke it out for the title of Aca-World Champions.\u201d\n\nI mean, this one seems pretty valid."}
{"label": true, "txt": "The cereal's logo and leprechaun mascot, Lucky. Product type Cereal with marshmallows Owner General Mills Country United States Introduced March 20, 1964 ; 54 years ago ( ) Markets United States, United Kingdom, Canada Tagline \"They're magically delicious.\" Website luckycharms .com\n\nLucky Charms is a brand of cereal produced by the General Mills food company since 1964.[1] The cereal consists of toasted oat pieces and multi-colored marshmallow shapes (\"marbits\" or marshmallow bits). The label features a leprechaun mascot, Lucky, animated in commercials.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nLucky Charms was created in 1964 by product developer John Holahan. General Mills management challenged a team of product developers to use the available manufacturing capacity from either of General Mills' two principal cereal products\u2014Wheaties or Cheerios\u2014and do something unique. Holahan came up with the idea after a visit to the grocery store in which he decided to mix Cheerios with bits of Brach's Circus Peanuts.[2]\n\nAn advertising company employed by General Mills and Company suggested marketing the new cereal around the idea of charm bracelets.[3] Thus, the charms of Lucky Charms were born. Lucky Charms is the first cereal to include marshmallows in the recipe. The mascot of Lucky Charms, created in 1963, is Lucky the Leprechaun, also known as Sir Charms, and originally called L.C. Leprechaun.[4] The cartoon character's voice was supplied by the late voice actor Arthur Anderson until 1992. Lucky has also been voiced by Eric Bauza, Tex Brashear, Jason Graae, Doug Preis, and Daniel Ross.[5] In 1975, Lucky the Leprechaun was briefly replaced by Waldo the Wizard in New England, while Lucky remained the mascot in the rest of the United States.[6] The oat cereal was not originally sugar coated. After initial sales failed to meet expectations, the oats were sugar coated, and the cereal's success grew. Piggy banks and plastic watches were introduced as cereal box send-away prizes as a marketing tactic to increase sales. The recipe for the cereal remained unchanged until the introduction of a new flavor: Chocolate Lucky Charms, in 2005. Later in 2012, General Mills introduced \"Lucky Charms Marshmallow Treats.\"\n\nFollowing the product launch, the General Mills marketing department found that sales performed dramatically better if the composition of the marbits changed periodically.[3] Various features of the marbits were modified to maximize their appeal to young consumers. Over the years, over 40 limited edition features such as Winter Lucky Charms, Olympic-themed Lucky Charms, and Lucky Charms featuring marshmallow landmarks from around the world, were created to drive consumer demands. In focus groups and market research, more brightly colored charms resulted in better sales than did dull or pastel colors.[3] Currently, General Mills conducts \"concept-ideation\" studies on Lucky Charms.[3]\n\nMarshmallows [ edit ]\n\nLucky Charms\n\nThe first boxes of Lucky Charms cereal contained marshmallows in the shapes of pink hearts, yellow moons, orange stars, and green clovers. The lineup has changed occasionally, beginning with the introduction of blue diamonds in 1975, followed by purple horseshoes in 1983,[7] red balloons in 1989, green trees 1991, rainbows in 1992, blue moons 1995, leprechaun hats in 1997 (temporarily replaced the green clovers), orange shooting stars and around the world charms in 1998 (added blue, green, yellow, purple, and red in 2011), a crystal ball in 2001, and an hourglass in 2008.[3] In 2013, 6 new rainbow swirl moons and 2 new rainbow charms were introduced. From the original four marshmallows, the permanent roster as of 2013 includes eight marshmallows.\n\nOlder marshmallows were phased out periodically. The first shapes to disappear were the yellow moons and blue diamonds, replaced by yellow/orange pots of gold and blue moons respectively in 1994. In 2006, the assortment included purple horseshoes; red balloons; blue crescent-moons; orange and white shooting stars; yellow and orange pots of gold; pink, yellow, and blue rainbows; two-tone green leprechaun hats; pink hearts (the one shape to survive since the beginning); with the most recent addition being the return of the clovers in 2004. The hourglass shape was retired in spring 2018 and was replaced by a unicorn, which was chosen on social media by way of emojis[8][9]. The size and brightness of the marshmallows changed in 2004.[10]\n\nRecent changes to the marshmallows include the star shape taking on a \"star\" design, the orange five-pointed star being complemented by a white \"trail.\" In late 2005, another marshmallow shape was added, the \"Hidden Key\". It is a solid yellow marshmallow that resembles an arched door (similar to the shape of a tombstone; flat at the bottom, flat sides with a round top). When liquid is added to the cereal, the sugar in the marshmallow dissolves and the shape of a skeleton key appears \"as if by magic.\" The tagline was, \"Unlock the door with milk!\" This \"new\" marshmallow type has been used in other hot and cold cereals, but with mixed success (from characters \"hidden\" inside a bigger marshmallow to letters appearing). In early June 2006, General Mills introduced Magic Mirror marshmallows. In 2008, yellow and orange hourglass marshmallows were introduced with the marketing tagline of, \"The Hourglass Charm has the power to Stop Time * Speed Up Time * Reverse Time\". As of 2011, swirled marshmallows and rainbow-colored stars have been introduced.[citation needed] In 2018, for the first time in ten years Lucky Charms retired a marshmallow, which was the hourglass, and added a new permanent marshmallow, the Magical Unicorn. Its powers are unknown.\n\nThe marshmallows are meant to represent Lucky's magical charms, each with their own special meaning or \"power.\" The following are explanations of the permanent marshmallows:[11]\n\nHearts - power to bring things to life Shooting Stars - power to fly Horseshoes - power to speed things up Green Clovers - luck, but you will never know what kind of luck you will get Blue Moons - power of invisibility Rainbows - instantaneous travel from place to place Red Balloons - power to make things float Unicorn - according to the inaugural cereal box, unicorns can \"cleanse water with a touch of their horn,\" \"heal whatever troubles you,\" and \"always know when you are telling the truth\"\n\nLimited Edition Marshmallows [ edit ]\n\nThere have been more than 30 featured limited edition marshmallow shapes over the years, with the introduction of themed Lucky Charms, such as Winter Lucky Charms. Some of these include:\n\nIn 1986, a whale-shaped marshmallow was temporarily added to the lineup. [12]\n\nIn 1990, a green pine tree-shaped marshmallow was temporarily added to the lineup. [12] During that time, the cereal promoted Earth Day with a free Colorado Blue Spruce seedling with proofs-of-purchase. [13]\n\nDuring that time, the cereal promoted Earth Day with a free Colorado Blue Spruce seedling with proofs-of-purchase. In 1991, the star and balloon shape marshmallows were combined for a short time. The red balloon featured a gold six-pointed star. The star was removed at a later date to make the Red Balloon and Star marshmallows separate. [12]\n\nIn 1994, sprinkles were temporarily added to the marshmallows.\n\nIn 1999, the moon shape marshmallows were modified with the addition of the yellow curve line for a limited time.\n\nIn 2000, a \"New Sparkling Rainbow\" was added to the mix for a limited time. It was described by General Mills as \"a sprinkling of multicolored sugar on a white rainbow marbit.\" This marshmallow replaced the original rainbow at this time. [14]\n\nIn 2010, the swirled marshmallows were in Lucky Charms for a limited time.\n\nIn June 2013, two new rainbow marshmallows were added for LGBT Pride Month. [15]\n\nIn 2015, new diamond shaped marshmallows were added in. [ citation needed ]\n\nIntroduced in 2017, limited edition cinnamon vanilla Lucky Charms include only snowman, snowball, and snowflake shaped marshmallows.\n\nIn 2018 a unicorn shaped marshmallow was added and is here to stay unofficially.\n\nIn 2018 winter-themed marshmallows, including snowmen and snowflakes, were added as part of a limited addition chocolatey winter mix[16].\n\nMarshmallow-only promotion [ edit ]\n\nIn May 2017, General Mills announced they would be promoting 10,000 boxes of cereal that contain only marshmallow pieces.[17] In order to win one of the coveted boxes, consumers would need to purchase a specially marked box of regular Lucky Charms with a code on the inside panel. The code would be entered into an official website to see if the consumer is the winner of one of the 10,000 novelty boxes produced. The sweepstakes ran through December 2017.[18][19]\n\nTheme song [ edit ]\n\nIn the earliest commercials, Lucky Charms cereal had no theme jingle; action was accompanied by a light instrumental \"Irish\" tune. Soon, however, a simple two-line tag was added:\n\nFrosted Lucky Charms, They're magically delicious!\n\nThis simple closer, with the kids usually singing the first line and Lucky singing the second, survived into the 1980s.\n\nThen, with the addition of the purple horseshoe marbit, it was extended into a jingle describing the contents of the box.[20] This was later revised with the addition of red balloons to the now-familiar \"Hearts, stars, horseshoes, clovers, and blue moons, pots of gold, and rainbows, and big red balloons!\u201d In 2008, the pot of gold was replaced with the hourglass in the theme song. In 2018 hourglass was replaced by unicorn. The jingle is usually accompanied by mentioning that Lucky Charms contains whole grain ingredients, and is part of a balanced meal. General Mills' market position is centered on cereals that contain \"more whole grain than any other single ingredient, which is significant, because 95 percent of Americans aren't eating minimally 48 grams of whole grain per day as recommended by the U.S. Dietary Guidelines.\"[21]\n\nTaglines [ edit ]\n\nThey're Magically Delicious!

Also, Chelsea Houska faced Adam Lind in court and can finally sleep soundly again. Find out what you might have missed during this week\u2019s episode of Teen Mom 2.\n\nChelsea Finally Feels Her Daughter is Safe\n\nIt was finally time for Chelsea to face her ex in court to try to hyphenate her daughter\u2019s last name to match her and her husband Cole Deboer\u2019s name. She also wanted to get her visitation agreement changed so that Adam could only see Aubree in a visitation center. She couldn\u2019t be more nervous to faceher ex, who she hadn\u2019t seen in about a year.\n\n\u201cI hate that I doubt myself,\u201d Chelsea said and continued to worry about her intentions. \u201cAm I being ridiculous? Can you be too ridiculous when it comes to your child?\u201d\n\nIn the end, everything went Chelsea\u2019s way, and she cried on the car ride home because she finally felt like Aubree was in a safe situation.\n\n\u201cI just feel like a weight is lifted off my shoulders,\u201d Chelsea said. They celebrated by telling Aubree about the name change by writing it on a cake, and Aubree was over-the-moon.\n\nBriana and Javi are Official\n\nAfter weeks of beating around the bush, Briana finally admitted that she and Javi were \u201cboyfriend and girlfriend.\u201d She went to Delaware to celebrate Lincoln\u2019s birthday with the kids. She even made Javi and their children matching shirts for the party.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to today,\u201d Javi said, and the two were acting like they were married already even though they just made it official. Javi was stressed about the Kailyn situation, but was mushy about having Briana to help him through it. \u201cIt\u2019s nice having you by my side,\u201d he told her.\n\nEven though last week\u2019s episode made it seem like Kailyn was in a relationship with her friend Dom, she shut rumors down this week by declaring she was too busy dealing with other people to be in a relationship. Although she was mostly referring to her children, the Briana/Javi drama might also have had something to do with it.\n\nWhen Javi decided Briana was going to go to Lincoln\u2019s party that he was supposed to cohost with Kailyn, Kailyn dropped out and had her own party. Briana exchanged some vicious texts with Javi\u2019s ex, and it caught Kailyn off guard.\n\n\u201cShut the f\u2014k up cause now I\u2019m mad. S\u2014k my d\u2014k, you dumb bitch,\u201d Briana texted Kailyn when Kailyn said she didn\u2019t want to meet up with her to talk thing about.\n\nAfter that explosion, Kailyn prohibited the crew from filming any part of the party because Briana was there. \u201cI don\u2019t think that she\u2019s a good person,\u201d Kailyn said. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything to do with him.\u201d\n\nNathan Might Still Be In Love With Jenelle\n\nJenelle Evans embarked on a new business venture and transformed her personal Facebook into a more professional page.

Her ex Nathan Griffith didn\u2019t waste any time to text Jenelle to find out what was going on and tell her he wants the best for her.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know s\u2014t about Kaiser. You don\u2019t ask about Kaiser. But you ask if I\u2019m broken up with David,\u201d Jenelle told her friend about the text, who proclaimed that Nathan was just trying to weasel his way back into her life. To no one\u2019s surprise, David lost it when he found out about the text. He got into a fight with Nathan over it and called him some extremely derogatory words. When Jenelle was suppose to drop off Kaiser to Nathan after, she sent David\u2019s mother to avoid drama.\n\nHowever, Nathan was so made about the texts, he went after David\u2019s mom. He also seemed a little upset that the two were still together. \u201cThey need to get off the drugs,\u201d Nathan said. \u201cI won\u2019t do this no more.\u201d\n\nLeah Opens Up To Her Daughter\n\nLeah Messer took her daughter Aleeah Grace to a therapist this episode to work out some behavioral issues she was dealing with. Aleeah was acting out, and Leah and her ex Corey Simms thought it had something to do with her twin getting more attention than her. The appointment went well, but Leah had to talk about her daughter\u2019s problems in front of her, which made it awkward.\n\n\u201cIt was hard to talk about why you\u2019re not always the nicest to Ali,\u201d Leah told Aleeah afterward. \u201cEven when you have a bad day, I still love you.\u201d\n\nTeen Mom 2 airs on MTV Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!"}

The site's critical consensus reads, \"The Assassination of Versace starts with a bang and unfurls slowly, moving backward through an intricate (and occasionally convoluted) murder mystery anchored by a career-defining performance from Darren Criss.\"[56] On Metacritic, the season has a score of 74 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"[57]\n\nReaction from individuals involved [ edit ]\n\nIn January 2018, the Versace family released a statement criticizing the series. They explained they have \"neither authorized nor had any involvement whatsoever\" in the production of the season, before adding that it \"should only be considered as a work of fiction.\"[58] Executive producer Ryan Murphy answered that the series was \"not a work of fiction\" as it is based on a non-fiction book, Maureen Orth's Vulgar Favors, and that the production team and FX stand by the author and her work. Comparing it to The People v. O. J. Simpson, Murphy added that the season is \"a work of non-fiction obviously with docudrama elements,\" and not a documentary.[58] Following this answer, the Versace family released a second statement, still slamming the series as \"a work of fiction\" because \"the Orth book itself is full of gossip and speculation.\" They also heavily criticized Orth's work, calling it an \"effort to create a sensational story\" with \"second-hand hearsay that is full of contradictions.\" They gave the example of Gianni Versace's medical condition, as Orth claims that Versace was HIV positive at the time of his death.[59]\n\nAntonio D'Amico also criticized the series, deeming some scenes as \"ridiculous\" and insisting that \"so much has been fictionalised\". He also revealed that he does not plan to watch it, but that he would have been happy if Ricky Martin, who plays his role, got in contact to get some insight into his relationship with Versace.[60]\n\nAccording to Ryan Murphy, Donatella Versace was very supportive that Pen\u00e9lope Cruz played her role. As Cruz and Versace are friends, Murphy explained that, when he offered her the role, Cruz asked the permission of Versace before agreeing to do it. He also revealed that, while Cruz was representing the series at the 75th Golden Globe Awards, Versace \"very graciously sent [her] a lovely and huge flower arrangement saying 'good luck.'\"[58]\n\nRatings [ edit ]\n\nAccolades [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\n^ [6] This episode was available five days before the official premiere for FX+ subscribers."}

Simpson was sentenced to 33 years in prison with eligibility for parole in 9 years, and would be released from prison on October 1, 2017. Court membership Judge(s) sitting Jackie Glass\n\nThe O. J. Simpson robbery case (officially State of Nevada v. Orenthal James Simpson, et al.) was a criminal case prosecuted in 2007\u20132008 in the U.S. state of Nevada, primarily involving the retired American football player O. J. Simpson. On the night of September 13, 2007, a group of men led by Simpson entered a room in the Palace Station hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. Bruce Fromong, a sports memorabilia dealer, testified that the group of men broke into his hotel room and stole various sports memorabilia at gunpoint.[1] Three days later, on September 16, 2007, Simpson was arrested for his involvement in the robbery and held without bail.[2] He admitted taking the items, which he said had been stolen from him, but denied breaking into the room. Simpson also denied the allegation that he or the people with him carried weapons.[3][4]\n\nOn October 3, 2008\u2014exactly 13 years to the day after he was acquitted of the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown, and Ronald Goldman\u2014Simpson was found guilty of all 10 charges. On December 5, 2008, Simpson was sentenced to 33 years in prison with eligibility for parole in nine years (in October 2017). On July 20, 2017, Simpson was granted parole,[5] and was freed on October 1, 2017.[6]\n\nRobbery [ edit ]\n\nAlfred Beardsley, a memorabilia dealer, contacted Tom Riccio, another memorabilia dealer, regarding a trove of O. J. Simpson items Beardsley had in Las Vegas. Riccio then informed Simpson of the items. Claiming that the memorabilia were stolen from him, Simpson, along with Riccio, devised a plan to confront the dealers and get them back. Simpson, who was already planning on going to Las Vegas for a wedding, recruited some wedding guests for the operation.[7] The robbery was planned at Palms Casino Resort.[8] Bruce Fromong, another memorabilia dealer and a friend of Simpson's, met with Beardsley and Riccio in room 1203 at the Palace Station, a room Riccio had rented. Beardsley had contacted Fromong about a client hoping to buy a large amount of O. J. Simpson memorabilia; Fromong was unaware the client was Simpson.[7][9] Riccio had Beardsley and Fromong move the items into the room and spread the memorabilia on the bed to create a display.[10] After a pre-wedding dinner, Simpson and five accomplices drove to the Palace Station, where they met Riccio in the lobby.[7][10] After some confusion over the room's location, Simpson's party entered the room at 7:38 PM.[7][8]\n\nWhen the group entered the room, Simpson ordered his group to not allow anybody to leave.[10] Simpson and Beardsley proceeded to argue over where the memorabilia came from.[7] During the confrontation, accomplice Michael McClinton threatened Fromong with a gun.[8] Simpson's group then stuffed O. J. Simpson memorabilia, along with autographed Pete Rose baseballs and Joe Montana lithographs, into pillowcases.[11][8] The party then returned to the Palms Casino Resort.[8] The confrontation lasted about six minutes.[12]\n\nInvolved parties [ edit ]\n\nO.

[18] [19]\n\nAlfred Beardsley: Memorabilia dealer, and convicted felon.[20]\n\nSimpson's attorneys [ edit ]\n\nYale Galanter was an attorney who had represented Simpson in Florida prior to this incident. According to Simpson, Galanter encouraged Simpson to retrieve his personal items. Galanter was with Simpson in Las Vegas prior to the robbery. The former star athlete said Galanter told him during a dinner discussion in Las Vegas, \"you have the right to get your stuff\", but cautioned he could not trespass on private property. Simpson said he told Galanter that if the suit he wore during his sensational 1990s murder trial was included among the memorabilia, he planned to burn it, and Galanter responded: \"You're not going to burn it, you're going to bring it to me.\"[21] In his testimony, Simpson stated that he gave the property stolen in Las Vegas to Galanter.[22] Simpson testified that he paid Galanter $125,000 to make a video montage for the appeal, but no video montage was ever made.[23] Simpson's attempt to secure a new trial centered around his claim that Galanter was incompetent and had a conflict of interest [24] but this argument was rejected by the trial court and the state Supreme Court.[25]\n\nGabriel L. Grasso, Galanter's former friend and co-counsel, said the lawyer complained during the case that he did not have money to hire investigators or an expert to analyze a critical audio recording from the night of the heist.[24]\n\nInvestigation and trial [ edit ]\n\nInvestigators initially named Simpson a suspect, but questioned him the next day and released him soon after. On September 15, one of the accomplices, Walter Alexander, was arrested and charged with two counts of robbery with a deadly weapon, one count of conspiracy to commit robbery with a deadly weapon, two counts of assault with a deadly weapon, and one count of burglary with a deadly weapon. Alexander was on his way to McCarran International Airport when he was approached by the police. Earlier in the day, two guns were recovered when the police executed a warrant at one of the men's homes.\n\nOn September 16, Simpson was arrested by Clark County, Nevada, authorities.[26] The celebrity gossip website TMZ.com published an audio recording of the incident which indicated Simpson and others shouted at the occupants of the room and demanded the return of various items.[27] On the audiotape, recorded by Thomas Riccio, Simpson is heard saying: \"Don't let nobody out of this room. ... Motherfucker, you think you can steal my shit and sell it?\"[28] An FBI expert witness claimed that the tapes had \"over-recordings\" and \"might\" have been altered.[15] Riccio reportedly said he tipped off Simpson to go to the hotel to look for his goods, and he reportedly said he deliberately planted the recording device to prove to Simpson that Beardsley and Fromong were fencing his stuff. Riccio considers Simpson a friend, and brought Simpson to the room and escorted him and the memorabilia out.[29]\n\nOn the day after the incident, in a 20-minute interview with the L.A. Times, Simpson brushed off the allegations saying, \"I'm O. J. Simpson. How am I going to think that I'm going to rob somebody and get away with it? Besides, I thought what happens in Las Vegas stays in Las Vegas... You've got to understand, this ain't somebody going to steal somebody's drugs or something like that. This is somebody going to get his private [belongings] back. That's it. That's not robbery.\" [30]\n\nIn an interview, Walter Alexander said he thought the whole incident was a setup to get Simpson. He does not \"understand what the big deal is\", or why Riccio would set this whole operation up, tape it and then sell the tape to the media.[31] Alexander's ex-wife gave an interview to the New York Times in which she said many people carry tape recorders with them around Simpson to try and catch him slipping so they can profit from it. During police questioning, Alexander said Simpson asked for guns to be carried to look tough but that the guns would not be used. He also added that McClinton impersonated a police officer and acted too rough to the surprise of the others, including Simpson. He claims Simpson repeatedly told McClinton to \"calm down, calm down.\"[32]\n\nSimpson appeared in court on September 19, 2007. Represented by attorneys from Florida and Nevada, Simpson was granted a bail of $125,000. Presiding Justice of the Peace Joe M. Bonaventure, Jr., stated that Simpson was not allowed to have any contact with any of the co-defendants, and must surrender his passport. Simpson did not enter a plea.[33][34] Both Clarence Stewart and O. J. Simpson were charged with:\n\nCount 1: Conspiracy to commit a crime\n\nCount 2: Conspiracy to commit kidnapping\n\nCount 3: Conspiracy to commit robbery\n\nCount 4: Burglary while in possession of a deadly weapon\n\nCount 5: 1st degree kidnapping with use of a deadly weapon (for Bruce Fromong)\n\nCount 6: 1st degree kidnapping with use of a deadly weapon (for Alfred Beardsley)\n\nCount 7: Robbery with use of a deadly weapon (for Bruce Fromong)\n\nCount 8: Robbery with use of a deadly weapon (for Alfred Beardsley)\n\nCount 9: Assault with a deadly weapon (for Bruce Fromong)\n\nCount 10: Assault with a deadly weapon (for Alfred Beardsley)\n\nCount 11: Coercion with a deadly weapon (for Bruce Fromong as an alternative to count 5)\n\nCount 12: Coercion with a deadly weapon (for Alfred Beardsley as an alternative to count 6)\n\nSimpson's order to not allow anybody to leave the room was the reason for the kidnapping charges.[35]\n\nThe trial began on September 8, 2008, in the court of Nevada District Court Judge Jackie Glass, before an all-white jury,[36] in stark contrast to Simpson's earlier murder trial.[37] On October 3, 2008, Simpson was found guilty of all charges. On October 10, 2008, Simpson's attorneys, Yale Galanter and Gabriel Grasso, PC, moved for new trial (trial de novo) on grounds of judicial errors (two jurors of the same race as Simpson were dismissed) and insufficient evidence. Clarence \"C. J.\" Stewart's attorney, E. Brent Bryson, also petitioned for new trial, alleging Stewart should have been tried separately, and cited perceived misconduct by the jury foreman. Galanter and Stewart later appealed to the Nevada Supreme Court after Judge Glass denied their motions, and the defendants were found guilty. In October 2010, the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed Simpson's convictions, while Stewart's appeal was accepted.[38] Stewart was released in January 2011 after entering an Alford plea and being sentenced to 9 months house arrest and 3 years probation.[citation needed] Galanter motioned for a rehearing of the Simpson appeal in November 2010, which was denied by the Nevada Supreme Court in February 2011.[citation needed]\n\nSimpson was sentenced on 5 December 2008. The judge ordered eight of the ten counts to run concurrently, with a maximum sentence of 33 years (until 2041) with parole possible after nine years in 2017 when Simpson became eligible at age 70. Simpson was incarcerated in the Lovelock Correctional Center until 1 October 2017, when he was released.[39][40]\n\nAudio tape [ edit ]\n\nAn audio tape recorded by Riccio, which was later sold to TMZ.com, was central to the trial and conviction. FBI audio examiner Kenneth Marr testified that he was not able to determine whether or not the files were altered. He said he found areas of over-recording on the device that he said \"might\" mean the audio files had been manipulated. Alfred Beardsley stated that he told District Attorney David Roger and another official that the audio had been doctored. \"There's a whole section (missing) \u2026 and I talked to you directly about that\".[15]\n\nMotion for retrial [ edit ]\n\nSimpson, represented by attorney Patricia Palm, filed a motion for retrial.[41] In May 2013, the motion was heard; the week-long hearing included testimony from witnesses and Simpson. Simpson was represented at the hearing by Palm, who was joined by attorneys Ozzie Fumo and Thomas Pitaro.[42] Simpson's main argument was ineffective assistance of counsel. Simpson alleged his counsel Yale Galanter did not tell him about alleged plea-bargain offers that would have resulted in substantially shorter sentences. Grasso testified that it was Galanter's decision not to have Simpson testify.[43]\n\nOn May 17, 2013, Yale Galanter testified. He stated that Simpson had confided to him that guns were brought to the hotel room, and admitted to Galanter that he messed up in doing that.[44] Galanter made this statement after he was reminded that Simpson had waived attorney-client privilege, enabling his former attorney to testify.[44] Galanter was photographed by the Associated Press laughing about Simpson's arguments on the witness stand.[44]\n\nGalanter confirmed that the night before the robbery he was dining at a restaurant with Simpson and a group of people. Galanter testified that Simpson casually mentioned his intent to retrieve \"his stuff,\" in what Simpson called a \"sting.\" Galanter testified that he asked Simpson, \"What are you doing?\" and advised against it, telling Simpson \"to call the police.\" Galanter testified: \"Mr. Simpson never told me he was going to go to the Palace (Station) hotel with a bunch of thugs, kidnap people and take property by force. To insinuate I, as a lawyer and officer of the court, would have blessed it is insane.\"[45] Galanter did accept that Simpson's conviction was Galanter's responsibility.\n\nIn regard to plea offers, Galanter testified his practice is to always communicate plea offers to the client. He denied that Simpson did not know about plea offers. Galanter testified that during the trial he informed Simpson that prosecutors were offering a plea with 2\u20135 years of prison time. Simpson instructed Galanter to go back to the DA with a counter-offer of one year, which the DA immediately refused; the trial proceeded with no further offers or counters.[45]\n\nTimeline [ edit ]\n\nSeptember 13, 2007 \u2013 Simpson and a group of men at a wedding party enter room number 1203 at the Palace Station hotel to retrieve sports memorabilia they claim were stolen.

The video opens with a first-person account of a suicide attempt from Kevin Hines, a man who jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge, and it features a conversation between Paul and Dr. John Draper, the director of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Paul also plans to donate $1 million to suicide prevention organizations.\n\nAlthough Logan has been silent on the subject until today, Jake Paul \u2014 Logan\u2019s brother and another popular influencer \u2014 addressed the controversy briefly in a video posted January 22nd. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel right to comment on it right away,\u201d Jake says. \u201cI think what Logan did was very, very, very wrong, and he made a huge mistake,\u201d Jake says. \u201cNot only is he paying for it, but he is learning from it. I think in no way shape or form is suicide a joke or should be made fun of ... He did not mean to offend anyone.\u201d Regardless of intent, Logan\u2019s actions still had consequences. In response to negative feedback from the community, YouTube condemned Paul\u2019s video and removed the vlogger as a preferred ad partner. Paul\u2019s YouTube Red projects were also shelved.\n\nFor better or worse, Paul now has more of the spotlight than ever before. \u201cIt\u2019s time to start a new chapter in my life as I continue to educate both myself and others on suicide,\u201d says Paul in his video. \u201cI\u2019m humbled and thankful to say this is just the beginning.\u201d It\u2019s possible that this controversy was indeed a wake-up for Paul, and a chance for him to change an excruciatingly public mistake into a lesson for the greater good.

{"label": true, "txt": "In pumped-up espionage potboilers like \u201cAtomic Blonde\u201d or \u201cSalt,\u201d Charlize Theron and Angelina Jolie have gone through the motions of imitating male action stars at their most kick-ass grandiose. They\u2019re slickly \u201cempowered\u201d women, yet it\u2019s hard to distinguish that power from the thriller-video decadence of 21st-century action filmmaking.\n\nIn the elegantly tense and absorbing \u201cRed Sparrow,\u201d on the other hand, Jennifer Lawrence portrays a Russian spy who\u2019s a cunningly desperate human being \u2014 or, at least, enough of one that each scene rotates around the choices she makes, the way she appraises and seizes the destiny of the moment. Lawrence, in this movie, shows you what true screen stardom is all about. She plays a spy as someone who acts out a role, but does so (paradoxically) by acting as little as possible; she cues each scene to a different mood, leaving the audience in a constant state of discovery. We\u2019re on her side, but more than that we\u2019re in her head. Even when (of course) we\u2019re being played.\n\nDirected by Francis Lawrence, who made the last three \u201cHunger Games\u201d films, working from a script by Justin Haythe (based on the 2013 novel by Jason Matthews, a former C.I.A. operative) that taps the audience\u2019s intelligence rather than insulting it, \u201cRed Sparrow\u201d presents Lawrence\u2019s character, Dominika Egorova, as a victim who is cast into a state of peril she has to dig her way out of, one ominous chess move at a time. The movie is a thriller, but it\u2019s also a kind of sexualized nightmare, and that\u2019s the boldness of it. Dominika starts off as a prima ballerina with the Bolshoi Ballet, dancing before the glitterati of Moscow in a costume of resplendent red and gold. But her career is cut short by a horrific on-stage collision (not an accident, as we soon discover). It\u2019s here that she confronts what it means to be a pawn in the ruthless new Russian state (the same, it seems, as the old state). We also learn that when her fury flies, there will be blood.\n\nMore Reviews Album Review: 21 Savage's 'i am > i was' Film Review: 'American Renegades'\n\nTo Western eyes, Dominika lives in a very modest flat, which she shares with her mother (Joely Richardson), whom she\u2019s devoted to taking care of. But as soon as her dancing days end, she learns that she\u2019s going to be stripped of her health insurance and the apartment. It\u2019s a dread-ridden slipping-out-of-the-middle-class scenario, and it spurs her to take up the offer of her uncle, Ivan (Matthias Schoenaerts, gleaming like Vladimir Putin\u2019s bureaucrat-sociopath son), who happens to be the deputy director of Russia\u2019s external intelligence agency, the SVR. He will keep her afloat, as long as she agrees to carry out a mission.\n\nFor a relatively traditional spy thriller, \u201cRed Sparrow\u201d is more up-to-the-minute than it looks \u2014 more so, even, than the filmmakers must have known when they were making it. Dominika\u2019s mission, in which she\u2019s assigned to bed a shady businessman in a gilded hotel room, plays like a Harvey Weinstein nightmare. She winds up witnessing a murder, which means that she herself will be eliminated unless she agrees to become a recruit at State School 4, a training ground for what are known as the Sparrows. As presented, they are undercover prostitutes from hell.\n\nThat sounds like a clich\u00e9, and maybe a sexist one. But \u201cRed Sparrow\u201d is actually a lively critique of the Mata Hari-as-dominatrix scenario it presents to us. It\u2019s about a heroine who has had her choices cut off by a thug patriarchy. The training school, run by the ultimate icy headmistress, played in sadistic high style by Charlotte Rampling, amounts to a series of encounter sessions in which the recruits are stripped down in every possible way. They\u2019re reduced to being utensils (\u201cYour body belongs to the state,\u201d says Rampling), which they learn to manipulate. Lawrence makes her nakedness dramatic; she plays Dominika as shamed and proud at the same time. The film presents her new, transactional relationship to sexuality as a pop projection of the torments that women have endured, and there\u2019s a resonance to that. When James Bond sleeps with someone, it\u2019s all part of the hedonistic sport of the spying life. In \u201cRed Sparrow,\u201d it\u2019s quite the opposite. Dominika deeply resents her \u201cwhore school\u201d training. The men she faces add up to a conspiracy \u2014 sexual harassment as the dark underbelly of tradecraft.\n\nShe is sent to Budapest to have a \u201cchance\u201d encounter with Nate Nash (Joel Edgerton), an American C.I.A. operative who has cultivated a mole high up in the Russian regime. We brace ourselves for another clich\u00e9: the tale of two spies who swoon for each other \u2014 and who, by the way, is using whom? But \u201cRed Sparrow\u201d is an espionage thriller that\u2019s more clever than it first appears. It contains a romantic spark (or, at least, a semi-smoldering ember), but Dominika and Nash quickly figure out everything there is to know about each other. And so the film keeps you guessing as to what\u2019s at stake.\n\nThe basic set-up is simple enough (will Dominika sniff out the mole?), but \u201cRed Sparrow\u201d has enough tangles and reversals to be a fully satisfying night out. It\u2019s more talk than action, in a gratifyingly unfolding way. At one point, Dominika joins forces with the Americans, leading to the film\u2019s most suspenseful sequence, which features Mary-Louise Parker as a neurotic lush who\u2019s the turncoat chief of staff for a U.S. senator. The double-crossing isn\u2019t movieish and abstract \u2014 it\u2019s scruffy, rooted in desperation and raw appetite. Edgerton makes Nash a down-to-earth operative, noble in his impulses but far from a superman. And Lawrence\u2019s Dominika is gripping, because she has to keep improvising. She\u2019s been trained to survive, and does, wriggling out of everything from extreme torture to gross come-ons from her boss. But is she calling the shots, or are the shots calling her?\n\nLawrence, with regal cheekbones and voluptuous bangs, has a great Slavic look, and eases into the soul of playing a Russian. She does it with an unobtrusive accent, though you wish the rest of the cast had followed suit. Jeremy Irons, as a Russian general, doesn\u2019t even try for the accent (though he\u2019s still very good). Schoenaerts does (sort of), and acts with a swinish glee, playing a character who\u2019s even creepier than we imagine (he\u2019s been fixated on Dominika since she was a child). There are no clips of Putin, and he isn\u2019t even referred to by name, yet he\u2019s a presence in this movie; he\u2019s the demigod of a corruption that the rest of the characters are acting out. For the first time in a long while, a thriller revives Cold War tensions in a way that doesn\u2019t feel corny, since the Russians, in \u201cRed Sparrow,\u201d are standing in for the new world order: a global marketplace of people selling themselves. It\u2019s no wonder spying is trickier than ever. After a century of espionage, even the most undercover impulses are now out in the open, if not downright naked."}

I\u2019ve cut myself slack, which is a new thing for me.\u201d\n\nHe labels his current workouts as mid-intensity with a longer time domain, \u201cmeaning I\u2019m working out a little longer to condition more heart, to keep my heart rate up\u2014that\u2019s what I learned in my cardiac rehab,\u201d continues Harper. \u201cThey want me to keep my heart rate up for about 30 to 45 minutes, but not too intense.\u201d\n\nPlus, he\u2019s added other forms of exercise to his lifestyle. \u201cI walk a lot with my dogs [Karl and Vivienne] here in the city [New York City], I\u2019m doing a lot of yoga, and I\u2019ve been wanting to incorporate boxing\u2014that\u2019s my challenge for 2018.\u201d And he\u2019s no longer sweating it out every single day (he averages about five days a week). \u201cI used to be very regimented\u2014I knew how I was going to work out on Monday, I knew what I was going to do every day following. But now it\u2019s a little more relaxed.\u201d\n\nHe takes time each day to focus on inner calmness.\n\nA three-time New York Times bestselling author, Harper regularly practices transcendental meditation (TM), which involves silently repeating a mantra in order to place your body in a state of profound rest and allow your mind to achieve a sense of peace, as defined by the Mayo Clinic. \u201cTM, yoga, and my dogs really help me with managing my stress,\u201d he emphasizes. \u201cI tell people you have to find whatever it is in your life that you can do to turn off the white noise, just for a few minutes. If it means sitting with your phone off for five or ten minutes and not having to focus on anyone or anything\u2014 those things are so good for you. It helps your brain, it helps your body.\u201d\n\nHe is living in the moment.\n\nAnother similar lesson Harper has learned over the last year is to be present in the present. He recalls suffering from depression and an identity crisis early in his recovery since his only goal was to hit the gym hard once again.\n\nBob Harper on Biggest Loser, season 17. Getty Images\n\n\u201cI felt like beating my fist up again the wall because I wasn\u2019t able to do it,\u201d he confesses. \u201cAll I wanted to do in my recovery was get back to work and what I thought was normal again\u2026 I was the fitness guy\u2014I went to the gym for social, I went to the gym for fitness, I went for stress, I went for all these things. And when my doctors took that away from me after my heart attack, I didn\u2019t know what to do with myself.\u201d\n\n\n\nYet he discovered that \u201cthe universe had a way of self-adjusting\u201d his perspective on life. \u201cI understand now that I\u2019m more than just the fitness guy\u2014I\u2019m more than that,\u201d he continues. \u201cAnd that was kind of liberating to come to that conclusion.\u201d Today, he relies on a special piece of jewelry that encourages him to be mindful. \u201cI have this bracelet that I wear all the time that says, \u2018Be Here Now.\u2019 It\u2019s that touchstone that says, \u2018Okay, I can\u2019t stress about the big things or the small things.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe leans on his medical team.\n\nPrior to February 2017, Harper would head to the doctor\u2019s office for a routine physical exam every now and then. \u201cI didn\u2019t see doctors very much and I would kind of get nervous when I\u2019d go to the doctor,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd now, I\u2019m very comforted by having a doctor. I\u2019m working with a team of doctors that have become a part of my life that are guiding me through this new journey.\u201d\n\nSomething else that is also \u201ccompletely new\u201d for him is taking medication. \u201cOne of the things that was a really big wake-up call for me after I had a heart attack was when my doctors told me I\u2019d be more likely to have another heart attack within the first year,\u201d states Harper. \u201cI said, \u2018Okay, you tell me what I need to do.\u2019\u201d He was instructed to leave the hospital with BRILINTA, a prescription drug for heart attack treatment. Today, Harper is working with AstraZeneca, the company that distributes the med. \u201cTeaming up with them has been very personal for me because I am a heart attack survivor. It was such an organic fit.\u201d\n\nAnd he hopes his experience will inspire others to establish a relationship with their physician. \u201dI remember Savanah Guthrie from the TODAY show reached out to me and said, \u2018When I heard this happened to you, I immediately went to my doctor,\u2019\u201d he concludes. \u201cI thought that was so powerful because I want people to be proactive. I don\u2019t want you to just look in the mirror and say, \u2018Damn, I look good.\u2019 I want you to be able to see your doctor and make sure that you are good.\u201d"}

Jenelle wore an off-the-shoulder white dress with lace detail to symbolize that she\u2019s the bride, and she stopped to pose in front of rows and rows of racks filled with gorgeous wedding dresses. \u201cIt\u2019s finally happening!\u201d she wrote, and she later revealed that she chose a dress.\n\nNext, she shared a photo of her wedding dress shopping squad, posing with two unidentified brunettes.

{"label": true, "txt": "If the ending of Avengers: Infinity War left you fucked up for the rest of the day (or week) then you may once again find yourself in a state of emotional vulnerability when the tentatively titled Avengers 4 comes out next May, at least according to the Scarlet Witch.\n\nWe say that because Elizabeth Olsen stated as much (though unlike Mark Ruffalo she kept it vague) during this past weekend's ACE ComicCon in Chicago, where she was on hand with Tom Hiddleston/Loki to answer fan questions about the billion dollar series. Anyway, this would be a good time to mention there are spoilers in the rest of this post, though it's likely you already know or don't care if you haven't seen Infinity War by now.\n\nAccording to Comicbook.com, Olsen and Hiddleston were talking about the bleak ending to that film, and the sacrifices each of their characters made, when Hiddleston referred to Scarlet Witch killing her ill-fated lover, Vision, to prevent Thanos from acquiring the Mind Stone. While she was able to destroy it (which killed Vision), Thanos figured out a way to assemble his Infinity Gauntlet by using the Time Stone to reverse those actions to get the Mind Stone anyway (while also killing Vision a second time in front of her, damn). As if that wasn't bad enough, Scarlet Witch was also one of the people who disintegrates at the end.\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\nWhile that would seem like a harsh fate, it was at that point that Olsen told the crowd: \"It\u2019s only going to get worse.\"\n\nOlsen had previously stated that the plot was kept a secret from the cast until the directing Russo brothers, Joe and Anthony, shot it. But since that work's been done, and re-shoots have been completed, the cast is now aware of how things turn out.\n\n\"I found out from the Russos exactly what was going to happen, and it wasn\u2019t until we shot it on that day we learned what the ending was,\" Olsen said. \"They took us into a van \u2013 all of us \u2013 we were in a van with air conditioning because it was very hot, and they told us how the movie was going to end, and no one knew. And they were like \u2018Now we\u2019re shooting it, Go!\u2019 and we were like \u2018How are we supposed to interpret that?\u2019\"\n\nMarvel Studios boss Kevin Feige also said that the film will conclude the past decade of Marvel films that have been building to this moment. \"The entire intention of Infinity War and the next Avengers film next year was to have an ending \u2014 to bring a conclusion to 10-plus years, 22-movie narrative in a way that hadn\u2019t been done before in this particular type of film,\" he said to Uproxx. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean the MCU is coming to a close, by any means. But it means the narrative that started when we began 10 years ago will have a conclusion.\u201d\n\nPOST CONTINUES BELOW\n\nSo it would seem that all this line from Olsen could do was prep you to emote if you're the type of person who does that sort of thing at movie theaters. Or, we guess, it could also lead to you being sorely disappointed if the next Avengers doesn't line up with the sky high expectations that they've set themselves up for. Either/or.\n\nIt also falls in line with the tone of Avengers-related news that has seeped out, including a prediction that Tony Stark will die (from Iron Man writer Bob Layton), and also Chris Evans' Twitter message about playing Captain America.\n\nThe movie comes out on May 3, 2019 so...the hype hasn't really even started yet is what we're saying."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Over his nearly two-decade career, Nick Cannon has accomplished more than most celebrities\u2014let alone former child stars\u2014do in a lifetime.\n\nCannon is a rapper, an actor, a comedian, a director, a screenwriter, and a radio and television personality. Whether it\u2019s in the classic Drumline or the less classic Drumline: A New Beat, Cannon is always working.\n\nAnd while he\u2019s always been a multitasker, the 36-year-old has recently upped the ante when it comes to creative productivity. The star\u2019s recent decision to part ways with America\u2019s Got Talent has left Cannon with even more time to devote to his passion projects, like helming the Wild \u2019N Out reboot at MTV and working on new music.\n\nOne of Cannon\u2019s many passions recently led him to Kingston, Jamaica, where he was inspired by the local dancehall scene. Believing that this story had yet to reach a mainstream audience, Cannon wrote, directed, executive produced, and starred in a musical drama called King of the Dancehall, premiering on YouTube Red on Aug. 2.\n\nNaturally, when Nick Cannon single-handedly wills a dancehall drama into being, that film also happens to star Whoopi Goldberg, Busta Rhymes, Louis Gossett Jr., and Kreesha Turner (and it shoots on location in Jamaica).\n\nArguably, it was Cannon\u2019s insistence on juggling multiple careers and personas that landed him in hot water earlier this year.\n\nWhile taping for his Showtime stand-up special, Cannon joked that he was losing his \u201cblack card\u201d because of America\u2019s Got Talent. The implication was that Cannon felt somehow controlled or censored by the expectations of the network hosting gig.\n\nNBC allegedly believed that the joke \u201cdisparaged their brand,\u201d and may have even gone so far as to threaten Cannon with termination. So the host of the wildly popular summer talent competition quit instead.\n\n\u201cThere is no amount of money worth my dignity or my integrity,\u201d Cannon wrote in a subsequent Facebook post. \u201cNot to get too detailed but this isn\u2019t the first time executives have attempted to \u2018put me in my place\u2019 for so called unruly actions\u2026 I will not stand for it. My moral principles will easily walk away from the millions of dollars they hang over my head.\u201d\n\nIn many ways, it\u2019s this insistence on creative autonomy at any cost that truly sets Nick Cannon apart.\n\nDuring a recent phone call with The Daily Beast, Cannon further articulated his \u201cboss\u201d mentality. We discussed King of the Dancehall, co-parenting with Mariah Carey, and his passion for show-stopping turbans.\n\nSo let\u2019s talk about King of the Dancehall, which you wrote, directed, executive produced, and starred in\u2014can you speak on your vision for this project?\n\nMore than anything it was just trying to shed light on the subculture of dancehall and Jamaica. I took a trip to Kingston and was inspired by the community so much, and I felt like there was never a story told on a mainstream platform about this world. So I figured they had all the Step Ups and the Dirty Dancings and all that, so why not have something specifically about dancehall? So I wrote it! And put it all together.\n\nDancehall is definitely having a mainstream moment right now with artists like Drake and Rihanna.\n\nYeah well that was the thing! I felt like people have been brought on to the culture for quite some time, but were never really paying homage or telling the true story of where everything comes from, the raw ideas or this actually being a lifestyle. So I wanted to do that in a big way so even more people have a chance to\u2014with Drake and Rihanna and the Justin Bieber song\u2014to actually know where that stuff came from.\n\nAnd how was shooting on location in Jamaica?\n\nIt was intense at times because it was just so raw. But we made it happen, it was an incredible experience.\n\nSo how does it feel to be doing Wild \u2019N Out again at MTV?\n\nIt\u2019s exciting! More than anything it\u2019s exciting. Again, it\u2019s something I created from nothing, with just an idea. So to see it be so successful and continue to be so successful almost 15 years later and hundreds of episodes later\u2014this generation and the previous generation. And we\u2019re expanding in so many different ways, different verticals, brick and mortar, sports bars, Wild \u2019N Out comedy clubs. And bringing out all the new talent that you see as well, just giving other people even more opportunities through the Wild \u2019N Out brand.\n\nIn the past you\u2019ve compared Wild \u2019N Out to Def Comedy Jam and In Living Color, and you\u2019ve certainly helped launch the careers of a bunch of comedians, and black comedians specifically.\n\nDefinitely\u2014this was the first place a lot of people were introduced to Katt Williams and Kevin Hart. Even people on SNL like Taran Killam and Pete Davidson, these are people who started their career on Wild \u2019N Out. It\u2019s been a great platform for young comedians and hip-hop culture. So I take pride in that, to be able to build up young talent and give them a platform.\n\nWild \u2019N Out is really unique in that you have these huge celebrities on, and they\u2019re actually willing to be honest and candid. I saw that episode you just did with Blac Chyna, and you guys really went there.\n\n(Laughs.) Yeah, I mean you just got to create an environment of fun. And an environment where no one\u2019s taking themselves too seriously. And so we offer them that. Cause everybody\u2019s handling everything with gravity, and we\u2019re like no, this is an environment where you can address things and address them in a way that says it\u2019s not as serious as everyone makes it. So you can have that fun\u2014and obviously usually I\u2019m the first to take it, I bear the brunt of everyone\u2019s jokes, and so everyone sees it like, \u201cHey, Nick\u2019s not tripping, so why should anyone else.\u201d\n\nSo if a celebrity came with a list of off-limits topics, would you not be about that?\n\nNah, that happens all the time! Sometimes people will come on and say please don\u2019t say anything about this and this, and we\u2019re sensitive to that. We\u2019re nice and professional people! So if you ask us not to talk about something, we\u2019ll follow the rules. We can be professional!\n\nWhen all of the stuff was going down with America\u2019s Got Talent, you wrote a statement that touched on the lack of minority executives in the entertainment industry, which is a huge issue, and the challenges of being a black artist in general\u2014do you feel like you\u2019ve seen any sort of progress on that front over the course of your career?\n\nDefinitely\u2026 We\u2019ve come a long way but we\u2019ve got a long way to go. A lot of times for me it\u2019s more about the mentality. When it comes to talent specifically, they have to \u201cknow their place\u201d or \u201cbe grateful to have the opportunity,\u201d and that\u2019s not for me at all. I\u2019m more about creating my own, and developing and owning and having equity, not only with studios and brands but with content, and owning IP, not just because that\u2019s where the money is, but that\u2019s where the power is as well. So I just don\u2019t like that employee mentality. I feel like I can\u2019t be an employee anymore, I aim to be a boss and an owner in everything that I do. So when someone puts me in a position where they want to treat me a certain way, and question me, then I have to step up.\n\nAt what point did you get so comfortable calling people out and asserting yourself like that?\n\n(Laughs.) You know what, I feel like I\u2019ve always been doing that? I just don\u2019t really care about the consequences, I care about staying true to myself. So it wasn\u2019t like, \u201cOh I\u2019ve reached a certain point and now I can do it.\u201d I\u2019ve always done it. And luckily I am in a position where even when there are consequences\u2026 like I\u2019m no longer working on America\u2019s Got Talent, but there are other jobs, so it doesn\u2019t really phase me.\n\nYou mean you don\u2019t need the money.\n\nRight. Pretty much!\n\nOK, shifting from a serious issue to sort of a silly one: The internet went sort of wild when you were spotted at the Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show wearing a turban\u2014were you surprised that everyone was tweeting about it and all that? Because you\u2019ve been wearing turbans for a while now, right?\n\nYeah, it\u2019s been a minute. I mean I guess I\u2019m a stylish person, but I never really set out to make a statement and style with it. It\u2019s more of a cultural thing, but I guess it\u2019s part of my style too. I never really give that stuff too much attention\u2014when it comes to being flamboyant, it\u2019s like, why not? Why not rock a pink turban?\n\nDoes it upset you when people judge you on the internet, or have you been famous for so long that you actually don\u2019t read the comments?\n\nI definitely read the comments! I read it, laugh at it, and put it on Wild \u2019N Out, most of the time! That\u2019s great banter. And none of that stuff really phases me because it\u2019s not real life. It\u2019s stuff that you can always laugh at. I always say I\u2019m not worried about other people\u2019s opinions, I just laugh and keep it moving and then do it all over again.\n\nThere is constant speculation about how you and your ex-wife (Mariah Carey) have managed to remain such close friends and co-parents even after your split\u2014from the outside, it just looks like a really healthy relationship. How have you managed to stay so close with your ex? What\u2019s the secret?\n\nIt\u2019s really just about unconditional love, taking your ego out of the situation and understanding that that\u2019s how it goes. You\u2019ve moved on, but at the end of the day you\u2019ve got to raise children. It\u2019s pretty simple when you think about it.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem so simple though!\n\nYou\u2019re right\u2014you can make it hard or you can just deal with it and embrace it, and I think everybody\u2019s coming from a positive place.\n\nAre you sick of having to constantly address rumors that you\u2019re getting back together?\n\nYeah, I mean there\u2019s a rumor about that every week, there\u2019s a rumor about who I\u2019m dating. There are so many rumors that I don\u2019t even pay attention to it anymore.\n\nUnless they\u2019re really funny.\n\nExactly. I try to find the humor in it.\n\nSo what other projects are you working on right now?\n\nI\u2019m focusing on music. I have so much free time after America\u2019s Got Talent, that used to take up my entire summer, and so now I\u2019ve just been focusing\u2014I\u2019ve got a hot record out right now with Quavo called \u201cDream Girl\u201d that\u2019s been shooting up the charts. Aside from that I\u2019ve been DJ\u2019ing and building up the Wild \u2019N Out brand like I told you, getting all that together and getting ready for the next season, so I\u2019ve been busier than ever. Obviously the film is coming out and then I\u2019m working on another film, doing the same thing, writing, financing, shooting everything but this one takes place in Inglewood, California, and it\u2019s a basketball film about female street ball called She-ball. So that\u2019s kind of cool.\n\nWhere do you think your sound is at right now? Because you\u2019ve obviously been making music for a while.\n\nI\u2019m always going to be influenced by gospel music because that\u2019s my favorite type of music. The older stuff I\u2019m always going to be influenced by. But the stuff I\u2019m vibing with, that I\u2019m loving out there right now, is everything from Kehlani, who\u2019s actually one of my artists that I discovered, to everything that\u2019s going on in the hip-hop scene, from Kendrick to Chance to Migos. Those are the guys I\u2019m paying close attention to because that\u2019s who I\u2019m chasing right now.\n\nAnd are you still enrolled at Howard University?\n\nI am!

Even 13 years after the release of the original film, stars Blake Lively, America Ferrera, Amber Tamblyn, and Alexis Bledell still seem to be as close as ever. Last May, the foursome gathered at Tamblyn's directorial debut, an indie called Paint It Black, and this week they came together once again to support one of their own: this time Ferrera. Two days after the Ugly Betty star announced that she and her husband, director Ryan Piers Williams, are expecting their first child, she and her former co-stars turned friends reunited to celebrate.\n\nOf course, it wouldn't be a real reunion with documentation and, as such, Ferrera shared a photo of the occasion. In it, the four women cozy up on a couch with all of their hands on the pregnant actress' stomach. \"Starting the New Year off with blessings from my Sisterhood,\" Ferrera wrote in the caption on Instagram. \"We\u2019ve got work to do for the next generation. Let\u2019s get to it. #TIMESUP\"\n\nLoading View on Instagram\n\nFerrera previously announced her pregnancy on Instagram in a New Year's photo with Williams where the pair showed off a baby onesie that said \"m\u00e1s besos (por favor)\" (translation: \"more kisses please\"). \"We\u2019re welcoming one more face to kiss in 2018!,\" she wrote. \"Wishing you #M\u00e1sBesos in the New Year! #babybesos #HappyNewYear \ud83d\ude18\"\n\nLoading View on Instagram\n\nAs for whether or not Ferrera, Lively, Tamblyn and Bledel would reunite for the big screen once again, it seems like it's just a matter of time until they do. News of a third Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants film first spread back in 2014 when Variety revealed that a threequel was officially in the works with Dawson's Creek writer Liz Garcia in charge of adapting the novel \u2014 specifically the fifth and final one, Sisterhood Everlasting, as the sequel was adapted from the second, third and fourth books. Plus, last fall Tamblyn teased to Entertainment Weekly , \u201cI have very high hopes for it happening sooner rather than later.\u201d Ferrera has said the same, telling E! News , \"It's an idea and a conversation. I think it would be amazing. The sisterhood is still well and alive. I love my girls. We're very much a part of each other's lives and if the movie happens it would be a great thing.\"\n\nRelated: Natalie Portman Has Finally Joined Instagram\u2014and Already Entirely Devoted Her Account to Taking Action Against Sexual Assault\n\n13 Celebrities Reveal Their Favorite Toys Growing Up"}
{"label": true, "txt": "The director says he was accused of rape at college, has settled a harassment claim and has been unfaithful to \u2018every wife and girlfriend\u2019 he has had\n\nFilm-maker Morgan Spurlock has admitted to acts of sexual misconduct in an open letter, describing himself as \u201cpart of the problem\u201d .\n\nIn a lengthy statement posted on Twitter, the Super Size Me director revealed that he was once accused of rape and had settled a sexual harassment claim made by a female employee. Spurlock also admitted to being \u201cunfaithful to every wife and girlfriend I have ever had\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs I sit around watching hero after hero, man after man, fall at the realisation of their past indiscretions, I don\u2019t sit by and wonder \u2018who will be next?\u2019 I wonder, \u2018when will they come for me?\u2019\u201d Spurlock wrote.\n\nThe director said that the allegation of rape occurred while he was at college. While no charges or investigations were brought against him, the claimant named Spurlock in an essay on the incident that was read aloud in class.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, we\u2019d been drinking all night and went back to my room,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe began fooling around, she pushed me off, then we laid in the bed and talked and laughed some more, and then began fooling around again. We took off our clothes. She said she didn\u2019t want to have sex, so we laid together, and talked, and kissed, and laughed, and then we started having sex.\u201d\n\nWhen the woman then started to cry Spurlock said that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know what to do. We stopped having sex and I rolled beside her. I tried to comfort her. To make her feel better. I thought I was doing ok, I believed she was feeling better. She believed she was raped.\u201d\n\nMorgan Spurlock (@MorganSpurlock) I am Part of the Problem\n\n\n\nRead: https://t.co/MfRAtm3fcv\n\nSpurlock said the allegation of harassment was made by an office assistant in 2009, and that he had paid a sum to settle it.\n\n\u201cI would call my female assistant \u2018hot pants\u2019 or \u2018sex pants\u2019 when I was yelling to her from the other side of the office. Something I thought was funny at the time, but then realized I had completely demeaned and belittled her to a place of non-existence.\n\n\u201cSo, when she decided to quit, she came to me and said if I didn\u2019t pay her a settlement, she would tell everyone. Being who I was, it was the last thing I wanted, so of course, I paid. I paid for peace of mind. I paid for her silence and cooperation. Most of all, I paid so I could remain who I was,\u201d he said.\n\nThe director said that he had been the victim of sexual abuse as a child, and had a drinking problem. He concluded the letter by promising to \u201cdo better. The only individual I have control over is me. So starting today, I\u2019m going to be more honest with you and myself. I\u2019m going to lay it all out in the open. Maybe that will be a start. Who knows. But I do know I\u2019ve talked enough in my life. I\u2019m finally ready to listen.\u201d\n\nThe admission by Spurlock follows a number of sexual abuse allegations made against men in the entertainment industry, including James Toback, Kevin Spacey and Harvey Weinstein. In an essay published by the New York Times on Wednesday, actor Salma Hayek joined more than 90 women in accusing Weinstein of sexual assault. The producer denies any claims of non-consensual sex made against him."}

She beat out SZA, Julia Michaels, Khalid and Lil Uzi Vert for the honor.\n\nComing into tonight, the singer was up for four prizes in her first year at the Grammys\u2014Best New Artist, Song of the Year, Best Short Form Music Video and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.\n\nShe first broke into the mainstream with her debut single \u201cHere,\u201d which took its time reaching its No. 5 peak in America. Not long after that song performed well, her debut full-length Know-It-All was released, and it managed to start inside the top 10 in the U.S. She went on to send another single from the record, \u201cScars To Your Beautiful,\u201d to the top 10, and her Zedd collaboration \u201cStay\u201d also broke into the region.\n\nWhile she is clearly one of the most talented and promising young musicians out there, it is odd that Cara was nominated at all, given the tight restrictions that govern what year artists can be up for this trophy. Since her debut album (the one that made her well-known to the public) was released in November 2015, she should have been eligible for Best New Artist at the 2017 Grammys, where she wasn\u2019t nominated for anything. That controversy was seemingly never addressed by the Academy, though there may be some questions now that she has not only been nominated, but has taken the gold.\n\nWhile all five names nominated this time around have contributed to popular culture and proven themselves to be incredibly talented individuals, Cara\u2019s win is deserved, and it\u2019s difficult to argue against the Academy\u2019s decision, difficult as it must have been to make."}

Family are coming into town from all over the place and it\u2019s up to them to facilitate getting them together in time for the wedding. Penny is in charge of grabbing Amy\u2019s parents from the airport while Raj is tasked with grabbing Sheldon\u2019s mom and sister Missy. As the trio drive, Mrs. Cooper reveals that Missy is pregnant with her second baby and notes that her husband is at home watching their first child. Missy, however, reveals that they\u2019re actually separated and her mom just can\u2019t deal.\n\nMeanwhile, Howard is in his living room playing with a dog that wandered into his backyard. Bernadette is about to chastise him for adding another member to the already-crowded household, but he tells her he\u2019s already called the owner to come retrieve the little guy. When the doorbell rings, he\u2019s shocked to discover that he\u2019s holding none other than \u201cStar Wars\u201d star Mark Hamill\u2019s pooch. The star offers Howard a reward for finding his dog, Bark Hamill, but Howard says he can\u2019t accept money.\n\nInstead, he asks Hamill to officiate the wedding, stealing the job away from Sheldon\u2019s former rival, Wil Wheaton. Wheaton takes the news poorly, due in large part to the fact that Howard waited until the day of the wedding to break it to him. He approaches Hamill and tells him that he was awake all night working on notes for the wedding.\n\n\u201cThanks, this\u2019ll be a big help!\u201d an oblivious Hamill says, walking off with Wheaton\u2019s notebook.\n\nThe episode cuts to Leonard doing his best to straighten Sheldon\u2019s bowtie and getting emotional.

She mentions Sheldon\u2019s dad and how he\u2019d be proud of him before trying to fix the tie herself. However, Sheldon stops her noting that Amy said sometimes a little asymmetry is a good thing. That\u2019s when he gets a sudden burst of inspiration with regard to his work. He throws tradition to the wind and goes to Amy\u2019s dressing room and explains his breakthrough and the couple starts to work on it.\n\nOutside, as the guests wait for the ceremony to start, Howard asks Hamill to host an impromptu Q&A about \u201cStar Wars\u201d to help fill the time. This holds over everyone except Amy\u2019s brash mother, who assumes Sheldon has walked out and stands up to go retrieve her daughter. This, however, is something Penny doesn\u2019t allow. She finally stands up to the old woman telling her that Sheldon loves Amy and would never, under any circumstances, hurt her.\n\nEventually, Penny personally goes in back to see what\u2019s up, only to find Leonard has joined their calculations and can confirm that they\u2019re onto something world-changing. Penny, though, is completely unamused.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s right, we have our whole lives to do science together,\u201d Sheldon says. \u201cLet\u2019s get married.\u201d\n\nAs they walk down the aisle, Sheldon is shocked to see his wedding will be officiated by Hamill, and notes that he has literally 4,000 things for him to sign afterwards. That\u2019s when the big moment comes.\n\nAmy walks down the aisle and the two exchange vows.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a little girl, I used to dream about my wedding, but eventually I stopped because I thought that day would never come. And then I met you. From the first moment in that coffee shop, I knew that there was something special between us. Even though I did work on a study that disproved love at first sight,\u201d Amy says. \u201cClearly it was wrong, because I felt something that day and those feelings have only gotten stronger with time. I can\u2019t imagine loving you more than I do right now, but I felt that way yesterday and the day before yesterday and the day before that.\u201d\n\nThen it\u2019s Sheldon\u2019s turn, and the man who doesn\u2019t understand social interaction knew that acknowledging he didn\u2019t know what to say was the perfect thing to say.\n\n\u201cin this moment\u2026 I have no words. I guess I\u2019m overwhelmed by you. In a good way\u2026 Not in the elevator in the Haunted Mansion way. Even if I can\u2019t tell you now how I feel\u2026 I will spend my life showing you how much I love you.\u201d\n\nWith that, a visibly choked up Hamill finally said the words fans have been waiting many years to hear and pronounced Sheldon and Amy husband and wife."}

When Joss decides it's time, we'll do it,\" Newman explains. \"And until Joss decides it's time, it won't happen.\"\n\nHow big a role Whedon would play in any sort of revival or reboot is anyone's guess, but it's reassuring to know that the studio wouldn't move forward with it unless he signed on. Of course, given that Whedon recently left his role as writer and director of a potential Batgirl movie, perhaps a return to the small screen is in his future.\n\nWhy wait for a Buffy reboot or a revival with the original cast, though?

When she speaks, she's in your face, she's in your head, she's in your heart. I feel like I'm married to her,\" Fredrik recently shared with The Daily Dish about his friendship with Bethenny. \"And we joke about that, like that I'm her gay husband. There is a really loving friendship at the bottom of it, and now there's this business venture.\"\n\nFredrik is, of course, referring to his upcoming series with Bethenny, Bethenny and Fredrik, where he and The Real Housewives of New York City mogul will team up to invest in and transform multi-million dollar properties in the hopes of making some major moolah. And whenever you mix business with pleasure, drama is usually not far behind. \"I think I'm one of the few people \u2014 I think she would agree \u2014 that I don't take sh** from her,\" Fredrik explained. \"She tries to, and then I give her back exactly or even a little bit more [than] what she's trying to give to me.\"\n\nAnd the Million Dollar Listing New York agent is ready to assert his real estate expertise. \"She knows real estate.

Dubonnet is also widely known by the advertisement slogan of the French graphic designer Cassandre \"Dubo, Dubon, Dubonnet\" (a play on words roughly meaning \"It's nice; it's good; it's Dubonnet\"), which still can be found on the walls of houses in France.

{"label": true, "txt": "A beauty guru, murderer, and law student walk into a bar. The punchline is that it\u2019s just one person: Aja Naomi King, who plays Michaela Pratt on ABC's How To Get Away With Murder. Yes, she\u2019s an actress who makes up one fraction of the fictitious law student group that seems to keep accidentally committing those doggone murders with the help of Viola Davis\u2019 character Annalise Keating, but she also knows a thing or two about beauty. To put it in 2017 terms, if she decided to give up acting and start a YouTube channel, we would all be scrolling down to like and subscribe. \u201cI\u2019ve loved makeup for such a long time,\u201d explains King. \u201cI really got into it because it\u2019s that quiet time you sit with yourself and make yourself your own work of art. It\u2019s really beautiful.\u201d\n\nNow, ELLE.com can exclusively announce, Aja Naomi King is the newest spokesperson for L'Oreal Paris. The talented actress will join fellow L'Oreal ladies Elle Fanning, Blake Lively, Maria Borges, and Susan Sarandon.\n\nAhead of the first kickoff campaign with Aja for the True Match Lumi Collection, we jumped on the phone to talk beauty, Viola Davis and Shonda Rhimes, being seen, and beauty secrets from the set of How To Get Away With Murder. Read on to learn about the new beautiful talented #lorealista.\n\nCongrats on the new L\u2019Oreal Paris spokesperson role! What\u2019s it like to join the ranks of Julianne Moore, Susan Sarandon, Naomi Watt, Camila Cabello, Blake Lively, and Maria Borges?\n\nOh, my gosh, it\u2019s amazing. I'm so honored. All of those women evoke such elegance and style and they all have qualities of effortless beauty around them. To be put in that group of women and be thought of in that way, I'm just so immensely, overwhelmingly happy and honored to be counted amongst them.\n\nYou\u2019re on a series that allows black girls and women to see themselves represented and seen on TV, do you think that this is a valuable extension to that?\n\nYes, immensely valuable. Awhile ago Shonda Rhimes was inducted in the TV Hall of Fame and she said something that was so\u2014it just hit me in such a way, thinking about how L'Oreal was allowing me to join the ranks of these incredible women. What she said was: \"You cannot be what you cannot see.\" It's so true. When you look at a global brand like L'Oreal, to be a part of that vision, and to be put out there in the world for other young women to see me and see a reflection of themselves promoted in that way. It's so powerful because it really sends the message of look at all the wonderful things we can do.\n\nWhat other valuable lessons have you learned from Shonda? How did Viola react to the news of your spokesperson role?\n\nWhen it comes to Viola, she always makes me so happy, because any little thing that happens to me, she is just the biggest supporter and cheerleader. It's really wonderful. She\u2019s so supportive of me getting any kind of attention or recognition for anything. What's so great about her she is always is able to make it so clear, in a really impactful way, that these opportunities, they are rare things, and they don't always come around. To be able to be granted one and chosen in that way, just the value in that. She said these aren't the things that were possible when she was younger. When she looks at me, she is like, \"Look what you can do and what you are showing other people and be grateful for that because it's an immense responsibility.\" I do take it so seriously because someone else is going to see it and they are going to say to themselves, \u201cWow, that's me.\u201d I see myself in that person and now I see exactly what I'm capable of and there are no limits.\n\nTo me that's the most powerful thing, growing up and seeing all the things that Shonda Rhimes has done. We've all been taught there are no limits. The stories you can tell and the impact you can tell and the way you affect people's lives on a daily basis and create empathy and make them feel beautiful. When you put a women like Viola Davis on the screen and say, \u201cThis is our beauty icon, this is beautiful.\u201d The world stops and says, \u201cYes, we've been waiting for this.\u201d\n\nYou gave a wonderful speech at Essence Women in Hollywood about your personal struggle with self doubt. \u201cMy inner critic is strong, but I know that I am stronger.\u201d Does this do anything to quiet those doubts?\n\nI definitely think this does that. There is a voice inside of my head that is trying to convince me that I'm not good enough and that I don't deserve to be here. So courage is required. The courage to decide that I have a voice and need to do what I love. To believe that this opportunity is not wasted on me. To own the fact that I am worthy.\n\nWho are some of your beauty icons that inspire you?\n\nI always think of when I was younger my mother showed me the movie Lady Sings the Blues with Diana Ross. You should see that movie. She plays Billie Holiday in the film. Growing up I loved listening to Billie Holiday because her work is amazing and she was a black woman coming up in a time when it was difficult to amass that kind of opportunity. Diana Ross's portrayal of her really gave insights into both of these women.\n\nI've always kind of leaned more into looking at those older beauty icons, who really had to break all the boundaries to prove that they were beautiful. To have dark skin and curly hair was beautiful too. I look to them and still look to women like Eartha Kitt and Dorothy Dandridge who were so groundbreaking in their beauty.\n\nYour first collaboration with L'Oreal is the True Match Lumi Collection! What are some of your favorite products? What\u2019s in your beauty bag right now?\n\nTrue Match Lumi Glotion. It's my super go-to for my face.

It just layers on so great. I feel like it can fit with everything, whether you're going for a little or a lot, depending on how you apply the mascara, it can go a long way.\n\nCourtesy of L'Oreal\n\nL'Oreal Paris Voluminous Original Mascara, $7.99, ulta.com\n\n\n\nSHOP\n\nLet\u2019s talk about HTGAWM. Are you similar to your character Michaela Pratt? How does her beauty look differ from your everyday look?\n\nI\u2019m very similar to my character at this point, other than the whole murdering stuff. One of the things I really love about my character is that a little murder has never stopped Michaela from putting on makeup. Michaela wears makeup like she's about to walk on a red carpet. I love, love, love that. I\u2019ve been fighting for years now for my character to wear a lip color and finally this year they conceded and allowed it happen.\n\nIt seems like the law students get into some weird situations. What\u2019s the most dramatic look you did on the show, how was that done?\n\nThe weirdest makeup was a no makeup but a lot of blood scene. I actually posted a video of this on Instagram. The crew were just flinging blood on my face. I mean, fake blood.\n\nWhen we were shooting the scene, the crew had this catapult and a man sat there with a bowl of fake blood. When the gunshot went off in the scene, he let it go flying at me. It gets pretty insane over here.\n\nCan you any beauty secrets from HTGAWM that will give us hints about what\u2019s to come?\n\nHints are so dangerous. We are still filming so I need to remember the last thing that happened because I am not getting into trouble today. I\u2019ll say this much, Michaela is going to get her glow back. Nothing can hold her back and she cares about how she presents herself to the world."}
{"label": true, "txt": "\u201c This is Gilead. No one gets out. \u201d \u2014 Moira [1]\n\nRepublic of Gilead The banner of the Republic of Gilead as depicted in the TV series. Located within The Former United States Anthem America the Beautiful Capital Washington D.C. Largest City New York City Other Cities Boston, Los Angeles, Concord, etc. Language English Religion Gileadian Christianity Demonym Gileadian Government Theocracy Area 2,959,064.44 sq mi (7,663,941.7 km2) Location type Country Description Location\n\nThe Republic of Gilead, sometimes colloquially referred to simply as Gilead, is the authoritarian, theocratic regime that takes over the United States of America in The Handmaid's Tale. The regime can be seen as the overall main antagonist of the novel and the television adaptation.\n\nContents show]\n\nOrigins Edit\n\nSee also: The Takeover\n\nThe origin of the Republic of Gilead is not entirely clear, mostly because all information on it comes from the accounts of Offred, who has limited knowledge or can be seen as an unreliable narrator. It would seem that Gilead originally began as various religious extremist groups that believed that America needed to be 'saved' from sin and corruption. According to the conference transcript at the end of the novel, these coalesced into a single conspiracy which referred to itself as \"the Sons of Jacob\" led by its leader Samantha Ter[2].\n\nEventually, the Sons of Jacob devised and executed an elaborate coup d'etat against the United States government. Through a series of coordinated attacks, they assassinated the U.S. President and members of Congress (novel[3]), as well as staff from the White House and all nine Justices of the Supreme Court (TV Series[4]). Blaming the attacks on \"Islamic fanatics\", \"the army declared a state of emergency\"[3]. In quick succession, the United States Constitution was suspended, online bank accounts were frozen, and all employed women were fired from their jobs. Offred recalls that the entire coup happened so fast that the widespread emotion among the general population was bewilderment as the Sons of Jacob's own troops systematically cleared women out of places of employment[3]. There were a few protest marches at first, but the new Sons of Jacob government immediately responded with blunt, naked aggression; it deployed its own soldiers - the Guardians of the Faithful - to mercilessly slaughter the unarmed protesters rather than disperse them. After the first protests were quashed with such sheer brutality, the population was too terrified to mount any further reaction[3]. However, the Sons' actions against unarmed protesters would fan the flames of armed resistance with various rebel groups and citizen militia units across the country started to take up arms against the Sons of Jacob regime.\n\nThe new government began by quickly hunting down anyone they perceived as being \"unGodly\" or a threat. This included political activists, doctors, members of other religious groups and gender minorities, and intellectuals. The Republic of Gilead was declared as the successor state to the United States of America. However, at least some American civilian and military officials survived the coup and fled to Alaska, where they declared the new US capital in Anchorage, resulting in a Second American Civil War.\n\nGeography Edit\n\nIn the TV series, a scene from the Holly episode inside the Mackenzie household shows three maps along the wall. When searching for key to mr. Mackenzies carkeys, maps can be found behind Offred on the wall which show the opening, middle and later stages of the civil war between the US and Gilead. The end result being American forces largely being pushed off the Lower 48 states.\n\nA map revealed during an event for the season 2 finale revealed the full extent of the Republic of Gilead. It has largely taken control of most of what was the United States with the eastern, northeastern, and mid-western parts of the country being in Gilead hands (as evident with these particular areas being in a shade of blue on the map), but anti-Gilead/pro-US forces have retained control of the entire West Coast and the Gulf Coast including most of Texas and all of Florida. Rebel forces also control a large tract of territory along the Canadian border and northern Michigan along with an enclave in New England centering around Vermont, and parts of New Hampshire, Maine and New York state.\n\nOffred mentions in her inner monologue in Episode 2 that \"Guardians of the Faithful and American soldiers still fight with tanks in the remains of Chicago\",[5] confirming that the Second American Civil War is still ongoing.\n\nIn addition to this, the official United States governmment operating out of Anchorage has total control over Alaska and Hawaii. Their level of influence over the rebel-held areas of the former US, such as California and Texas, remains to be seen.\n\nAreas euphemistically termed \"the Colonies\" exist, which have been ecologically contaminated - apparently due to a mixture of industrial pollution, chemical/radiological accidents, and chemical/possibly-nuclear warfare. The Colonies are located in what was once the American mid-west and south-west. Gilead condemned criminals to slave-labor on cleanup projects in the Colonies, which is essentially a death sentence[2].\n\nNot much is known about the foreign relations of Gilead, due to extreme media censorship. It can be assumed that the vast majority of the world sees the Republic of Gilead as an illegitimate regime and still sees the United States government-in-exile as the true legitimate government of America (the TV series mention a UN embargo against Gilead[6]). The United Kingdom has placed sanctions on Gilead and raised the cap on American refugees relocating from Canada, according to \"Radio Free America\". In Season 2's episode Smart Power, Canada cuts off economic relations with Gilead following the publishing of the letters within Rachel's Package.\n\nRefugees from Gilead attempt escape to Canada or Europe, which are apparently still free societies with minimal influence from Gilead. Several \"Save the Women\" campaigns exist in England for former Handmaids who have managed to flee[2].\n\nSociety and politics Edit\n\nLittle is known of how Gilead's government functions; as its official name contains the term \"Republic,\" it can be assumed that the country has a Senate or similar governing body. In the TV series, these governing bodies are referred as the \"Committee\" [1], or (on a local level) \"Council\" as a board of local Commanders, with Commander Pryce as its current chairman[7]. There's strong evidence the Republic of Gilead abolished America's federal system of government and states, and has become a unitary republic with a centralized government. One piece of evidence to this can be found in Episode 6 of the 2017 TV series with the Mexican ambassador's aide telling June/Offred that her husband Luke is still alive in Canada by mentioning his details and place of birth, in which the aide said \"former New York state\"[4].\n\nIn the early years of Gilead, the nation's new leaders (in the form of the Sons of Jacob) were from amongst the regime's earliest supporters. When the Sons of Jacob established the Republic of Gilead, the new regime suspended and eliminated the United States Constitution and all the rights and liberties the citizens of the United States had and enjoyed e.g. freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of religion, the right to keep and bear arms, freedom of assembly, freedom of choice, the right to a fair trial in a court of law, protection from cruel and unusual punishments etc[3].\n\nGilead has a strict class system and hierarchy, with everyone being assigned to a particular class and expected to fulfill certain roles. The high-ranking men who govern Gilead are known as Commanders of the Faithful. The Eyes serve as Gilead's police force and spies. Guardians serve as bodyguards, security officers and personal drivers to Commanders, while Angels serve as soldiers and can become high-ranking if they serve their country well. In regard to the majority of the male population in Gilead, they are now classified as Econopeople and it appears they are treated no differently from slave laborers with the majority of men in Gilead wearing clothes in the same dull green/grey color scheme as the Marthas.\n\nGilead is a patriarchal society, with only men having access to education and holding political positions. Women are regarded as second-class citizens as they cannot hold property or be employed, and must submit to the authority of men. Women, except for Aunts, are forbidden to read or write. The lowest class of women are probably Econowives, who are wed to poor or low-ranking men and must fulfill all functions of a Gileadean woman[8]. Wives are probably the highest-ranking women, though they still remain oppressed. Unwomen and similar criminals or \"infidels\" are not considered citizens at all. Wives and Aunts are of higher social classes, having a considerable amount of influence, power and control over the people under them to the point that some of the high-ranking men of Gilead are afraid of them. One example of the Wives' power and influence with the Commanders is the amount of influence Naomi Putnam had over Commander Pryce in having her husband's left hand amputated for his transgressions with Janine. Another example of the Aunts' power and influence can be seen when Aunt Lydia beat and tortured Offred with a cattle prod during an interrogation by The Eyes of her interactions with Ofglen. During the interrogation, the Eye carrying out the interrogation didn't intervene in stopping Aunt Lydia from assaulting Offred.\n\nGilead is a strict, totalitarian regime that bases its laws and customs around a very literal, fundamentalist interpretation of the Christian Bible, in particular the Old Testament. Hence, much of their teachings and legislation are influenced by their own rigid interpretation of scripture.\n\nThe law is absolute in Gilead. Any rule-breaking or subversion must be reported and is harshly punished. Criminals are often executed and their bodies displayed as a warning; the Eyes also use torture and other brutal interrogation tactics on their prisoners.\n\nAll citizens must follow Gilead's own official version of Christianity. No other religion or belief system is tolerated; as Gilead rose to power, those of other faiths and of other Christian denominations were forced to convert on pain of imprisonment or death. Jewish people were given the choice of converting, or leaving for Israel. It is implied in the novel that those who chose to leave were actually killed in secret.\n\nExecutions are referred to as \"Salvagings\" and are held in public. Women are executed by hanging, with Handmaids being given the rope to hang the condemned together, thus sharing in the \"responsibility\" of punishing the wicked. Those that are spared execution can be sent to the toxic Colonies, where life is short and brutal. The Colonies are often polluted by rubbish and radioactive waste, and those sent there are tasked with cleaning up, eventually falling ill and dying slowly and painfully. Some regard being sent to the Colonies as a fate worse than death. Other punishments meted out to those who break Gilead's laws include the surgical removal/amputation of body parts e.g. fingers, hands and eyes.\n\nThe media and the news are heavily censored, and often include propaganda to promote the ideals and values of Gilead, whilst demonizing their enemies. As a result, it is difficult to obtain reliable information. To discourage women from reading, public writings or names of any kind, including shop signs, are removed. Information is instead relayed by signs with pictures or pictograms. Any secular artwork, films, music, television programs, books and any published materials are banned outright and anybody in possession of such items are punished severely, e.g. sentenced to death.\n\nGilead's names for shops, streets and certain concepts or practices are often derived from scripture. The name Gilead itself is taken from the Bible, referring to several different locations and individuals and generally translated as \"hill of testimony.\"\n\nKnown classes Edit\n\nMen Edit\n\nWomen Edit\n\nWife\n\nAunt\n\nHandmaid\n\nMartha\n\nEconowife\n\nUnwomen\n\nJezebels\n\nValues and beliefs Edit\n\nIt is most likely that the leaders of Gilead are an extremist Christian cult. They believe that their strict interpretation of the Bible is the absolute truth, and that in order for people to achieve salvation and live a pure, godly life, they must follow these. To do otherwise is seen as living in sin, and the guilty must either repent, or be eradicated to prevent them from spreading their evil influence to others.\n\nWomen are believed to be the \"lesser\" sex, who should be subject to men. Women's main purpose in this society is bearing and raising children, which is given particular emphasis due to the possible rampant infertility present in North America at the time. Women are not allowed to participate in the government, be educated, hold property or have a career. By law, only women can be considered infertile, not men, thus placing the blame for the fertility crisis solely on women. Because of these beliefs, men cannot \"factually\" be infertile, even if this is the case; to suggest otherwise is heresy.\n\nModesty and purity in all areas of life are greatly emphasised, particularly for women, who are believed to be more prone to weakness of character and sin. Abortion and contraception are considered some of the greatest sins. Doctors who performed abortions before Gilead's establishment are executed. Adultery or fraternization between men and women is viewed as \"fornication\" and is punishable by death for all involved. Homosexuality, referred to as \"Gender Treachery,\" is considered a sin and a crime punishable by death.\n\nThe \"Sons of Jacob\" that founded Gilead were essentially a junta of heterosexual men (and their wives) and women who wanted to seize power for themselves in a totalitarian regime, using warped trappings of Christianity as propaganda and basis for a system of government. Some of their most entrenched enemies, however, are other mainstream Christian denominations (e.g. Roman Catholics, Protestants, Eastern Orthodoxy etc) whom the Sons of Jacob/Republic of Gilead view as evil and \"traitors\". Catholics abhor them for forcibly conscripting nuns to be sexually enslaved as Handmaids, and the novel makes sporadic mention that Gilead's military is fighting a protracted insurgency by Baptist groups across the American South. In her new author's foreword to the 2017 editions of the novel, Margaret Atwood compared this to how the Bolsheviks eradicated the more moderate Mensheviks during the Russian Revolution.\n\nGilead's leaders are largely just using women and minority groups as scapegoats because they can be easily discriminated against. They are also engaged in mass deportation of Jews from America to Israel, cramming them into cargo ships \u2013 though in practice, many transport ships simply cut corners by dumping their holds once they reach the open sea, leaving them to drown by the hundreds. In the novel, Gilead also discriminates against African-Americans, whom they refer to in their religious rhetoric as the \"Children of Ham\" (although this prejudice is absent in the television series).\n\nWhilst some of Gilead's leaders and founders are implied to truly believe in the regime, it is hinted that many of them are hypocrites who use Gilead as a means to gain power for themselves. They do not care for its values and ideals at all, and regularly flout its rules whilst punishing others who do so.\n\nHistory Edit\n\nThe early Gilead period Edit\n\nThe historical source known as The Handmaid's Tale is described as coming from the \"Early Gilead Period.\"\n\nLater Gilead Edit\n\nIt appears that Gilead existed on a scale of decades and not centuries. Several characters who were alive during the timeframe of The Handmaid's Tale are described as dying during purges which occurred in the \"Middle Gilead Period.\" This implies that there was also a \"Late Gilead Period.\" Gilead eventually fell from power, and is now studied in universities and schools in North America, where it is heavily implied that a new, secular, democratic government has been restored to power in the United States, with the harsh laws and regulations imposed by Gilead being overturned.\n\nMap Edit\n\nAs shown in the map in the season two finale, it can be implied that the zones highlighted in blue are territories controlled exclusively by the Republic of Gilead. This falls in line with the limited details in the novel and the fact that most of the action in the novel took place on the East Coast and because Washington, D.C. was the first to \"fall\" given the attacks on Congress, the White House, and the Supreme Court.\n\nThe states that make up the Republic of Gilead in complete occupation are: Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Delaware, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts.\n\nThe zones highlighted in yellow could mean that this entire region in the West and Midwest have been destroyed as a result of the civil war following the takeover. This is due to the fact that there are four radioactive symbols, in which the Colonies are located--the locations of the colonies are Arizona, California, and Missouri. A map prop from the show's production shows an additional two Colonies located in California in what was the San Francisco region and the Greater Los Angeles/Orange County/San Diego regions. Reader theories placed the Colonies in Florida and/or Michigan.\n\nZones in the dark red, located in both the West, Midwest, and South, could be sites of active war between rebels of the former United States of America and Guardians of the Faithful--the army of the Republic of Gilead. It can be assumed that the zones highlighted in a lighter shade of red are areas where the war may be light and Gilead is nearing a successful takeover (or the territory is still being contested by American military forces/rebels/citizen militias and Gilead forces via guerrilla warfare/insurgency). In addition to the mentioned rebel areas, there is a large American rebel stronghold located in New England with this stronghold centered in Vermont and parts of New Hampshire, Maine, and New York state.\n\nThe number of states in which the former United States of America was divided into has also been reduced in favor of larger states and wider boundaries.\n\nInspiration Edit\n\nAs Margaret Atwood has explained in various interviews, the \"Sons of Jacob\" and the \"Republic of Gilead\" they created, cynically don't actually believe in their own religious propaganda \u2013 almost every member of Gilead in a position of power, such as the Commanders, is at various points breaking their own rules, or expressing that they are simply using this as rhetoric. Atwood didn't conceive of Gilead as a Christian totalitarian regime, but a totalitarian fascist regime rising in the United States which happens to use some empty trappings of religion to justify itself.\n\nAtwood looked at the rise of various totalitarian fascist regimes throughout history and concluded that it always rises around some central trappings of national identity, and that in her estimation, the national character of the United States has always been shaped by religious movements. Similarly, Nazi Germany used trappings of past rhetoric about prior Germanic empires such as Charlemagne's Carolingian Empire and the pre-World War I German Empire or latched onto pre-existing European discrimination policies against disempowered groups (Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, left-wing/far-left Social Democrats and Communists, anti-Nazi Germans etc.) \u2013 but fundamentally, this was just a convenient scapegoat for what was at heart a hyper-nationalist junta that wanted to seize power for itself. Atwood tried to imagine what a totalitarian regime would look like if it took over the United States, and as the saying goes, \"When fascism comes to America, it will come carrying a cross and draped in the Stars and Stripes.\"\n\nAtwood also said that Gilead was partially inspired by the Religious Right's reaction in the 1980s to the Women's Rights movements of the 1970s, during the Reagan years. Particularly, Atwood was reacting to large-scale but baseless propaganda being circulated by hard right-wing religious groups that abortion and contraception access was leading to a \"white genocide,\" and that the birthrate among White Americans was sharply declining - despite the fact that there was no evidence to support this, and that census data proved it to be blatantly incorrect.\n\nAtwood's vision of Gilead also draws inspiration from the \"utopian idealism\" present from 20th-century communist regimes such as Pol Pot's Kampuchea (aka Cambodia) and Nicolae Ceausescu's Romania as well as earlier New England Puritanism.\n\nGallery Edit"}

{"label": true, "txt": "With new Bachelorette Becca Kufrin waiting in the wings to find her true love, former Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay is out of the spotlight \u2014 that\u2019s probably just how she wants it. She chose Miami-based doctor Bryan Abasolo at the end of her season, and the two walked into the sunset together during the 2017 finale. But, as we know, relationships founded on The Bachelor and The Bachelorette can have, let\u2019s say, short shelf lives. Bachelorette stars Rachel and Bryan still together in 2018?\n\nRachel took to television in 2017 with the dream of finding a man. And she found two! It came down to Bryan and Wisconsin-based personal trainer Peter Kraus. The finale was tough to watch, as Peter and Rachel seemed like a better match to many fans but Peter wasn\u2019t convinced that he could be engaged after knowing someone for, like, six weeks (imagine that). That didn\u2019t fly with Rachel, and the two had a really emotional breakup, one that Rachel thinks overshadowed the fact that she found longtime love with Bryan.\n\n\u201cI wish you were able to really see more of Bryan. [The breakup with Peter] really did overshadow, I felt, a happy moment for us, like one of the best moments of my life,\u201d Rachel told Us Weekly. \u201cI\u2019ve never been engaged before and neither has Bryan, and I felt like we were more on the defense about our relationship and having to explain more of it than rather it just showing \u2026 So I just wish you really got to see Bryan, and I hate that it took away from him.\u201d\n\nAnd, for the record, Peter and Rachel do not talk. \u201cFor me, the reason there was so much emotion [in the finale] was because that was closure for me, that was it,\u201d Rachel told Us Weekly. \u201cAnd I really haven\u2019t talked to him because I don\u2019t have anything else to say. From what I hear, he\u2019s doing well too.\u201d\n\nPeter is doing well, and you know what? Rachel and Bryan are, too! The pair is still together, living in Dallas (Bryan relocated from Miami) and being just a regular, everyday Bachelor Nation couple. (They also still have Copper, Rachel\u2019s dog, which is very important.)\n\nThe number-one question that a Bachelor couple gets after getting engaged on national television is, \u201cWhen are you getting married?\u201d At least Rachel and Bryan have an answer. As Bryan told ExtraTV, \u201cWe haven\u2019t set anything yet. We definitely want to get married this year, and that\u2019s the plan. 2018, it\u2019s gonna happen.\u201d He explained that even though Rachel \u201cisn\u2019t much of a planner,\u201d the nuptials would happen soon, and they may even be on television. \u201cWe would definitely be open to a televised wedding. We, right now, we enjoy showing everybody how in love we are... and I think that would be the culmination of our love story, or the beginning of it,\u201d Bryan said. \u201cI think we would definitely enjoy doing it on national television.\u201d\n\nI would also enjoy have a huge wedding paid for by ABC, so why not? In another interview with Us Weekly, Rachel said she needed a few things of the pair\u2019s impending nuptials. \u201cGood music. I\u2019m very big on \u2018I want everyone to have a good time and enjoy themselves.\u2019 I know it\u2019s like our day, but it\u2019s about the people we love celebrating our day with us,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I really want good flowers. I feel like flowers add character to the wedding, so that\u2019s a must-have. No roses. We\u2019re done. Those days are over.\u201d\n\nNo roses is probably a good idea \u2014 she could go into muscle memory and just start handing them out. No matter if you were #TeamBryan or #TeamPeter going into Rachel\u2019s finale, there\u2019s no doubt \u2014 she and Bryan are still in love, and they don\u2019t care who knows it."}

{"label": true, "txt": "Beyonc\u00e9 fans are getting their raincheck. This year\u2019s annual Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, which takes place near Indio, California, spans two weekends, April 13-15 and April 20-22, 2018. And Beyonc\u00e9, who had to cancel her planned 2017 performance (pregnancies and festivals seem like a bad mix), is on track to headline the 2018 festival\u2014along with stars like The Weeknd, Cardi B, and Eminem.\n\nSo how much will it cost to go to Coachella? The 2018 ticket prices range from $429 for general admission to almost $1,000 for VIP passes. They\u2019re all sold out, so you\u2019ll have to search Stubhub. (Good luck!)\n\nBut getting the tickets is only half the battle. You\u2019ll also need to arrange Coachella hotels or camping, shuttle passes or other transportation, food, and alcohol. To help you plan your ideal Coachella 2018 experience, MONEY scouted the options and priced out what it really costs to attend this festival.\n\nPorter Robinson & Madeon perform on the Coachella Stage during day 3 of the 2017 Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival (Weekend 2) at the Empire Polo Club on April 23, 2017 in Indio, California. Christopher Polk\u2014Getty Images for Coachella\n\nWhat Coachella Will Cost\n\nHere\u2019s what Coachella would cost you if you a) are a typical traveler and b) decide to go today. More details on the various pricing items below.\n\n$231: Plane ticket to LAX (This is an average price\u2014if you\u2019re coming from Maine, say, be prepared to drop some cash.)\n\n$575: General admission, via Stubhub. (Next year, grab tickets through the online sale.)\n\n$1,221: Three-night stay at a mid-range hotel (At $407 a night, you may want to consider camping.)\n\n$70: Shuttle from LAX to Coachella (Spend over three hours getting to know your fellow festival goers.)\n\n$75: Any Line, Anytime Shuttle pass (You\u2019ll need to get around, and Ubers will get too expensive.)\n\n$100: Food and water (Splurge a bit on top-notch vendors.)\n\n$75: Alcohol (Plan for a mix of BYOB at your hotel and a few beers from the Heineken House.)\n\nTotal: $2,347\n\nMusic fan Tallulah Willis of San Francisco, attends day 2 of the 2014 Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival at the Empire Polo Club. Christopher Polk\u2014Getty Images for Coachella\n\nCoachella Tickets\n\nWith this year\u2019s lineup, it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that passes are completely sold out. (Hello, it\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9.) That even includes the $999 VIP experience passes, which include access to special VIP lounges and seating areas, such as the Rose Garden (which has restrooms), as well as specialty food & beverage vendors.\n\nIf you got general admission tickets in presale or through the online process, congrats! You only spent $429. Otherwise, expect to spend a little more: Tickets on Stubhub are going for around $575 for weekend 1 and $399 for weekend 2.\n\nDemand is up 24% for Coachella\u2019s first weekend, according to StubHub sales data, but you can still get passes for a decent price, relative to face value. That\u2019s particularly true for the festival\u2019s second weekend. \u201cWeekend 2 passes are also generally less expensive and have fewer crowds, so this is a great time to see the same lineup of artists at a reduced cost,\u201d says StubHub spokeswoman Jessica Erskine.\n\nA group of festivalgoers chill out at an onsite campground at the 2011 Coachella Music & Arts Festival in Indio. Luis Sinco\u2014LA Times via Getty Images\n\nCoachella Hotels and Camping\n\nThe cheapest lodging options for Coachella are generally car or tent camping on-site. Passes start at $113 for the weekend, but you should hurry; tent camping passes for the second weekend are already sold out.\n\nPrefer one of Coachella\u2019s hotel options? A 3-star hotel room nearby is going for $407 per night during the festival weekends, according to travel site Hipmunk. Even a 2-star experience will cost you $312, on average, Hipmunk reports. That\u2019s about 116% higher than the average prices in the area. Five-star hotels for Coachella are a painful $1,500 a night, up 147% from the average rate of roughly $600.\n\nFor those looking to splurge (YOLO, right?), Valley Music Travel has glamping options that take it to a whole new level. On-site safari tents are available for the weekend starting at $8,500 for two people (each additional person is $2,000), which also includes the price of two VIP passes to the festival. At this point, it may not be a bad bet.\n\nCoachella offered the option to stay in a teepee at nearby Lake Eldorado for only $2,458. The package includes two general admission tickets, plus lodging for the weekend in a teepee with two cots, two sleeping bags, and two pillows. This may be best as a plan for next year, though: 2018 Lake Eldorado packages are sold out.\n\nAnd sadly the Resort at Coachella experience (around $25,000 for the weekend), complete with a stay in a luxury yurt and passes, is also sold out. You snooze, you lose.\n\nA vivid sunset over Palm Springs International Airport late in the day as a United Airlines jet passes, May 6, 2016. 400tmax\u2014Getty Images\n\nCoachella Shuttle, Flights, and Other Transportation\n\nFlying to Coachella isn\u2019t too pricey\u2014the average airfare into LAX for the weekend is about $230 round-trip, according to travel app Hopper. Flights into the closer Palm Springs airport are just a few bucks more.\n\nBut then you need to consider how you\u2019re going to get around once you\u2019re there\u2014and this is where your budget could really fall apart. A rental car from LAX will set you back about $66 per day, according to Hipmunk. You\u2019re paying a premium\u2014rental car prices for Coachella weekends were up over 60% from the usual $41 rate, the booking site found.\n\nIn the end, it may be more effective to simply go with shuttle bus tickets. The Coachella shuttle from LAX will set you back $70, while a shuttle pass for the weekend\u2014which gets you back and forth from the festival grounds to local hotels and camping areas\u2014is around $75 per person.\n\nUber, of course, will also be operating at the festival\u2014but we don\u2019t recommend it. Not only is the pickup point is much farther than the shuttle pickup, but it\u2019s hella pricey.\n\nCraft beer tent seen during day 1 of the 2016 Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival Weekend 1 at the Empire Polo Club. Matt Cowan\u2014Getty Images for Coachella\n\nCoachella Food and Alcohol Prices\n\nTo save the most on food and water, you can load up the car with shelf-stable groceries for the weekend and carry around a collapsible water bottle. But let\u2019s be honest: Part of the Coachella experience is about the food vendors and bars.\n\nFor drinks, expect to shell out about $10 a beer if you\u2019re visiting the Craft Beer Barn and $8 for drinks at the Heineken Experience.\n\nCoachella also offers some fine dining options. Outstanding in the Field is a $225, four-course dinner experience prepared by celebrity chefs like Santa Monica-based chef Bruce Kalman and Tyler Anderson, chef and owner of Millwright\u2019s Restaurant and Tavern.\n\nAnd in case you\u2019re wondering: Even though weed is now legal in California, the company producing Coachella, Goldenvoice, doesn\u2019t appear to be taking any chances. After all, as far as the U.S. government is concerned, smoking a joint is still an illegal activity\u2014even on festival grounds. But as one Reddit thread puts it: \u201cAs long as you\u2019re not an idiot you should be able to get it in pretty easily.\u201d So perhaps it\u2019s worth budgeting in that expense as well."}
{"label": true, "txt": "When I arrive to meet Skeet Ulrich at his home in Studio City, Los Angeles, I\u2019m greeted by his well-mannered 16-year-old son, Jakob, who escorts me into the house through the garage. \u201cI built this,\u201d he says, pointing to a motorcycle. I\u2019m impressed, and had I not just walked 850 feet uphill in a sweatshirt, I might have managed more than a \u201cwow, that\u2019s awesome!\u201d But I\u2019m winded and red-faced, and can\u2019t believe I have to meet his dad, a god of the late nineties, looking like a tomato.\n\nThese days, Ulrich, 47, is known as Jughead\u2019s jailbird father, FP Jones, on The CW murder-mystery Riverdale, but his career has spanned more than two decades, popping off in 1996 with roles in The Craft, in which he played a high-school creep put under a love spell, and Scream, in which he played a serial killer who somehow made fake blood look finger-licking good. (\u201cCorn syrup,\u201d the line goes. \u201cSame stuff they used for pig\u2019s blood in Carrie.\u201d) Leave it to a shrink to unpack the how and why of Billy Loomis\u2019s sex appeal (I\u2019d say it\u2019s the greasy hair) \u2014 Ulrich was just trying to act.\n\nScream. Miramax\n\n\u201cThis was when you received hard fan mail, and there would be trash bags full of letters, so I was aware that I had a popularity,\u201d he tells me from his couch, where his dog Lua, who is smaller than my forearm, flops around like a Beanie Baby come to life. \u201cAs to where I sat on the heartthrob scale, I had no [idea]. There was no real barometer. You go on Instagram now and, yeah, we all know Cole [Sprouse, who plays Jughead] is a heartthrob. It\u2019s very obvious.\u201d If only Skeet Ulrich saw the inside of my middle-school notebooks.\n\nUlrich was married to actress Georgina Cates by the age of 27 and moved to a farm in Virginia not long after. (He and Cates have twins, Jakob and Naiia, born in 2001; the couple divorced in 2005.) He rarely walked red carpets because he hates getting his picture taken. \u201cI never look how I thought I\u2019d look,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m like, I think I look pretty good tonight. And then I see the picture and I\u2019m like, Oh, I was very wrong.\u201d He was the only star of Scream absent from the stage at the MTV Movie Awards when the Wes Craven horror film took home Best Movie (it was up against Romeo + Juliet). The fame was \u201cnot something I was interested in,\u201d he says. \u201cI was really interested in doing things that challenged me.\u201d\n\nThe Newton Boys. 20th Century Fox via Getty Images\n\nHe took roles in James L. Brooks\u2019s As Good as It Gets (1997), Richard Linklater\u2019s The Newton Boys (1998), and Ang Lee\u2019s Ride With the Devil (1999), and says he passed on movies like Armageddon (the role went to Ben Affleck) and Face/Off (the role went to Alessandro Nivola). It's as if he was borrowing from Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s Guide to Rejecting Leomania: no matter how hot teens think you are, do not make movies they'll care about.\n\n\u201cI see Leo around quite a bit,\u201d Ulrich says. \u201cHe\u2019s always very nice. He\u2019ll stop conversations he\u2019s having to come say hi to me, so whatever bond we formed 20 years ago, it still has relevance to both of us.\u201d The guys hung out back in the day, after DiCaprio\u2019s friend, magician David Blaine, came to live with Ulrich for about six months. But when I inquire about the infamous Pussy Posse, DiCaprio\u2019s clique of womanizing party boys whose members included Lukas Haas, Tobey Maguire (with whom Urlich starred in Ride With the Devil), and Blaine, Ulrich looks puzzled. \u201cI don\u2019t even know what that is.\u201d\n\nAs thrilling as it is to recount the glory days of the nineties, at least for me (Ulrich seems more animated when talking about how much he hates Trump \u2014 \"he's got to be impeached before he destroys the world\" \u2014 or how much he loves Darren Aronofsky\u2019s Mother! than he does his past), there\u2019s a more serious matter to discuss. Nine days prior to our meeting, the New York Times published an article alleging that producer Harvey Weinstein, whose long list of movies includes Scream, had been sexually harassing women for decades, reportedly trying to coerce actresses to watch him shower, among other horrors. The New Yorker followed the story with its own chilling report that included allegations of sexual assault, the Times ran additional harassment accounts from Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow, and there have been other accusations since. (Weinstein has denied many of the allegations, including \"any allegations of non-consensual sex,\" according to The New Yorker.)\n\n\n\n\u201cI knew,\u201d Ulrich admits. \u201cMost people knew. I had dinner with someone who is one of the most famous women on the planet \u2014 I won\u2019t say who it is \u2014 who has not come out, who told me similar things.\u201d\n\nHe didn\u2019t do anything about it, he says, because \u201cthere is nothing you can do. I mean, What am I gonna do? I can\u2019t step up, certainly then, on allegations. Honestly, and I think it\u2019s what most people faced: How do you cut your livelihood from a very powerful corporation on something that you don\u2019t know what the facts are? Now that it\u2019s starting to come out and people are finally stepping up and saying stuff, I\u2019m glad. That\u2019s what it takes. Because one person stepping up and making allegations is gonna hurt that one person and not help anyone, especially [against] someone with that power.\u201d\n\nAmong the most outspoken of Weinstein\u2019s accusers is Ulrich\u2019s Scream co-star Rose McGowan, who claimed on Twitter that Weinstein raped her (Weinstein denies the allegation). The Times had previously reported that Weinstein paid her a financial settlement of $100,000 in 1997 for an unspecified \u201cepisode.\u201d\n\nThere is nothing you can do. I mean, What am I gonna do? I can\u2019t step up, certainly then, on allegations.\n\n\u201cI saw her about a year ago and that was the only time I\u2019d seen her since like \u201999 or something,\u201d Ulrich says. \u201cNone of this [news] was out at that time, so it certainly wasn\u2019t anything I was going to bring up with her. It wasn\u2019t even in my thought process.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat industry is safe?\u201d he adds. \u201cWhere is a beautiful woman, or any woman, free to walk down the street and not be a feast to some asshole\u2019s eyes? I see how men can be. And then you give a man power? It\u2019s scary.\u201d\n\nUlrich has a stillness about him throughout our conversation. He\u2019s even-keeled, restrained, and says \u201cbless you\u201d every time his publicist, who\u2019s sitting at the dining-room table, sneezes. My interest in him was renewed not only because of his role in Riverdale, but because of his touchy-feely social media activity. He leaves breathlessly supportive comments on his children\u2019s Instagram posts \u2014 \u201cLove this shot!!!\u201d \u201cSo cool!!!\u201d \u201cYou are ALWAYS a ray of sunshine.\u201d Despite not knowing him personally, Busy Philipps once shouted him out in an Instagram story, praising him for putting his acting career on hold to raise his kids. Ulrich says he didn\u2019t watch the story, but someone told him about it. \u201c[She said] I left the business or something?\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d he clarifies. \u201cI left a great deal of opportunities because I couldn\u2019t work outside of L.A. with [my kids] being little.\u201d The limitations were \u201cfrustrating,\u201d he admits, declining to comment on the twins' mother. \u201cI had such a nonexistent father, I knew that if I did have kids I would never allow them to feel unwanted.\" The result is a tight-knit family that\u2019s expanded to include his fianc\u00e9e, Brazilian model Rose Costa, and her son, Luca (his father is James Marsden), who will be 5 in December.\n\nThe Craft. United Archives GmbH / Alamy Stock Photo\n\nUlrich was born Bryan Ray Trout in Lynchburg, Virginia, but spent most of his childhood in North Carolina; he took his last name from his first stepfather and got the nickname \u201cSkeet\u201d from a coach who noticed the boy\u2019s small build. (He had open-heart surgery when he was 10 and frequently fell ill with pneumonia.) It wasn\u2019t until Ulrich transferred to New York University from the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, where he was studying marine biology, that he began acting in earnest, starting out in theater under the tutelage of playwright David Mamet, then moving into film. \u201cMy god, most of my beginning films, like Boys, the first one, I was horrific,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I thought I was really bad in The Craft. I was like, This is horrible.\u201d (He doesn\u2019t know anything about the possible quasi remake, but says he \"got paid a usage fee for some clip that they\u2019re using in it, from the original. Whether that\u2019s still in there or not, I don\u2019t know.\u201d)\n\nEarly in his career, Ulrich was relentlessly compared to Johnny Depp. \u201cAll the time,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s certainly worse people to be compared to \u2026 I always thought he was a very good-looking guy.\u201d But the talent digs stung. \u201cIt hurt when people compared our acting and [said] I\u2019m not half the actor he is,\u201d Ulrich says. \u201cAnd yet I think I\u2019ve done some stuff he couldn\u2019t do. He also did \u2014 what was it called, [with] Angelina Jolie? The Tourist. So we all have \u2018em.\u201d\n\nJericho. Getty\n\nUlrich allows that his own IMDB profile began to \u201cwaiver\u201d by the early 2000s. \u201cI stockpiled some money on a couple of movies I shouldn\u2019t have been a part of,\u201d he says. On top of that, \u201cI\u2019m sure [my distance from the scene] hurt me in the long run \u2014 when you\u2019re not in producers\u2019 faces, when you\u2019re not at the parties and all that stuff, it took its toll, for sure. But I wouldn\u2019t trade it.\u201d\n\nHe made his shift to TV in 2003 with ABC\u2019s Miracles, which got canceled after six episodes. Then there was CBS's Jericho (2006), which got pulled after one season, brought back by popular demand, and shut down again; a 2010-11 stint on Law & Order: L.A. (he got killed off); and a string of pilots that never saw the light of day. If you take all that work into consideration, Riverdale isn\u2019t Ulrich\u2019s comeback \u2014 he never went anywhere. But the CW show is his first project in quite some time that \u201chas a bubbling about it,\u201d he concedes. \u201cIt\u2019s the only set I\u2019ve been on in my 20-something years doing this where you have to wade through a couple hundred people to get on the set.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also the first time Ulrich\u2019s played a dad (not counting the series that were dead on arrival). When I point out the irony of such a good dad playing such a bad dad, he disagrees. \u201cI think he\u2019s a great dad without means. To me, the summation of FP Jones is \u2018sometimes good people do bad things for the right reasons.\u2019 What I love about him is he\u2019s clearly the most blue-collar of anyone on that show. He\u2019s the working class, he\u2019s the coal miner, the construction worker. He\u2019s the guy who\u2019s shit upon day in and day out by society, and that was evident through the first season.\u201d\n\nRiverdale. The CW\n\nNext up are a small part in Ryan Murphy\u2019s Versace: American Crime Story and a role in Lifetime\u2019s I Am Elizabeth Smart movie, narrated by Smart, in which he\u2019ll play Brian David Mitchell, the man who kidnapped her at knifepoint from her home in 2002. \u201cIt was stressful for both of us,\u201d he says of his first meeting with Smart. \u201cI think the producers\u2019 intention was [that] we would meet before I went into the hair and makeup chair, and it didn\u2019t happen and nobody was there to sort of foster us along. She walked in and you could feel her breath just stop.\u201d\n\nBefore I leave, we take a field trip to the family\u2019s chicken coop, which Ulrich constructed with help from Riverdale co-stars KJ Apa (who plays Archie) and Sprouse. \u201cI think everybody looks for distractions outside of the work and the business and the press,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd I had it readily available here and they jumped right in.\u201d Ulrich also builds furniture, including a coffee table he made out of teak and birch plywood, the dining-room table, kitchen cabinets, and a console.\n\nRiker Brothers\n\nWe walk down the driveway and back up along a narrow path \u2014 me, Ulrich, his publicist, Jakob, and Luca. (Naiia and Rose are out this morning.) \u201cDad, you know I saw two deers before?\u201d Luca says on our way to meet Clucky, Marilou, Heihei (a nod to Moana), and Coco. \u201cI know,\u201d Ulrich says encouragingly. \u201cRight there?\u201d \u201cRight behind our chicken coop!\u201d He also saw hawks and a bald eagle. Jakob retrieves five eggs from the coop and picks up Heihei so I can pet her.\n\nEarlier, I\u2019d asked Ulrich if his kids are embarrassed by his public displays of fatherhood. \u201cNever. Not at all,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re great human beings.\u201d Jakob likes racing (Ulrich\u2019s family has NASCAR roots). \"If he doesn\u2019t know how to do something, he\u2019s like me: he researches until he understands it, and then does it.\u201d And Naiia wants to be an actress. \u201cI refuse to let her just jump into the business part without proper training, because if you want a career at it, you need to know what you\u2019re doing, and so we\u2019re trying to find the right things for her to study and where.\u201d\n\nUlrich bends to show Luca some Swiss chard. It\u2019s in the midst of a garden that\u2019s looking otherwise rough, given that he\u2019s not had much time to tend to it. It\u2019s not as if he\u2019s gone for stretches of time or anything; he typically shoots Riverdale in Vancouver two days a week. But the hours he does have with his family are precious and sometimes, that means the leafy greens have to wait. \u201cWe don\u2019t have any rule [for how long I can be gone],\u201d he says. But if he had it his way? \u201cI\u2019d say a day. Because home \u2026 it\u2019s heaven to me what we have here.\u201d\n\nFollow Cosmo Celeb on Facebook.\n\n"}

{"label": true, "txt": "Serena Williams Biography\n\nSerena Jameka Williams (born September 26, 1981) is an American professional tennis player who is currently ranked No. 1 in women's singles tennis. The Women's Tennis Association has ranked her World No. 1 in singles on six separate occasions. She became the World No. 1 for the first time on July 8, 2002, and regained this ranking for the sixth time on February 18, 2013, becoming the oldest world no. 1 player in WTA's history. Williams is also widely regarded to be one of the greatest female tennis players in history. She is the only female player to have won over $50 million in prize money Williams is the reigning French Open, US Open, WTA Tour Championships and Olympic ladies singles champion.\n\nEarly life\n\n\n\nSerena Williams was born in Saginaw, Michigan, to Richard Williams and Oracene Price and is the youngest of Price's five daughters: half-sisters Yetunde, Lyndrea and Isha Price, and full sister Venus. When the children were young, the family moved to Compton, California, where Serena started playing tennis at the age of four. Her father home-schooled Serena and her sister Venus and to this day, Serena Williams was and remains coached by both her parents. Williams's family moved from Compton to West Palm Beach when she was nine so that she could attend the tennis academy of Rick Macci, who would provide additional coaching. Macci spotted the exceptional talents of the sisters. He did not always agree with Williams's father, but respected that \"he treated his daughters like kids, allowed them to be little girls\". Richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments when Williams was 10, since he wanted them to take it slow and focus on school work. Another factor was racial, as he had heard white parents talk about the Williams sisters in a derogatory manner during tournaments.\n\n\n\nPlaying style\n\n\n\nWilliams is primarily a baseline player and her game is built around taking immediate control of rallies with her powerful and consistent serve, return of serve, and forceful groundstrokes from both her forehand and backhand swings. Williams's forehand is considered to be among the most powerful shots in the women's game as is her double-handed backhand. Williams strikes her backhand groundstroke using an open stance, and uses the same open stance for her forehand. Williams's aggressive play, a \"high risk\" style, is balanced in part by her serve, which combines great power and placement with very high consistency. Her serve is considered to be the greatest in women's tennis history. In the 2013 Australian Open, she had a peak serve speed of 128.6 mph (207.0 km/h) which is the third-fastest all-time among female players (only Venus's 129 mph and Sabine Lisicki's 131 mph recorded speeds are faster). At the 2012 Wimbledon Championships, Serena hit a women's tournament record of 102 aces which was more than any of the men hit during the two weeks. Serena also possesses a very solid volley and powerful overhead which is very useful for her net game. Although many think of Williams as only an offensive player, she also plays a strong defensive game.\n\n\n\nProfessional career\n\n\n\nWilliams's first professional event was in September 1995, at the age of 14 to counteract the forthcoming changes to age-eligibility rules, at the Bell Challenge. She lost in the first round of qualifying to Anne Miller, winning just two games.\n\n\n\nOff-court activities\n\nFashion\n\n\n\nWilliams was once known for her unusual and colorful outfits on court. In 2002, there was much talk when she wore a Lane Bryant black lycra catsuit at the US Open. At the 2004 US Open, Williams wore denim skirts and knee-high boots\u2014tournament officials, however, did not allow her to wear the boots during matches.At Wimbledon in 2008, the white trench coat she wore during warm-up for her opening match was the subject of much discussion since it was worn despite the sunny weather. Off-court, Williams has also presented new designs. In November 2004, at the London premiere of After the Sunset she wore a red gown that had a near-topless effect.\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nWilliams has appeared on television and also provided voice work on animated shows: in a 2001 episode of The Simpsons Serena joined the animation along with sister Venus, Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi. She has also provided guest voice work in a 2005 episode of Playhouse Disney's animated kids show Higglytown Heroes and a 2007 episode of the Nickelodeon cartoon Avatar: The Last Airbender, which she has described as her \"favorite show\"\n\n\n\nCharity work\n\n\n\nIn 2008 Williams helped to fund the construction of the Serena Williams Secondary School in Matooni, Kenya. She received a Celebrity Role Model Award from Avon Foundation in 2003 for work in breast cancer.

Network executives say it\u2019s the channel\u2019s most-watched premiere in two years.\n\nA solid number for the show isn\u2019t surprising \u2014 Scientology is one of those topics that\u2019s irresistible, mostly because of the secretive nature of the famously controversial church. Remini, known for the hit sitcom \u201cKing of Queens,\u201d was a devout Scientologist for 35 years before she left the church in 2013. She has been an outspoken critic ever since, although it is extremely rare for anyone to criticize Scientology after they leave. Here\u2019s her history of calling out the church:\n\n[How Leah Remini is trying to expose Scientology secrets in her new docuseries]\n\n(For the record, the church has called Remini an \u201cobnoxious, spiteful ex-Scientologist\u201d and claims the actress is bitter that she was expelled for unethical conduct; it also disputes many statements made in the A&E show. Church officials say that Remini is trying to \u201cdistort the truth\u201d about Scientology and that she\u2019s \u201cdoing [the show] for the money and now tries to pretend otherwise.\u201d)\n\nLeah Remini, the actress best known for hit CBS sitcom \"King of Queens,\" produced a documentary series about the Church of Scientology. (A&E)\n\nJuly 2013: Page Six confirms that Remini, who rose to very high levels in the organization once she became a star and donated millions, has left Scientology. A Remini \u201csource\u201d says the actress was \u201cput through interrogations and blacklisted within the church\u201d when she started to question leader David Miscavige, particularly the whereabouts of his wife, Shelly, who reportedly hasn\u2019t been seen in public since 2007.\n\nRemini said she also disagreed with the church\u2019s policies that restrict members from talking to relatives who criticize the church, a practice known as \u201cdisconnecting.\u201d \u201cShe is stepping back from a regime she thinks is corrupt. She thinks no religion should tear apart a family or abuse someone under the umbrella of \u2018religion,\u2019 \u201d the source says.\n\nLater that month, Remini echoes this sentiment to People magazine. \u201cI believe that people should be able to question things. I believe that people should value family, and value friendships, and hold those things sacrosanct,\u201d she says. \u201cThat for me, that\u2019s what I\u2019m about. It wouldn\u2019t matter what it was, simply because no one is going to tell me how I need to think, no one is going to tell me who I can, and cannot, talk to.\u201d\n\nAugust 2013: Remini files a missing-person report for Shelly Miscavige, which the Los Angeles Police Department calls \u201cunfounded.\u201d The church says it\u2019s \u201cill-advised, ludicrous self-promotion\u201d on Remini\u2019s part.\n\nSeptember 2013: Remini joins the cast of \u201cDancing With the Stars,\u201d where she lands in fifth place. During one episode, she tells her partner, Tony Dovolani, that she hoped the show would help her move on. \u201cThe church is looking for me to fail so they can say to their parishioners, \u2018You see what happens when you leave the church?\u2019 They\u2019re waiting for me to fail,\u201d Remini says.\n\nFebruary 2014: Remini tells Buzzfeed that she quit Scientology because her young daughter was getting closer to the age of getting \u201cacclimated\u201d in it and would have to sit for audits, where members divulge personal information. Plus, Remini thought Scientology was taking over her life. \u201cI was spending most of my time at the Church,\u201d she says. \u201cSo, I was saying \u2018family first,\u2019 but I wasn\u2019t showing that. I didn\u2019t like the message that sent my daughter.\u201d (Scientology officials call Remini\u2019s statements \u201cabsurd, insulting and motivated entirely by a desire to grab attention.\u201d)\n\nScientology's famous members and secretive beliefs endlessly intrigue popular culture.

Remini tweets her praise: \u201cThank you to the brave who did something about it. And to those who didn\u2019t have a voice, you do now.\u201d\n\nMay 2015: Remini sits for an interview with Oprah Winfrey in \u201cOprah: Where Are They Now?\u201d and talks about how painful it was to leave friends behind in the church. \u201cI\u2019m learning there\u2019s a new world out here and there shouldn\u2019t be any kind of judgment toward somebody who has a belief system that is not yours,\u201d she says.\n\nJuly 2015: The second and final season of her TLC reality show, \u201cLeah Remini: It\u2019s All Relative,\u201d premieres, and Remini talks more about how she left to protect her daughter.\n\nOctober 2015: Remini writes a book, \u201cTroublemaker: Surviving Hollywood and Scientology,\u201d and promotes it with an in-depth interview on \u201c20/20,\u201d reiterating her previous claims and saying she didn\u2019t want want to be \u201cdisconnected\u201d from her daughter.\n\nNovember 2015: Remini\u2019s book is released, and she spills lots of dirt, including tales of Scientology superstar Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes\u2019s wedding weekend, which is where her relationship with the church started to go downhill after Remini was accused of behaving badly. The church\u2019s response? Remini is \u201cpathetically exploiting her former religion, her former friends and other celebrities for money and attention to appear relevant again.\u201d\n\nDecember 2015: According to her show on A&E, Remini starts to get lots of requests for help from people who still have family members in the church.

The MTV personality revealed in a Wednesday, August 16, interview with Radar Online that she doesn\u2019t want her ex-husband Javi Marroquin to have a relationship with her yet-to-be named newborn son whom she gave birth to on August 5. (The child\u2019s father is Chris Lopez.)\n\nCelebrity Babies of 2017\n\nThe 25-year-old, who is also mom to son Isaac, 7, (whom she shares with ex Jo Rivera), and son Lincoln, 3, (whom she shares with Marroquin) acknowledged that while Marroquin, 24, has played a father figure role in Isaac\u2019s life\u2014 she doesn\u2019t feel it\u2019s necessary for him to form a similar bond with the child she shares with Lopez.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a reason for him to be involved other than knowing and acknowledging that this is Lincoln\u2019s half sibling. That being said, on my end, there is no bad blood. But I don\u2019t think there is any reason for him to necessarily be involved,\u201d the mom shared with Radar.\n\nAnd while Lowry and Marroquin have had an up-and-down relationship since their May 2016 breakup, the mom of three confirmed he did reach out to her after she gave birth.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t ask how he was handling it,\u201d she explained to the outlet. \u201cBut he did say congratulations.\u201d\n\nMaking things more complicated, Marroquin, who previously told Radar he wouldn\u2019t have a relationship with the newborn, might have a legal responsibility to the child.\n\nAttorney Brooke A. Camhi, who is not licensed in Lowry\u2019s home state of Delaware, revealed to Radar: \u201cDelaware law states that the ex-husband is presumed the father of a child if the child is born less than 300 days after the divorce.\u201d\n\nIn order for Marroquin to free himself of responsibility, he would need to file a valid denial of paternity with the Office of Vital Statistics. According to Statue 8-305, Lopez will be required to file a valid acknowledgement of paternity to \u201cdischarge the presumed father from all rights and duties of a parent.\u201d\n\nThe pair divorced after nearly four years of marriage after Lowry revealed she did not want to have another child with Marroquin. He would go on to accuse the reality personality of cheating on him while he was deployed by the Air Force.\n\nBut the MTV star doesn\u2019t seemed too concerned about the legal logistics of her complicated paternity situation. \u201cJavi is not the father,\u201d she explained to Radar. \u201cChris is the father so I think we\u2019re all going to work together to make sure everything is taken care of and that that\u2019s established.\u201d\n\nFor the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly\u2019s YouTube Page.\n\nSign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter to get breaking celebrity news, hot pics and more delivered straight to your inbox!\n\nWant stories like these delivered straight to your phone?

{"label": true, "txt": "With both Jenner sisters eager to share their hair, makeup and skincare recommendation on every app and social platform imaginable, it's pretty much impossible to determine who gives better beauty advice. Kendall and Kylie Jenner look flawless all the time, so how are we supposed to know which one of them to listen to when it comes to our own beauty regimens? In an attempt figure it out, I took their tips for a test drive and tried Kendall and Kylie's skincare routines to see which reigned supreme. The result? Two weeks worth of the glowiest skin I've ever had.\n\nKendall and Kylie are both adamant about using eye cream and sunscreen every day (tricks they picked up from Kim and Khloe , respectively), but the similarities in their regimens pretty much stop there.\n\nKendall has been open about her struggles with acne (which makes me love her even more, TBH), and the majority of her skincare routine is made up of prescription products she gets from her dermatologist. She also uses skincare from The Est\u00e9e Edit , a line that she helped create, as well as Elta MD sunscreen .\n\nKylie, whose skin seems to be a bit less irritable than her sister's (at least as far as she's shared), is a bit more experimental with her products, although she tends toward those with all-natural ingredients. Considering how beauty-obsessed she is, it's no surprise that she likes to try out a bunch of different things. (She changes skincare products almost as frequently as she changes hairstyles.) She's touted the below products (AKA, the ones I tested) as some of her all-time favorites , and has also recently professed her love for Nip + Fab Dargon's Blood Fix Serum , Nip + Fab's Glycolic Fix Night Pads , Mario Badescu's Drying Lotion , and Kiehl's Daily Reviving Concentrate .\n\nLet me just say: every single one of the products I tested exceeded my expectations \u2014 which, in hindsight, makes sense considering the KarJenners have access to the best skincare in the world. Every product did exactly what they promised to do for my skin, and all smelled straight-up amazing while doing it. Because of this, picking a \"winner\" didn't really make sense, especially considering how different their skincare needs are not only from each another's, but also from my own.\n\nWith that in mind, here are my honest opinions on every product in I sampled in the Kendall vs. Kylie skincare challenge. If you're looking to try any of them, you really can't go wrong. And the best part? Not a single one of them costs more than $60. Apparently, keeping up with the Kardashians is more affordable than I thought \u2014 at least as far as skincare goes.\n\nCleanser\n\nKendall and Kylie:\n\nThe Verdict: This cleanser, which both Jenner ladies get from their dermatologist Christie Kidd , is just as amazing as they say it is. It goes on as a liquid instead of a cream, gel, or foam, which left my skin feeling clean, as was promised on the bottle. For now, the cleanser is only available in Christie's L.A. office, but is expected to become available online soon. Kendall also uses Kidd's Acne Fresh Pads and Renewal Serum to treat her acne, which were unavailable for me to test because they're prescription-only.\n\nEye Cream\n\nKendall:\n\nThe Est\u00e9e Edit Late Night Eraser Brightening Eye Balm with Pink Peony, $48, Sephora.com\n\nKylie:\n\nKiehl's Creamy Eye Treatment With Avocado, $29, Kiehls.com\n\nThe Verdict:\n\nConsidering how important eye cream is to the Kardashian/Jenner Clan, it's no surprise that both Kendall and Kylie have found spectacular products to get the job done. It was a tough call as to which I liked better, but for me, the Est\u00e9e Edit's eye balm reigned supreme simply because of its application method. I always forget to dab my eye cream on instead of rubbing it, which according to the internet is going to give me horrible bags under my eyes later in life. The Est\u00e9e Edit's balm goes on as a roller ball, which makes the whole rubbing vs. dabbing situation totally avoidable. It's great for brightening up under eye bags in the morning, doubles as a primer under your concealer, and can be reapplied throughout the day over your makeup for a quick fix. Kiehl's eye treatment goes on a bit thicker than the eye balm, and works really well at night when you can really let it soak into your skin. Full disclosure: I'll be adding both products to my daily routine from now on.\n\nMoisturizer\n\nKendall:\n\nThe Est\u00e9e Edit Rescue Balm For Face And Body, $58, Sephora.com\n\nKylie:\n\nMimosa Blossom Dream Cream, $6.95, SuperSalve.com\n\nThe Verdict: The best part about both of these moisturizers is the fact that they can be used on the face and the body, and who doesn't love a two-for-one product? Both products are hydrating and can be used in the morning, at night, and throughout the day. The Mimosa Blossom Dream Cream smells like a creamsicle, which would probably give it the win in any other contest, but the Est\u00e9e Edit Moisturizer is my favorite skincare product I've ever used (and trust me, I've tested more of them than I'd like to admit). My skin feels so soft after I put it on that I've started asking people (mostly friends, but some strangers) to touch my face throughout the day so they can understand just how amazing it is. That aside, the Dream Cream is small enough to fit in your makeup bag and a great option for hydrating typically dry body parts like hands, elbows and knees on the go, especially if you like spending your days smelling like a dessert.\n\nSUNSCREEN\n\nKendall:\n\nElta MD Broad Spectrum SPF 46, $20.42, Amazon.com\n\nKylie:\n\nTizO3 Facial Mineral Sunscreen, $37, Amazon.com\n\n__ The Verdict:__ It's a toss up: Both sunscreens come in tinted and untinted options, so can be worn under your foundation or in place of it. I tried, and liked, the tinted version of each. The TizO3 has the texture of a thick cream (... or a chocolate mousse cake) and offers pretty solid coverage, while the EltaMD is more like a liquid foundation and makes you skin look hydrated and dewy. The EltaMD technically has more protection (SPF 46 versus TizO3's SPF 40), but the difference in coverage between the two products is so small that it doesn't really matter. I liked the EltaMD because of the radiant glow it left behind, but ended up using it underneath my foundation because it didn't give me as much coverage as I normally like. Both products are highly effective, and as long as you're wearing sunscreen at all, it's a skincare win in my book.\n\nRelated: This Picture Perfectly Represents How Kendall and Kylie Jenner Do Beauty Differently"}

{"label": true, "txt": "\"Seeing her name in headlines again and again, as part of one person\u2019s attempt to gain more attention for her personal cause, along with Harvey\u2019s desperate attempt to vindicate himself, was devastating for her,\" the family said.\n\nVeteran studio executive and producer Jill Messick died by suicide on Wednesday after battling depression for many years, her family tells The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nMessick, who worked at Miramax as a production executive from 1997 to 2003, also served as Rose McGowan's manager in January 1997, which is when, McGowan has claimed, she was raped by Harvey Weinstein.\n\nIn a statement following her death, her family says Messick was \"victimized\" after becoming embroiled in the Weinstein-McGowan allegations. Her name made headlines when Weinstein's attorney, Ben Brafman, released an email on Jan. 30 attributed to Messick in defense of his client. Her family says now that Messick \"became collateral damage in an already horrific story.\"\n\nMessick's family's full Feb. 8 statement is below.\n\n\"The Movement\" just lost one of its own.\n\nJill Messick was a mother of two children, a loving wife and partner, a dear friend to many and a smart entertainment executive. She was also a survivor, privately battling depression, which had been her nemesis for years.\n\nToday she did not survive. Jill took her own life.\n\nJill was victimized by our new culture of unlimited information sharing and a willingness to accept statement as fact. The speed of disseminating information has carried mistruths about Jill as a person, which she was unable and unwilling to challenge. She became collateral damage in an already horrific story.\n\nJill believed in the Movement. She supported every woman finally coming forward to share their dark truths and expose those who had committed previously unspeakable deeds. She was loyal. She was strong. Jill was many things, but she was not a liar.\n\nOver the past few months, many women have come out with allegations against Harvey Weinstein, including Rose McGowan, who has repeatedly spoken with the press, striking out against not only her alleged attacker, but a great many others. One of them was Jill, who chose to remain silent in the face of Rose's slanderous statements against her for fear of undermining the many individuals who came forward in truth. She opted not to add to the feeding frenzy, allowing her name and her reputation to be sullied despite having done nothing wrong. She never chose to be a public figure; that choice was taken away from her.\n\nNow that Jill can no longer speak for herself, it's time to set the record straight.\n\nIn January 1997, Jill was an entry-level manager at Addis Wechsler. One of her first clients was Rose McGowan, and one of Jill's first duties was to set up a breakfast meeting with Harvey Weinstein during the Sundance Film Festival. Following the meeting, Rose told Jill what had happened \u2014 that she made the decision to remove her clothes and get in the hot tub with him \u2014 a mistake which Rose immediately regretted. Rose never once used the word rape in that conversation. Despite this, Jill recognized that Harvey had done something untoward to Rose, if not illegal. She immediately went to her bosses, the partners of Addis Wechsler, to recount Rose's story and to insist that they immediately address the situation. They told Jill that they would handle the situation. The ensuing arrangements between Rose and Harvey were then negotiated, completely without Jill's knowledge. At that time, all Jill knew was that the matter was settled and that Rose continued making films with the Weinsteins. She never knew any details until recently, when Rose elected to make them public.\n\nTen months later, in November of 1997, Jill received a call from the Miramax exec VP of production, recruiting her for a job as an executive at Miramax Films working in production in Los Angeles. Jill was hired based on merit and her excellent work of over two years as a young development executive working with Woods Entertainment (prior to her time at Addis Wechsler).\n\nRose's most recent round of press to promote her book has included new stories involving Jill. The constant press attention Rose has garnered in print and on national TV led to Harvey Weinstein releasing two documents. One of these was an email that Jill wrote to him months prior to the first New York Times piece coming out, and at his request. In this email, Jill offered the truth based on what she remembers Rose telling her about the Sundance account. In the face of Rose's continued and embellished accusations last week, Harvey took it upon himself to release the email without her consent.\n\nFive years ago, Jill suffered a manic episode. Anyone familiar with bipolar disorder knows that it is a cruel and vicious disease. With the help of doctors, her family and friends, Jill rebounded. Jill had fought to put her life back together. After a long job search, she was in negotiations to run the production division for a new entertainment company.\n\nSeeing her name in headlines again and again, as part of one person's attempt to gain more attention for her personal cause, along with Harvey's desperate attempt to vindicate himself, was devastating for her. It broke Jill, who was just starting to get her life back on track. What makes Rose's inaccurate accusations and insinuations against Jill ironic was that she was the first person who stood up on Rose's behalf, and alerted her bosses to the horrific experience which Rose suffered. Twenty years ago, as a very junior person in a management company hierarchy, Jill exhibited her integrity in doing the right thing \u2014 she raised the red flag with the heads of her firm. In the face of inappropriate behavior, Jill handled the situation appropriately.\n\nHers is one of the only stories that has stayed consistent over time as we watch other media reported tales morph to beget further attention.\n\nWhile journalists serve an important role in exposing predatory behavior, we are seeing irresponsible choices and an addiction to sensationalism which leads to inconsistent storytelling. The media is a powerful tool not to be taken lightly. Most individuals would be horrified to have their name spotlighted in a major international news story \u2014 let alone their photograph. We cannot forget that the media is a fearsome tool which cannot be used indiscriminately or even inadvertently to create further victims.\n\nThere is a responsibility when using a platform to accurately expose criminals, predators, mistruths and misdeeds while protecting the actual truth of third parties.\n\nAs we collectively seek to take action in an effort to right the wrongs so brazenly and inhumanely repeated for a generation, we must not forget one simple truth: Words have power. While we illuminate the dark corners for hidden truths, we must remember that what we say, particularly in the media, can have just as much impact if not more than our actions. We must ask more of ourselves, and of each other. We must take a moment to consider the ramifications and consequences of what we say and what we do.\n\nWords matter.\n\nSomeone's life may depend on it."}

{"label": true, "txt": "American singer-songwriter\n\nTaylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. One of the world's leading contemporary recording artists, she is known for narrative songs about her personal life, which have received widespread media coverage.\n\nBorn and raised in Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee at the age of 14 to pursue a career in country music. She signed with the label Big Machine Records and became the youngest artist ever signed by the Sony/ATV Music publishing house. Her 2006 self-titled debut album peaked at number five on the Billboard 200 and spent the most weeks on the chart in the 2000s. The album's third single, \"Our Song\", made her the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a number-one song on the Hot Country Songs chart. Swift's second album, Fearless, was released in 2008. Buoyed by the success of pop crossover singles \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\", Fearless became the best-selling album of 2009 in the US. The album won four Grammy Awards, with Swift becoming the youngest Album of the Year winner.\n\nSwift was the sole writer of her 2010 album, Speak Now. It debuted at number one in the United States and the single \"Mean\" won two Grammy Awards. Her fourth album, Red (2012), yielded the successful singles \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\" and \"I Knew You Were Trouble\". For her fifth album, the pop-focused 1989 (2014), she received three Grammys, and became the first woman and fifth act overall to win Album of the Year twice. Its singles \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\" reached number one in the US, Australia, and Canada. Swift's sixth album, Reputation (2017) and its lead single \"Look What You Made Me Do\" topped the UK and US charts; with the former, she became the first act to have four albums sell one million copies within one week in the US.\n\nSwift is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 40 million albums\u2014including 27.8 million in the US\u2014and 130 million single downloads. As a songwriter, she has received awards from the Nashville Songwriters Association and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and was included in Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time in 2015.

She has appeared in Time's 100 most influential people in the world (2010 and 2015) and Forbes' lists of top-earning women in music (2011\u20132015), 100 most powerful women (2015), and Celebrity 100 (2016). Her inclusion in the third of these made her the youngest woman on the list, and she ranked first in Celebrity 100.\n\nLife and career\n\n1989\u20132003: Early life\n\nTaylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in Reading, Pennsylvania.[1] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (n\u00e9e Finlay), was a homemaker who had worked as a mutual fund marketing executive.[2] Swift was named after the American singer-songwriter James Taylor.[3] She has a younger brother named Austin.[4] Swift spent the early years of her life on a Christmas tree farm which her father purchased from one of his clients.[5][6] She attended preschool and kindergarten at the Alvernia Montessori School, run by Franciscan nuns,[7] before transferring to The Wyndcroft School.[8] The family then moved to a rented house in the suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania,[9] where she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[10]\n\nAt the age of nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions.[11] She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[12] Swift later shifted her focus toward country music inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her \"want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything\".[13] She spent her weekends performing at local festivals and events.[14][15] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure that she needed to go to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a music career.[16] At the age of eleven, she traveled with her mother to visit Nashville record labels and submitted a demo tape of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.[17] However, she was rejected since \"everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different\".[18]\n\nWhen Swift was about 12 years old, computer repairman and local musician Ronnie Cremer taught her how to play guitar and helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading to her writing \"Lucky You\".[19][20] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York-based music manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modelled for Abercrombie & Fitch as part of their \"Rising Stars\" campaign, had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD, and attended meetings with major record labels.[21] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, Swift was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother.[22][23]\n\nTo help Swift break into country music, her father transferred to the Nashville office of Merrill Lynch when she was 14, and the family relocated to a lakefront house in Hendersonville, Tennessee.[5][24] Swift attended Hendersonville High School,[25] but after two years transferred to the Aaron Academy, which through homeschooling could accommodate her touring schedule, and she graduated a year early.[26]\n\n2004\u20132008: Career beginnings and Taylor Swift\n\nIn Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and The Warren Brothers.[27][28] She eventually formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[29] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[30] Rose thought that the sessions were \"some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks\". Swift was signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house,[31] but left RCA Records when she was 14.[15] She later recalled: \"I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through\".[32]\n\nSwift was at an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005 when she caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form his own independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had met Borchetta in 2004.[33] Swift became one of the first signings, and her father purchased a three percent stake in the fledgling company at an estimated cost of $120,000.[34][35] She began working on her eponymous debut album shortly after signing the record deal, and persuaded Big Machine to hire her demo producer Nathan Chapman, with whom she felt she had the right \"chemistry\".[15] Swift wrote three of the album's songs alone, and co-wrote the remaining eight with writers Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[36] Taylor Swift was released on October 24, 2006.[37] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times described it as \"a small masterpiece of pop-minded country, both wide-eyed and cynical, held together by Ms. Swift's firm, pleading voice\".[38] Taylor Swift peaked at number five on the Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States and spent 157 weeks on the ranking, marking the longest stay on the chart by any release in the country in the 2000s decade.[39] As of August 2016 the album has sold over 7.75 million copies worldwide.[40]\n\nBig Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, \"Tim McGraw\", and Swift and her mother helped \"stuff the CD singles into envelopes to send to radio\".[41] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances.[42][43] Borchetta has said that record industry peers disliked his signing of a 16-year-old singer-songwriter at first, but that Swift tapped into a previously unknown market\u2014teenage girls who listen to country music.[5] Following \"Tim McGraw\", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Our Song\", \"Picture to Burn\" and \"Should've Said No\". All were highly successful on Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart in the United States, with \"Our Song\" and \"Should've Said No\" both reaching number one. For the former, Swift became the youngest person to single-handedly write and perform a number-one song on the chart.[44] \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" became a moderate commercial success, reaching number thirteen on the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart in the United States.[45] Swift also released the holiday album Sounds of the Season: The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and the EP Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[46][47] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other artists on their tours.[48]\n\nSwift won accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person to be honored with the title.[49] She also won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for Best New Artist,[50] the Academy of Country Music Awards' Top New Female Vocalist,[51] and the American Music Awards' Favorite Country Female Artist honor.[52] She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 2008 Grammy Awards.[53] In July of that year, Swift began a romance with Joe Jonas that ended three months later.[54][55]\n\n2008\u20132010: Fearless and acting\n\nSwift's second studio album, Fearless, was released on November 11, 2008.[37] The lead single, \"Love Story\", was released in September 2008. It peaked at number four on the Billboard Hot 100[56] and number one in Australia.[57] Four more singles were released throughout 2008 and 2009: \"White Horse\", \"You Belong with Me\", \"Fifteen\" and \"Fearless\". \"You Belong with Me\" was the album's highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number two.[58] The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and was the top-selling album of 2009 in the United States.[59] The album received promotion from Swift's first concert tour, the Fearless Tour,[60] which grossed over $63 million.[61] Taylor Swift: Journey to Fearless, a concert film, was aired on television and later released on DVD and Blu-ray.[62] Swift also performed as a supporting act for Keith Urban's Escape Together World Tour.[63]\n\nIn 2009, the music video for \"You Belong with Me\" was named MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video.[66] Her acceptance speech was interrupted by rapper Kanye West.[67] The incident was the subject of controversy and frequent media attention, resulting in many Internet memes.[68] James Montgomery of MTV argued that the incident and subsequent media attention turned Swift into \"a bona-fide mainstream celebrity\".[69] Also that year, she won five American Music Awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[70] Billboard named her 2009's Artist of the Year.[71] The album ranked number 99 on NPR's 2017 list of the 150 Greatest Albums Made By Women.[72]\n\nAt the 52nd Grammy Awards, Fearless was named Album of the Year and Best Country Album, and \"White Horse\" was named Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance. Swift was the youngest artist ever to win Album of the Year.[73] During the ceremony, Swift sang \"You Belong with Me\" and \"Rhiannon\" with Stevie Nicks. Her vocal performance received negative reviews and a media backlash.[69][74] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times found it \"refreshing to see someone so gifted make the occasional flub\" and described Swift as \"the most important new pop star of the past few years\".[75] Swift became the youngest ever artist to be named Entertainer of the Year by the Country Music Association.[76] Fearless also won the Association's Album of the Year award.[77]\n\nSwift contributed backing vocals to John Mayer's \"Half of My Heart\", a single featured on his fourth album, Battle Studies (2009).[78] She co-wrote and recorded \"Best Days of Your Life\" with Kellie Pickler,[79] and co-wrote two songs for the Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack\u2014\"You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home\" and \"Crazier\".[65] Swift also provided vocals for Boys Like Girls' \"Two Is Better Than One\".[80] She contributed two songs to the Valentine's Day soundtrack, including \"Today Was a Fairytale\", which became her first number one on the Canadian Hot 100 chart.[81][82] While filming her cinematic debut Valentine's Day in October 2009, Swift began a romantic relationship with co-star Taylor Lautner, but they broke up later that year.[83][84] The romantic comedy, released the following year, saw her play the ditzy girlfriend of a high school jock, a role in which Los Angeles Times found \"serious comedic potential\".[85] In a scathing review, the critic for Variety deemed her \"entirely undirected\", arguing that \"she needs to find a skilled director to tamp her down and channel her obviously abundant energy\".[86]\n\nSwift made her acting debut in a 2009 episode of CBS's CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, playing a rebellious teenager. The New York Times noted that the character allowed Swift to be \"a little bit naughty, and credibly so\".[87] Later that year, Swift both hosted and performed as the musical guest for an episode of Saturday Night Live.[88] Entertainment Weekly described her as \"this season's best Saturday Night Live host so far\", noting that she \"was always up for the challenge, seemed to be having fun, and helped the rest of the cast nail the punchlines\".[89] Later in 2010, she briefly dated actor Jake Gyllenhaal.[90]\n\n2010\u20132014: Speak Now and Red\n\nIn August 2010, Swift released \"Mine\", the lead single from her third studio album, Speak Now. It entered the United States at number three, making Swift the second female artist in the history of the Hot 100 (after Mariah Carey) to debut multiple tracks in the top five in one year; the other was \"Today Was a Fairytale\" at number two.[91] Swift wrote the album alone and co produced every track.[92] Speak Now, released on October 25, 2010,[37] was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the Billboard 200, and becoming the 16th album to achieve opening week sales of one million copies.[93] It became the fastest-selling digital album by a female artist, with 278,000 downloads in a week, earning Swift an entry in the 2010 Guinness World Records. She earned another Guinness World Record entry after she became the first woman to achieve 10 track debuts on the Billboard Hot 100.[94][95] Three of the album's singles, \"Mine\", \"Back to December\", and \"Mean\", peaked in the top ten in Canada.[82]\n\n\"Mean\" won Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance at the 54th Annual Grammy Awards.[96] Swift performed the song during the ceremony. Claire Suddath of Time felt she \"delivered her comeback on-key and with a vengeance\";[97] Jayme Deerwester of USA Today wrote that the criticism in 2010 seemed to have \"made her a better songwriter and live performer\".[98] Swift won various other awards for Speak Now, including Songwriter/Artist of the Year by the Nashville Songwriters Association (2010 and 2011),[99][100] Woman of the Year by Billboard (2011),[101] and Entertainer of the Year by the Academy of Country Music (2011 and 2012)[102] and the Country Music Association in 2011.[103] At the American Music Awards of 2011, Swift won Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[104] Rolling Stone placed Speak Now at number 45 in its 2012 list of the \"50 Best Female Albums of All Time\", writing: \"She might get played on the country station, but she's one of the few genuine rock stars we've got these days, with a flawless ear for what makes a song click.\"[105]\n\nThe Speak Now World Tour ran from February 2011 to March 2012 and grossed over $123 million.[106] In November 2011, Swift released her first live album, Speak Now World Tour: Live.[107] The following month, she contributed two original songs to The Hunger Games soundtrack album: \"Safe & Sound\", cowritten and recorded with the Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett, and \"Eyes Open\". \"Safe & Sound\" won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media.[108] After providing vocals for B.o.B's \"Both of Us\" in May 2012,[109] Swift dated political heir Conor Kennedy from July to September 2012.[110] In August, Swift released \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", the lead single from her fourth studio album, Red. It became her first number one in the US and New Zealand[111][112] and reached the top slot on iTunes' digital song sales chart 50 minutes after its release, earning the \"Fastest Selling Single in Digital History\" Guinness World Record.[113] Swift released the album's second single, \"Begin Again\", in October. It reached number seven on the Billboard Hot 100.[114] Other singles released from the album include \"I Knew You Were Trouble\", \"22\", \"Everything Has Changed\", \"The Last Time\", and \"Red\". \"I Knew You Were Trouble\" was a major commercial success,[115] peaking at number two in the United States.[114]\n\nRed was released on October 22, 2012,[37] incorporating new genres for Swift, such as heartland rock, dubstep and dance-pop. The album was a critical and commercial success,[13] and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 1.21 million copies. This marked the highest opening sales in a decade in the United States, and made Swift the first female to have two million-selling album openings, a record recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records.[116][117] The Red Tour ran from March 2013 to June 2014 and grossed over $150 million.[118] Red earned several accolades, including four nominations at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards.[119] Its single \"I Knew You Were Trouble\" won Best Female Video at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards.[120] Swift was named Best Female Country Artist at the 2012 American Music Awards and Artist of the Year at the 2013 ceremony.[121][122] She received the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist Award for the fifth and sixth consecutive years in 2012 and 2013 respectively.[123] Swift was also honored by the Association with a special Pinnacle Award, making her the second recipient of the accolade after Garth Brooks.[124]\n\nIn 2013, Swift cowrote \"Sweeter Than Fiction\" with Jack Antonoff for the One Chance soundtrack, and received a Best Original Song nomination at the 71st Golden Globe Awards.[125] She provided guest vocals for Tim McGraw's song \"Highway Don't Care\", featuring guitar work by Keith Urban.[126] Swift performed \"As Tears Go By\" with the Rolling Stones in Chicago, Illinois as part of their 50 & Counting tour,[127] and stated that the band was a major influence on her career outlook.[128] She also joined Florida Georgia Line on stage during their set at the 2013 Country Radio Seminar to sing \"Cruise\".[129] Outside music, Swift voiced Audrey, a tree lover, in the animated film The Lorax (2012),[130] made a cameo in the sitcom New Girl (2013),[131] and had a supporting role in the film adaptation of The Giver (2014).[132] During this time, she dated British singer Harry Styles.[133]\n\n2014\u20132016: 1989\n\nIn March 2014, Swift relocated to New York City.[134] Around this time, she was working on her fifth studio album, 1989, with writers Antonoff, Max Martin, Shellback, Imogen Heap, Ryan Tedder, and Ali Payami.[135] She promoted the album through various campaigns, including inviting fans to secret album-listening sessions, called the \"1989 Secret Sessions\".[136] Credited as her \"first documented, official pop album\", it marked a departure from her previous country albums.[137] The album was released on October 27, 2014 to positive reviews.[37][138]\n\nSwift at the 1989 World Tour , which grossed $250 million and became one of the highest-grossing tours of the decade\n\n1989 sold 1.28 million copies in the US during the first week of release and debuted atop the Billboard 200\u2014this made Swift the first act to have three albums sell more than one million copies in their opening release week, for which she earned a Guinness World Record.[139][140] As of June 2017, 1989 had sold over 10 million copies worldwide.[141] The album's lead single, \"Shake It Off\", was released in August 2014 and debuted at number one on the Billboard Hot 100.[142] The album also generated two additional number-one singles\u2014\"Blank Space\" and \"Bad Blood\" (featuring Kendrick Lamar)\u2014as well as the top-ten entries \"Style\" and \"Wildest Dreams\", and other singles \"Out of the Woods\" and \"New Romantics\".[143] \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\" also topped the charts in Australia and Canada.[57][82] After \"Blank Space\" reached number-one in the US following \"Shake It Off\", Swift became the first woman in the Hot 100's history to succeed herself at the top spot.[144] The music video for the former briefly became the fastest video to reach one billion views on Vevo.[145] The videos for \"Blank Space\" and \"Bad Blood\" won four accolades at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards, with the latter winning for Video of the Year and Best Collaboration.[146] Swift's headlining tour, the 1989 World Tour, running from May to December 2015, grossed over $250 million, and became one of the highest-grossing tours of the decade.[147]\n\nSwift was named Billboard's Woman of the Year in 2014, becoming the first artist to win the award twice.[148] Also that year, she received the Dick Clark Award for Excellence at the American Music Awards.[149] In 2015, \"Shake It Off\" was nominated for three Grammy Awards, including Record of the Year and Song of the Year and Swift won the Brit Award for International Female Solo Artist.[150][151] Swift was one of eight artists to receive a 50th Anniversary Milestone Award at the 2015 Academy of Country Music Awards.[152] In 2016, Swift won three Grammy Awards for 1989\u2014Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album, and Best Music Video for \"Bad Blood\". She became the first woman, and fifth act overall, to win the first of these twice.[153]\n\nPrior to 1989's release, Swift stressed the importance of albums to artists and fans.[154] In November 2014, she removed her entire catalog from Spotify, arguing that the streaming company's ad-supported, free service undermined the premium service, which provides higher royalties for songwriters.[155] In a June 2015 open letter, Swift criticized Apple Music for not offering royalties to artists during the streaming service's free three-month trial period and stated that she would pull 1989 from the catalog.[156] The following day, Apple announced that it would pay artists during the free trial period,[157] and Swift agreed to stream 1989 on the streaming service.[158] Swift's intellectual property rights management and holding company, TAS Rights Management, filed for 73 trademarks related to Swift and the 1989 era memes.[159] She re-added her entire catalog to Spotify, Amazon Music and Google Play in June 2017.[160]\n\nIn 2015, Swift performed \"I Saw Her Standing There\" and \"Shake It Off\" with Paul McCartney at the Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special after-party,[161] and joined Kenny Chesney to sing \"Big Star\" on the opening night of his Big Revival Tour in Nashville.[162] In March 2015, Swift started dating Scottish DJ and record producer Calvin Harris.[163] By June 2015, the duo were ranked as the highest-paid celebrity couple over the past year by Forbes with combined earnings of over $146 million.[164] In August, Swift addressed her mother's cancer diagnosis, and encouraged others to get a medical checkup.[165] Before Swift and Harris announced the end of their relationship in June 2016,[166] the two co-wrote his song \"This Is What You Came For\" (featuring Rihanna), for which she was initially credited under the pseudonym Nils Sj\u00f6berg.[167] In October, she penned Little Big Town's \"Better Man\" for their seventh album, The Breaker.[168] The song earned Swift an award for Song of the Year at the 51st CMA Awards.[169] Two months later, Swift and Zayn Malik released a single together called \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever\", for the soundtrack of the film Fifty Shades Darker (2017). The song reached number one in Sweden and peaked at number two in the United States.[170][171] At the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards, the duo won the award for Best Collaboration for the song's music video.[172] In September 2016, Swift began dating English actor Joe Alwyn.[173]\n\n2017\u2013present: Reputation\n\nIn August 2017, Swift sued and prevailed in a civil trial against David Mueller, a former morning show personality for Denver's KYGO-FM. Four years earlier, Swift had informed Mueller's bosses that he had sexually assaulted her by groping her at an event. After being fired, Mueller accused Swift of lying and sued her for making him lose his job. Shortly after, Swift counter-sued for sexual assault. The jury rejected Mueller's claims and ruled in favor of Swift.[174] Swift thereafter cleared her social media accounts[175] and released \"Look What You Made Me Do\" as the lead single from her sixth album, Reputation.[176] The song topped the charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States.[177][178] Its music video gained over 43.2 million views during its first day on YouTube, breaking the site's record for the most-viewed music video within 24 hours.[179] In October, Swift released the album's second single, \"...Ready for It?\",[180] which charted at number three in Australia and at number four in the United States.[181][178]\n\nTwo promotional singles were released from Reputation, \"Gorgeous\" and \"Call It What You Want\"; the former later became the album's fifth single, however only being released as such in Europe.[182] The album was released on November 10 and sold 1.216 million copies in the United States\u2014becoming 2017's top-selling album (pure sales only) in the country\u2014and 2 million copies worldwide during its first week.[183] With this achievement, she became the first act to have four albums sell one million copies within one week in the US.[184] The album topped the charts in several countries, including the US, the UK, Australia and Canada.[185][186] Later that month, Swift performed \"...Ready for It?\" and \"Call It What You Want\" on Saturday Night Live.[187] \"End Game\", featuring Ed Sheeran and Future, followed in November as the third single, and peaked at number 18 in the US.[188] Other singles from the album include \"New Year's Day\" and \"Delicate\", the former of which was released exclusively to country radio.[189]\n\nIn April 2018, Swift featured on Sugarland's \"Babe\" from their album Bigger.[a] In support of Reputation, Swift embarked on Taylor Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour from May to November 2018.[191] The tour broke multiple venue attendance and grossing records in the United States, earning $266.1 million and selling more than two million tickets. As a result, Swift broke her own record for the highest-grossing domestic tour by a woman[b] and surpassed The Rolling Stones' $245 million-grossing A Bigger Bang Tour (2005\u20132007).[192] Worldwide, the tour grossed $345.7 million,[193] making it the second highest-grossing concert tour of the year.[194] At the American Music Awards of 2018, Swift won Tour of the Year for the tour, Artist of the Year, Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist, and Favorite Pop/Rock Album for Reputation. With a total of 23 awards, she became the most awarded female winner in AMA history, a record previously held by Whitney Houston.[195] Reputation has been nominated for Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album.[196]\n\nReputation was Swift's last album under her 12-year contract with Big Machine Records. On November 19, 2018, Swift signed a new multi-album deal with Big Machine's distributor Universal Music Group; in the United States, her future releases will be promoted under the Republic Records imprint. Swift stated that the contract included provisions for her to maintain ownership of her master recordings. In addition, UMG agreed to, in the event that it sells portions of its stake in Spotify, distribute proceeds among its artists and make them non-recoupable.[197]\n\nIn July 2018, Swift was cast as Bombalurina in the movie adaptation of the musical Cats.[198][199]\n\nArtistry\n\nInfluences\n\nOne of Swift's earliest musical memories is listening to her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, sing in church.[2] As a child, she enjoyed Disney film soundtracks: \"My parents noticed that, once I had run out of words, I would just make up my own\".[200] Swift has said she owes her confidence to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child.[201] She also attributes her \"fascination with writing and storytelling\" to her mother.[202] Swift was drawn to the storytelling of country music,[203] and was introduced to the genre by \"the great female country artists of the '90s\"\u2014Shania Twain, Faith Hill, and the Dixie Chicks.[204][205] Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence.[206] Hill was Swift's childhood role model: \"Everything she said, did, wore, I tried to copy it\".[207] She admired the Dixie Chicks' defiant attitude and their ability to play their own instruments.[208] The band's \"Cowboy Take Me Away\" was the first song Swift learned to play on the guitar.[209] Swift also explored the music of older country stars, including Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, and Tammy Wynette.[14] She believes Parton is \"an amazing example to every female songwriter out there\".[210] Alt-country artists such as Ryan Adams,[211] Patty Griffin[212] and Lori McKenna have inspired Swift.[5]\n\nSwift lists Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones,[128] Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, Kris Kristofferson, and Carly Simon as her career role models: \"They've taken chances, but they've also been the same artist for their entire careers\".[5][213] McCartney, both as a Beatle and a solo artist, makes Swift feel \"as if I've been let into his heart and his mind ... Any musician could only dream of a legacy like that\".[214] She admires Springsteen for being \"so musically relevant after such a long period of time\".[215] She aspires to be like Harris as she grows older: \"It's not about fame for her, it's about music\".[216] \"[Kristofferson] shines in songwriting ... He's just one of those people who has been in this business for years but you can tell it hasn't chewed him up and spat him out\", Swift says.[217] She admires Simon's \"songwriting and honesty ... She's known as an emotional person but a strong person\".[218]\n\nSwift has also been influenced by many artists outside the country genre. As a pre-teen, she enjoyed bubblegum pop acts including Hanson and Britney Spears; Swift has said she has \"unwavering devotion\" for Spears.[219][220] In her high school years, Swift listened to rock bands such as Dashboard Confessional,[221] Fall Out Boy,[222] and Jimmy Eat World.[223] She has also spoken fondly of singers and songwriters like Michelle Branch,[223] Alanis Morissette,[224] Ashlee Simpson,[225] Fefe Dobson,[223] Colbie Caillat,[226] Beyonc\u00e9,[227] and Justin Timberlake;[228] and the 1960s acts The Shirelles, Doris Troy, and The Beach Boys.[229] Swift's fifth album, the pop-focused 1989, was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including Annie Lennox, Phil Collins and \"Like a Prayer-era Madonna\".[230]\n\nMusical style\n\nSwift's music contains elements of pop, pop rock, and country.[231] She described herself as a country artist until the 2014 release of 1989, which she described as a \"sonically cohesive pop album\".[232] Rolling Stone wrote: \"[Swift] might get played on the country station, but she's one of the few genuine rock stars we've got these days.\"[233] According to The New York Times, \"There isn't much in Ms. Swift's music to indicate country\u2014a few banjo strums, a pair of cowboy boots worn onstage, a bedazzled guitar\u2014but there's something in her winsome, vulnerable delivery that's unique to Nashville\".[234] The Guardian wrote that Swift \"cranks melodies out with the pitiless efficiency of a Scandinavian pop factory\".[235]\n\nSwift's vocals were described by Sophie Schillaci of The Hollywood Reporter as \"sweet, but soft\".[236] The Los Angeles Times identified Swift's \"defining\" vocal gesture in studio recordings as \"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow, giving her beloved girl-time hits their air of easy intimacy\".[237] Rolling Stone, in a Speak Now review, wrote: \"Swift's voice is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer; she lowers her voice for the payoff lines in the classic mode of a shy girl trying to talk tough.\"[238] In another review of Speak Now, The Village Voice wrote that her phrasing was previously \"bland and muddled, but that's changed. She can still sound strained and thin, and often strays into a pitch that drives some people crazy; but she's learned how to make words sound like what they mean.\"[239] The Hollywood Reporter wrote that her live vocals are \"fine\", but they do not match those of her peers.[236] In 2009, Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly described Swift's vocals as \"flat, thin, and sometimes as wobbly as a newborn colt\".[240] However, Swift has received praise for refusing to correct her pitch with Auto-Tune.[241]\n\nIn an interview with The New Yorker, Swift characterized herself primarily as a songwriter: \"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across.\"[5] A writer for The Tennessean conceded in 2010 that Swift is \"not the best technical singer\", but described her as the \"best communicator that we've got\".[242] Swift's vocal presence is something that concerns her and she has \"put a lot of work\" into improving it.[243] It was reported in 2010 that she continues to take vocal lessons.[244] She has said that she only feels nervous performing \"if I'm not sure what the audience thinks of me, like at award shows\".[245]\n\nSongwriting\n\nSwift uses her life experiences as an inspiration in her work.[246] In her songs, Swift often addresses the \"anonymous crushes of her high school years\" and celebrities.[247] Swift frequently criticizes ex-boyfriends,[248] an aspect of her songwriting downplayed by The Village Voice: \"Being told What Songs Mean is like having a really pushy professor. And it imperils a true appreciation of Swift's talent, which is not confessional, but dramatic.\"[249] However, New York believes the media scrutiny over her decision to \"mine her personal life for music ... is sexist, inasmuch as it's not asked of her male peers\".[250] Swift said that not all her songs are factual and that they are sometimes based on observations.[251] Aside from her liner note clues, Swift tries not to talk about song subjects specifically \"because these are real people. You try to give insight as to where you were coming from as a writer without completely throwing somebody under the bus\".[252]\n\nSwift during her Speak Now World Tour in Pittsburgh, 2011\n\nFor a female to write about her feelings, and then be portrayed as some clingy, insane, desperate girlfriend in need of making you marry her and have kids with her, I think that's taking something that potentially should be celebrated\u2014a woman writing about her feelings in a confessional way\u2014that's taking it and turning it and twisting it into something that is frankly a little sexist. Swift in response to criticism of her songwriting[253]\n\nThe Guardian has praised Swift for writing about teenage years \"with a kind of wistful, sepia-toned nostalgia\" over the course of her first two albums.[235] New York has remarked that many singer-songwriters have made great records as teens, but \"none made great records so explicitly about their teens\". The magazine has also compared her work to Brian Wilson.[254] In Fearless, Swift featured fairy tale imagery and explored the disconnect \"between fairy tales and the reality of love\".[255] Her later albums address more adult relationships.[213] In addition to romance and love, Swift's songs have discussed parent-child relationships, friendships,[256][257] alienation, fame, and career ambitions.[202] Swift frequently includes \"a tossed-off phrase to suggest large and serious things that won't fit in the song, things that enhance or subvert the surface narrative\".[258]\n\nRolling Stone describes Swift as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\".[259] According to The Village Voice, she uses third-verse point of view reversals frequently.[258] In terms of imagery, repetition is evident in Swift's songwriting. In The Guardian's words, \"she spends so much time kissin' in the rain that it seems a miracle she hasn't developed trenchfoot\".[235] Slant Magazine adds, \"to Swift's credit, she explores new lyrical motifs over the course of [her fourth] album\".[260] Although reviews of Swift's work are \"almost uniformly positive\", The New Yorker has said she is generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary\".[5]\n\nPublic image\n\nSwift's personal life is the subject of constant media attention.[261] In 2013, Abercrombie & Fitch marketed a slogan T-shirt with a \"slut-shaming\" remark directed toward her.[262] The New York Times asserted that her \"dating history has begun to stir what feels like the beginning of a backlash\" and questioned whether Swift was in the midst of a \"quarter-life crisis\".[263] Swift has said that she is unwilling to discuss her personal life in public,[261] as she believes that talking about it can be \"a career weakness\".[264]\n\nSwift at the 2010 Time 100 Gala, where she was honored\n\nRolling Stone remarks upon her polite manner: \"If this is Swift's game face, it must be tattooed on because it never drops.\"[265] The magazine also takes note of her \"ease with glad-handing\",[34] and The Hollywood Reporter credits her as \"the Best People Person since Bill Clinton\".[266] While presenting Swift an award for her humanitarian endeavors in 2012, Michelle Obama described her as a singer who \"has rocketed to the top of the music industry but still keeps her feet on the ground, someone who has shattered every expectation of what a 22-year-old can accomplish\".[267] Swift considers Michelle Obama to be a role model.[268] Swift is one of the most followed people on social media, and is known for her friendly interactions with her fans.[269][270] She has delivered holiday gifts to fans by mail and in person, dubbed \"Swiftmas\".[271] She considers it her \"responsibility\" to be conscious of her influence on young fans,[272] and has said that her fans are \"the longest and best relationship I have ever had\".[273]\n\nOften described by the media as \"America's Sweetheart\",[274] Swift insists that \"I don't live by all these rigid, weird rules that make me feel all fenced in. I just like the way that I feel like, and that makes me feel very free\". She refuses to take part in overly sexualized photo-shoots,[275] although Bloomberg L.P. views her as a sex symbol.[276] Swift was named an Icon of American Style by Vogue in 2011.[277] In 2014 she topped People's annual best dressed list.[278] In 2015, she was named Woman of the Year at the Elle Style Awards,[279] and ranked first in Maxim's Hot 100 list.[280]\n\nSwift has also appeared in various power listings.

In 2009, she donated $250,000 to various schools around the country for improvement of education.[305] Her other endeavors to promote literacy include donating 6,000 Scholastic books to Reading Public Library, Pennsylvania;[306] 14,000 books to Nashville Public Library, Tennessee;[307] 2,000 Scholastic books to the Reading Hospital Child Health Center's early literacy program;[308] and 25,000 books to New York City schools in 2015.[309]\n\nIn 2007, she launched a campaign to protect children from online predators, in partnership with the Tennessee Association of Chiefs of Police.[310] In 2009, Swift recorded a Sound Matters public service announcement (PSA) to make listeners aware of the importance of listening \"responsibly\" to prevent hearing impairment.[311] Swift has donated items for auction to several charities, including: the Elton John AIDS Foundation, the UNICEF Tap Project, MusiCares, and Feeding America.[312] As a recipient of the Academy of Country Music's Entertainer of the Year in 2011, Swift donated $25,000 to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Tennessee.[313] In 2012, Swift participated in the Stand Up to Cancer telethon, performing \"Ronan\", a song she wrote in memory of a four-year-old boy who died of neuroblastoma. The song was made available for digital download with all proceeds donated to cancer-related charities.[314] In 2014, she donated $100,000 to the V Foundation for Cancer Research,[315] and $50,000 to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.[316] She made private visits to hospitals to meet with sick patients and to support them.[317] Swift has encouraged young people to volunteer in their local communities as part of Global Youth Service Day.[318]\n\nIn 2018, she collaborated with 300 women in Hollywood to set up the Time's Up initiative to protect women from harassment and discrimination,[319] and donated $100,000 to its legal defense fund.[320] Later that year, Swift made a surprise appearance at a benefit concert in New York City raising money for LGBT equality.[321]\n\nPolitics\n\nDuring the 2008 presidential campaign, Swift promoted the Every Woman Counts campaign, aimed at engaging women in the political process, and was one of many country stars to record a PSA for the Vote (For Your) Country campaign.[322] She stated: \"I don't think it's my job to try and influence people which way they should vote.\"[14] Following Barack Obama's inauguration, she told Rolling Stone that she supported the president: \"I've never seen this country so happy about a political decision in my entire time of being alive. I'm so glad this was my first election.\"[323]\n\nIn a 2012 interview, Swift remarked that in spite of keeping herself \"as educated and informed as possible\", she does not discuss politics, fearing that it might influence other people.[324] Writing about media pressure on Swift to publicly take political stances, Politico called Swift \"studiously apolitical\".[325] Swift has spent time with the Kennedy family[326] and has spoken of her admiration for Ethel Kennedy.[217] Swift is also a feminist.[327] She has spoken out against LGBT discrimination.[328] Following the 2008 murder of Larry King, she recorded a GLSEN PSA to combat hate crimes.[329] On the first anniversary of King's death, Swift told Seventeen that her parents taught her \"never to judge others based on whom they love, what color their skin is, or their religion\".[330] The music video for Swift's anti-bullying song \"Mean\" deals in part with homophobia in high schools; the video was nominated for an MTV VMA social activism award in 2011.[331][332] The New York Times believes she is part of \"a new wave of young (and mostly straight) women who are providing the soundtrack for a generation of gay fans coming to terms with their identity in a time of turbulent and confusing cultural messages\".[331]\n\nPrior to the 2018 midterm elections, Swift endorsed candidates for public office for the first time, declaring her support for two Democratic candidates:[333][334] Congressman Jim Cooper for re-election to the House of Representatives, and former Governor of Tennessee Phil Bredesen for election to the Senate. She spoke out against Bredesen's opponent, Republican Congresswoman Marsha Blackburn, stating that her voting record \"appalled\" and \"terrified\" her. She expressed her desire for LGBT rights and gender and racial equality, and condemned systemic racism.[335] Vote.org, mentioned in Swift's post, reported that 65,000 people registered to vote in the 24 hours following Swift's post, an unprecedented surge even accounting for usual registration increases as deadlines approach.[336][337] During Swift's acceptance speech for Artist of the Year at the American Music Awards of 2018, she encouraged her fans to vote in the 2018 midterm elections.[195]\n\nProduct endorsements\n\nWhile promoting her debut album, Swift appeared as the face of Verizon Wireless' Mobile Music campaign.[338] In the Fearless era, she launched a l.e.i. sundress range at Wal-Mart,[339] and designed American Greetings cards and Jakks Pacific dolls.[340][341] She became a spokesperson for the National Hockey League's (NHL) Nashville Predators and Sony Cyber-shot digital cameras.[342][343] In the Speak Now era, she released a special edition of her album through Target.[344] Swift became a CoverGirl spokesmodel,[345] and launched two Elizabeth Arden fragrances\u2014Wonderstruck and Wonderstruck Enchanted.[346]\n\nWhile promoting her fourth album, Red, Swift offered exclusive album promotions through Target,[347] Papa John's Pizza,[348] and Walgreens.[349] She became a spokesmodel for Diet Coke and Keds sneakers,[350] released her third Elizabeth Arden fragrance named Taylor by Taylor Swift,[351] and continued her partnerships with Sony Electronics and American Greetings.[352][353] Swift also partnered with the companies AirAsia[354] and Qantas[355] during the Red Tour.

{"label": true, "txt": "Our September cover story, \u201cA Life in Bold,\u201d a portrait of actress Angelina Jolie by contributing editor Evgenia Peretz, has been the subject of some controversy, specifically the paragraph that follows, which describes the casting of Cambodian children in Jolie\u2019s upcoming film, First They Killed My Father:\n\n\u201cTo cast the children in the film, Jolie looked at orphanages, circuses, and slum schools, specifically seeking children who had experienced hardship. In order to find their lead, to play young Loung Ung, the casting directors set up a game, rather disturbing in its realism: they put money on the table and asked the child to think of something she needed the money for, and then to snatch it away. The director would pretend to catch the child, and the child would have to come up with a lie. \u2018Srey Moch [the girl ultimately chosen for the part] was the only child that stared at the money for a very, very long time,\u2019 Jolie says. \u2018When she was forced to give it back, she became overwhelmed with emotion. All these different things came flooding back.\u2019 Jolie then tears up. \u2018When she was asked later what the money was for, she said her grandfather had died, and they didn\u2019t have enough money for a nice funeral.\u2019\u201d\n\nSome reporters and readers raised concerns about the casting process. Jolie responded in a statement, saying the audition had been taken out of context, and added she was upset that \u201ca pretend exercise in an improvisation . . . had been written about as if it was a real scenario.\u201d She also stated \u201cthe suggestion that real money was taken from a child during an audition is false and upsetting. I would be outraged myself if this had happened.\u201d\n\nOn August 1, Jolie\u2019s lawyer contacted V.F., saying Peretz had \u201cmistakenly\u201d reported the incident, and asked us to run a statement, excerpts of which follow: \u201cThe casting crew showed the children the camera and sound recording material, explaining to them that they were going to be asked to act out a part. . . . The children were not tricked as some have suggested. . . . All of the children auditioning were made aware of the fictional aspect of the exercise and were tended to at all times by relatives or guardians from NGOs. . . . We apologize for any misunderstanding.\u201d\n\nJolie\u2019s lawyer also asked us to remove the original paragraph from the online version of Peretz\u2019s story and to publish the above statement prominently, with the title \u201cAngelina Jolie Correction\u201d in the October edition of V.F. and also on VF.com.\n\nIn response to these requests, V.F. reviewed the transcript and audiotape of Peretz\u2019s interview with Jolie for the story. Peretz had recorded it on two devices. A transcript of the relevant section is reproduced below.\n\nAJ: But it was very hard to find a little Loung. And so it was what they call a slum school. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a very nice word for it, but a school for kids in very poor areas.\n\nAnd I think, I mean they didn\u2019t know. We just went in and\u2014you just go in and do some auditions with the kids. And it\u2019s not really an audition with children. We had this game where it would be\u2014and I wasn\u2019t there and they didn\u2019t know what they were really doing. They kind of said, \u201cOh, a camera\u2019s coming up and we want to play a game with you.\u201d And the game for that character was \u201cWe\u2019re going to put some money on the table. Think of something that you need that money for.\u201d Sometimes it was money, sometimes it was a cookie.

They were actually\u2014there are so many talented kids in this country.

The 34-year-old opened up about her decision to take a step back from modeling in her cover interview for Net-a-Porter\u2019s digital magazine, The Edit, saying she\u2019s focusing now on her organic skincare line, Kora Organics, thanks to a push from her new hubby, Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel.\n\nSo how is she adjusting to life away from the cameras and inside the Kora offices?

You need to take a risk. If you believe in this, put everything into it.'\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Jada Pinkett Smith Talks Celebrating 20 Years with Will Smith\n\nShe adds: \u201cI\u2019ve modeled for 20 years, it\u2019s just not a priority anymore,\u201d she says. \u201cNow, if an opportunity comes up, I think, \u2018Is this in the best interest of my family?\u2019 and \u2018Will this interrupt Kora?\u2019 If it passes through those two gates, and if the shoot\u2019s in LA, then\u2026\u201d\n\nRELATED PHOTOS: They Do!

{"label": true, "txt": "Every week this NFL season, we will celebrate the electric plays, admonish the colossal blunders, and explain the inexplicable moments of the most recent slate. Welcome to Winners and Losers. Which one are you?\n\nWinner: Mr. Irrelevant and Guys Who Went Undrafted\n\nThe last player selected in each NFL draft is given the title \u201cMr. Irrelevant.\u201d For all of the exposure created by this distinction, the name is generally fitting: This player tends to have a pro football career that is, well, rather irrelevant. Not counting this year\u2019s selection, only two Misters Irrelevant (2009\u2019s Ryan Succop and 2016\u2019s Kalan Reed) are currently on NFL rosters, and neither is with the team that drafted them. Succop is only the second Mr. Irrelevant since 2000 to ever start an NFL game; the other is David Vobora, who played linebacker for the Rams from 2008 to 2010. Heading into Week 12, no Mr. Irrelevant had scored a touchdown since 2000, when 1999\u2019s Mr. Irrelevant, fullback Jim Finn, caught the only touchdown pass of his career.\n\nNo Mr. Irrelevant until Thanksgiving, that is. On Thursday, Washington receiver Trey Quinn became relevant. Quinn not only had a big punt return, but also snagged a 10-yard touchdown catch, the first of his career:\n\n\u2705 30-yard punt return\n\n\u2705 Touchdown grab\n\n\n\n\"The Trey Quinn Drive.\"pic.twitter.com/3HWBG3702g \u2014 Sporting News (@sportingnews) November 22, 2018\n\nHe chose to commemorate the moment with a celebration from The Office, the only time imitating Michael Scott in real life has been a good decision:\n\nQuinn was playing in just his third career game, as an ankle sprain kept him out for most of September and all of October. He finished the team\u2019s 31-23 loss to the Cowboys with five catches on six targets. The 256th overall pick last April is suddenly a legitimate part of Washington\u2019s passing offense.\n\nOf course, Mr. Irrelevant isn\u2019t the only player who gets passed over in every draft. While there\u2019s just one Mr. Irrelevant, there are hundreds of undrafted players who try to fight their way onto rosters every year\u2014and like Quinn, some of those players also made an impact this Thanksgiving. Although the most prolific receiver in the Saints\u2019 record-setting passing attack this season has been 2016 second-rounder Michael Thomas, all four passing touchdowns Drew Brees threw in New Orleans\u2019s 31-17 win against the Falcons were caught by undrafted players. Here\u2019s some guy named Dan Arnold, a tight end from Division III Wisconsin-Platteville, beating Atlanta\u2019s defense over the top and laying out to catch a gorgeous pass:\n\nDan Arnold LAYS OUT for the TD grab! @DrewBrees' third score of the night. #GoSaints\n\n\n\n: #ATLvsNO on NBC pic.twitter.com/UTXJ1hEqc9 \u2014 NFL (@NFL) November 23, 2018\n\nAnd here\u2019s a wideout named Tommylee Lewis getting loose downfield:\n\nBrees finds a wide-open Tommylee Lewis for a 28-yard touchdown! #ATLvsNO pic.twitter.com/qdTzvgZDIa \u2014 New Orleans Saints (@Saints) November 23, 2018\n\nKeith Kirkwood and Austin Carr also reeled in scores. The Saints made history by throwing so many touchdowns to so many undrafted players:\n\nFrom @ESPNStatsInfo: Saints are first team in Super Bowl era to have 4 different undrafted players with receiving TD in a game. FROM ELIAS: Saints are first team since 1984 Steelers to have 4 different players score their 1st-or-2nd career TD in the same game \u2014 Mike Triplett (@MikeTriplett) November 23, 2018\n\nAs the famous Saints cheer goes, \u201cWho dat? Who dat? \u2026 No, seriously, who is that? I follow this team closely, and I haven\u2019t heard that name in my life.\u201d\n\nWhile this bevy of scores helped virtually nobody\u2019s fantasy team, it highlighted the truly incredible season that New Orleans is having. The team has been forced into starting some of these unknowns: Tre\u2019Quan Smith was a surprise scratch on Thursday with a foot injury, while new receiver acquisition Brandon Marshall isn\u2019t yet ready to play. With Ted Ginn Jr., Cameron Meredith, and Dez Bryant already on injured reserve, the Saints are trotting out anybody with hands and gloves.\n\nWith almost any other team, this rash of injuries would be disastrous. For Brees, though, it hasn\u2019t been a problem. The spectacular outings by players seemingly generated in Madden\u2019s dynasty mode serves to bolster Brees\u2019s MVP case: How can anybody be more valuable than the QB setting records with a cast of pass catchers comprised of players every team in the league once graded as completely valueless?\n\nLoser: Markelle Fultz\n\nOther than Super Bowl Sunday, Thanksgiving is probably the day each year when the highest percentage of Americans watch the same thing. Almost everyone is off from work, and only one game happens at a time, so the league\u2019s Thanksgiving games are always among the highest-rated of the season. We all just sit around, eat, drink, and watch the parade turn into the dog show turn into football turn into more football turn into a Christmas movie turn into your dad snoring over, like, The Godfather.\n\nGiven all of this, imagine what it\u2019d be like turning on the television to watch Thanksgiving football and realizing that you\u2019re personally being made fun of by one of the players, and that your family and everybody else around the country is watching that player make fun of you? It\u2019d probably be pretty bad. Luckily, most of us never have to worry about this situation\u2014although I do look forward to a player scoring a touchdown and lifting up his jersey to reveal, \u201cHEY, STEVE J. FROM OMAHA, YOU\u2019RE UGLY\u201d written on his undershirt. Then again, most of us are not Markelle Fultz, the player the Philadelphia 76ers took with the first overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft.\n\nAfter scoring the first of his two touchdowns Thursday, Cowboys receiver Amari Cooper took the ball and pretended to shoot a free throw.\n\nAmari Cooper scores the TD and the free throw is good! pic.twitter.com/4CfJ8AKn8z \u2014 DraftKings (@DraftKings) November 22, 2018\n\nAt first I was unimpressed: Players have celebrated touchdowns with fake free throws before. Yet as the celebration was replayed, I couldn\u2019t stop looking at Cooper\u2019s form. It felt so rushed and herky-jerky; in fact, Cooper barely pretended to care in which direction his fake shot went. Why would Cooper choose to perform a free throw\u2013shooting celebration if he doesn\u2019t know how to competently shoot a free throw?\n\nAs it turns out, Cooper probably does know how to shoot a free throw. He was making his form intentionally ridiculous-looking as an homage to Fultz, the basketball player who has forgotten how to shoot a basketball.\n\nAs if you needed another reason to hate the Cowboys... here\u2019s Amari Cooper mocking Markelle Fultz\u2019 FT motion in a TD celebration. pic.twitter.com/4KDeg0gRvP \u2014 Eagles Nation (4-6) (@PHLEaglesNation) November 23, 2018\n\nThanks to the magic of 2018, we now have video footage of Fultz reacting to the nightmare scenario described above: Fultz made an Instagram post in which he filmed Cooper\u2019s celebration over the sounds of friends\u2019 uproarious laughter, then turned the camera on himself and balled his hand into a fist with a smile on his face:\n\nlove markelle fultz's reaction to amari cooper's post-touchdown impression of his free-throw stroke pic.twitter.com/Rd0YiDYRhK \u2014 joon (@joonlee) November 23, 2018\n\nFultz was a genuinely good shooter in college and converted more than 40 percent of his 3-point attempts at Washington. Then he got to the NBA and began to suffer some of the most baffling yips in sports history. His shot has gotten so bad that nobody knows whether it\u2019s caused by a physical injury or mental angst. He recently attempted a free throw so poorly that his former shooting coach felt compelled to instantly tell the press that they had stopped working together.\n\nAnd now things have gotten to the point that even Amari Cooper is like, \u201cWow, I can\u2019t believe Fultz isn\u2019t performing up to the level of production you\u2019d expect from a clearly talented player drafted that highly.\u201d Just brutal, sitting around to eat turkey and getting roasted more deeply than the most burnt bird in America. Somehow, this is 10,000 times worse than the harshest zings your aunt can muster about how you\u2019re still unmarried.\n\nWinner: NFL Starting Quarterbacks\n\nThe NFL\u2019s Thanksgiving games are supposed to serve as a showcase for the sport, a trio of matchups that display the best the league has to offer. Yet instead of featuring the league\u2019s best talent, Thursday\u2019s first two games shined a light on a pair of career backup QBs, as injuries forced Chicago and Washington to play passers who hadn\u2019t previously started since 2014.\n\nAfter Alex Smith went down with a gruesome season-ending injury, Colt McCoy has taken the reins under center in Washington. McCoy has been on the team\u2019s roster since 2014, backing up Robert Griffin III, Kirk Cousins, and then Smith, but hadn\u2019t actually thrown a pass in a game since 2015. On Thursday, he had to start after just three days of prep. It didn\u2019t go particularly well, as McCoy had three interceptions:\n\nWashington was in sole possession of first place in the NFC East when Smith went down. Two losses later, and it\u2019s now tied atop the division.\n\nIn the early game, Chase Daniel stepped in for usual Bears starter Mitchell Trubisky, who was dealing with a more minor injury but wasn\u2019t ready to go just four days after tweaking his shoulder in a victory against the Vikings on Sunday Night Football. Daniel, like McCoy, hadn\u2019t thrown a pass in a game in years. Yet while McCoy has backed up a rotating cast of quarterbacks in Washington, Daniel has rotated franchises, going from the Chiefs to the Eagles to the Saints before landing with the Bears. When he finally got a chance to play, he held his own: Chicago beat the Lions 23-16, and Daniel threw two touchdowns and zero interceptions.\n\nBut Daniel\u2019s 6.2 yards-per-attempt average reveals that he wasn\u2019t doing a whole lot. He wasn\u2019t able to contribute to the running game in the way Trubisky can, and missed some throws that good quarterbacks make:\n\nDaniel got the win, by which I mean that he played well enough for the Chicago defense to score a game-winning touchdown. Still, as somebody who\u2019s often wondered how good Trubisky is, I came away with a reminder that he remains on the short list of humans capable of effectively playing quarterback in the NFL.\n\nDaniel and McCoy are on an even shorter list of humans: The men who have managed to stay in the NFL for a significant stretch of time without regularly playing. Both have been in the league since 2010, racking up tens of millions of dollars in career earnings despite rarely getting onto the field. There\u2019s a great hustle in pro football for the guys who can pull that off: If you don\u2019t play for long enough, never revealing how good you actually are, you can secure a reputation as a QB Who Knows the System. And if you become a QB Who Knows the System, you can be the focal point of an NFL Thanksgiving Day game.\n\nWhile neither quarterback was catastrophic on Thursday, they also showed themselves to be clear downgrades from their teams\u2019 starters. Trubisky and Smith aren\u2019t the cream of the crop, but this Thanksgiving was a reminder to be thankful for our mediocre QBs\u2014they\u2019re better than backups.\n\nLoser: Jon Gruden\n\nYou\u2019re a good family member. Even if you got too drunk at Thanksgiving and insulted the vast majority of your cousins, that statement still holds true. After all, no matter what you might have said or done, you couldn\u2019t have been as hurtful to a relative as Jon Gruden was to one of his, by trading Cooper to a team in his brother\u2019s division:\n\nAmari Cooper would not be caught!\n\n\n\n(via @NFL)pic.twitter.com/jMRPz0YRnb \u2014 Pro Football Focus (@PFF) November 23, 2018\n\nCooper torched Jay Gruden\u2019s Washington defense to the tune of 180 receiving yards and two touchdowns. If there was a Thanksgiving NFL MVP award, he and Brees would be the top candidates. When the Cooper trade was completed in late October, it was generally considered a bad deal for Dallas: Cooper had underwhelmed at the end of his Oakland tenure, and the Cowboys gave up a first-round pick to nab him. That seemed like a colossal overpay considering the Eagles got Golden Tate for a third-rounder and the Patriots got Josh Gordon for a fifth.\n\nBut Cooper won Dallas the game Thursday, giving the Cowboys a share of the division lead behind a pair of spectacular plays that few other receivers could make. Jon Gruden might have gotten a great return for Cooper; the cost was potentially helping knock his brother out of the playoffs.\n\nSpeaking of players who Gruden traded and are now thriving elsewhere, Khalil Mack played for the Bears on Thursday. For the first time in a while, he didn\u2019t post huge statistics. Mack registered no sacks for just the third time all season, and no fumble recoveries for just the fourth. But if you watched the game closely, you know why: Because the Lions were triple-freakin\u2019-teaming him.\n\n.@52Mack_ loves loves loves the attention; 3 guys in some cases, opening up the OPPS for other guys to eat. What a hungry group. 34 sacks, 20 INT\u2019s, 9 fumble recoveries , 6 TD\u2019s New Monsters of the Midway. #BaldysBreakdowns pic.twitter.com/0jvoi307Vz \u2014 Brian Baldinger (@BaldyNFL) November 23, 2018\n\nWe should all be thankful for Jon Gruden. The constant comedy provided by his 2-8 Raiders would have been enough, but he also went ahead and made other NFL teams more interesting by sending them his team\u2019s best players. This holiday season, he\u2019s the gift that keeps on giving.\n\nWinner: The Bears\u2019 Shuffling Crew\n\nAfter Kyle Fuller sealed Chicago\u2019s win with a red zone interception Thursday, Prince Amukamara and his teammates began to sing and dance:\n\nBears TD celebration was better than the halftime show pic.twitter.com/zNZ08dVVYz \u2014 CJ Fogler (@cjzer0) November 22, 2018\n\nWhen I saw this, I immediately thought: \u201cOh hell yeah, they\u2019re doing the Super Bowl Shuffle!\u201d You know the \u201cSuper Bowl Shuffle\u201d: the song recorded by the 1985 Bears ahead of their Super Bowl championship. The key word there: ahead. It is painfully lo-fi, and painfully 1985. The team runs out of words to rhyme with \u201cshuffle\u201d by the sixth verse. (Backup Steve Fuller goes with the painfully agrammatical, \u201cI\u2019m not here to feathers ruffle,\u201d which is certainly not a sentence.) The video features one guy on the microphone as everyone else snaps and shuffles behind him\u2014like the Bears\u2019 dance routine. This could\u2019ve gone down as an all-time misguided moment in the history of athletes\u2019 musical decisions. Since the Bears won that Super Bowl, though, it became a classic. It even got nominated for a Grammy, losing out to Prince.\n\nFollowing Thursday\u2019s game, Amukamara explained that his celebration wasn\u2019t a shout-out to the \u201985 Bears\u2014it was a nod to Motown acts like the Temptations, since the game was in Detroit. I should\u2019ve known: No \u201985 Bear attempted any moves as snazzy as the little spin Amukamara pulls.\n\nStill, it\u2019s worth noting that so many of us thought this was an homage to the \u201cSuper Bowl Shuffle\u201d\u2014and felt that the dance was deserved. This Bears team is on a five-game win streak and appears to be a near-lock for the playoffs. It would\u2019ve been lame if one of the 5-11 or 3-13 Chicago teams of the past four years attempted this tribute. While these Bears weren\u2019t recreating the \u201cSuper Bowl Shuffle,\u201d Sunday made me realize they\u2019re good enough to do so without blaspheming their forebears.\n\nWinner: Turkey Day Beef\n\nThanksgiving isn\u2019t just the NFL\u2019s day. It\u2019s one of a few days shared by pro games and significant college matchups, as Thursday is traditionally the beginning of college football\u2019s rivalry week. That includes the Egg Bowl between Ole Miss and Mississippi State. These neighbors, like so many neighbors, hate virtually everything about each other, and got into a big brawl that resulted in one of the most beautiful penalty descriptions you\u2019ll ever hear: \u201cUnsportsmanlike conduct, on all players from both teams.\u201d\n\nThey're handing out two pieces with a biscuit at the Egg Bowl pic.twitter.com/DQPOXYCZ3g \u2014 CJ Fogler (@cjzer0) November 23, 2018\n\n\"Unsportsmanlike conduct on all players from both teams.\"\n\n\n\nThe Egg Bowl got a little heated. pic.twitter.com/APHeah1QRw \u2014 ESPN (@espn) November 23, 2018\n\nGiving an unsportsmanlike penalty to every damn player in the stadium is a somewhat common way to handle a big college ruckus, and recently led to a quarterback who wasn\u2019t even involved in a brawl getting ejected for his \u201csecond\u201d unsportsmanlike penalty of a game. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard a ref describe it like this.\n\nRivalry week is just like Thanksgiving: It\u2019s the one time each year that you are obligated to be in a room with that person you absolutely can\u2019t stand, and you let months\u2019 worth of petty remarks slip over the course of a couple of hours. Most of the time this doesn\u2019t erupt into full-out conflict, as nobody wants to make a scene. But Thursday everything boiled over and the Rebels and Bulldogs started wrestling at the dinner table. That\u2019s what great about rivalry week: Unlike most family debacles, this is nationally televised."}

The show premiered on August 8, 2012 and ended on August 14, 2014. Thompson and her family originally rose to fame on TLC's reality series Toddlers & Tiaras.[1] Ironically, the show's name comes from a taunt that Alana hurled at another pageant contestant during her debut in Toddlers and Tiaras,[2] but a sweeping misinterpretation from the general public resulted in Alana being referred to as \"Honey Boo Boo Child\" instead. The show revolves around Alana \"Honey Boo Boo\" Thompson and her family's adventures in the town of McIntyre, Georgia. The reality series received predominantly negative reviews from television critics during its run.\n\nOn October 24, 2014, TLC cancelled the series after four seasons, following rumours stating that cast member June Shannon started dating a man who was a registered sex offender, which both Shannon and her older daughter Lauryn denied. A number of episodes had already been taped for a fifth season, but went unaired until April 21, 2017, when TLC aired four of the episodes as the two-hour special Here Comes Honey Boo Boo: The Lost Episodes.\n\nCast and premise [ edit ]\n\nBesides Alana, who was six years old when the first season was filmed, the show features her stay-at-home mother June \"Mama June\" Shannon; her father Mike \"Sugar Bear\" Thompson, a chalk miner; and her three sisters: Lauryn \"Pumpkin\" Shannon, Jessica \"Chubbs\" Shannon, and Anna \"Chickadee\" Shannon (now Anna Cardwell).[3][4][5] Anna Shannon gave birth to daughter Kaitlyn Cardwell in the first-season finale.[6][7]\n\nThe first season of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo aired from August 8 to October 26, 2012, and was followed by four specials airing in early 2013.\n\nIn September 2012, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo was renewed for a second season.[8] The second season debuted July 17, 2013, and concluded on September 11, 2013. The second season featured preparations for the wedding/\"commitment ceremony\" of June Shannon and Mike Thompson. For the second-season premiere, TLC distributed \"Watch 'N' Sniff\" cards, allowing viewers to release scents correlating with specific scenes.[9]\n\nOn September 20, 2013, it was announced that TLC had ordered a twelve-episode third season and three specials.[10] The third season premiered on January 16, 2014,[11] and concluded on March 6, 2014.\n\nRatings and reception [ edit ]\n\nThe series premiere episode attained a 1.6 rating in the 18\u201349 demographic, attracting 2.2 million viewers.[12] The series was one of TLC's highest-rated shows in its first season.[13] The August 29 episode, airing on Wednesday night during the 2012 Republican National Convention, attracted almost 3 million viewers and scored a 1.3 rating among 18- to 49-year-olds, the highest rating in that age group for any cable program that night,[14] though about 20 million in all were watching the convention. Fox News convention coverage was second in the time period with a 1.2 rating, followed by NBC coverage with 1.1.[15]\n\nCritical reaction to the series has been mixed, with some characterizing the show as \"offensive\", \"outrageous\" and \"exploitative\", while others call it \"must-see TV\".[16]\n\nCriticism [ edit ]\n\nThe A.V. Club called the first episode a \"horror story posing as a reality television program\",[17] with others worrying about potential child exploitation.[18] James Poniewozik mostly praised the show, but criticized the producers for \"the way that the show seems to assume that those viewers will look at this family and the world.\"[19]\n\nA reviewer for Forbes criticized TLC as trying to \"portray Alana's family as a horde of lice-picking, lard-eating, nose-thumbing hooligans south of the Mason\u2013Dixon line\", stating that \"it falls flat, because there's no true dysfunction here, save for the beauty pageant stuff\".[20] The Guardian also criticized the attempt to portray the Thompsons as people to \"point and snicker at,\" saying, \"none of the women or girls who participate in the show seems to hate themselves for their poverty, their weight, their less-than-urbane lifestyle, or the ways in which they diverge from the socially-acceptable beauty standard.\"[21]\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter pronounced the show \"horrifying,\" explaining:\n\nYou know this show is exploitation. TLC knows it. Maybe even Mama and HBB know it, deep down in their rotund bodies. Here Comes Honey Boo Boo is a car crash, and everybody rubber-necks at a car crash, right? It's human nature. Yes, except that if you play that card, you also have to realize that human nature comes with the capacity to draw a line, to hold fast against the dehumanization and incremental tearing down of the social fabric, even if this never-ending onslaught of reality television suggests that's a losing effort. You can say no to visual exploitation. You can say no to TLC. And you can say no to Honey Boo Boo Child. Somebody has to.[22]\n\nTV Guide's \"Cheers & Jeers 2012\" issue commented, \"Jeers to Here Comes Honey Boo Boo for existing. Alana Thompson and her family have lowered the TV bar to new depths while introducing viewers to the terms 'forklift foot' and 'neck crust.' In a word, ewww.\"[23]\n\nJune Shannon herself was criticized for her daughter's diet, which included \"Go Go Juice,\" a mixture of Red Bull and Mountain Dew that contains as much caffeine as two cups of coffee. She used the blended beverage to get her daughter ready for pageants. Shannon, in responding to such criticism, pointed out, \"There are far worse things...I could be giving her alcohol.\"[1]\n\nPraise [ edit ]\n\nOut praised the show for Alana Thompson's attitude toward her gay paternal uncle Lee \"Poodle\" Thompson; Thompson stated, \"Ain't nothing wrong with bein' a little gay.\" Out noted the show's \"clear message of equality\" and said that Alana's acceptance of her gay relative \"confounded\" the stereotype of the \"redneck\" working-class, Southern white female.[24]\n\nJune Shannon has been praised by Mother Nature Network for her \"keen business sense\" with which she feeds her family on $80 a week by clipping copious coupons, playing bingo, exploiting roadkill, and acquiring child-support checks from each of her four children's fathers.[13]\n\nPrior to the show's second season, Hank Stuever of The Washington Post said the show \"feels as real to me as the Great Depression images shot by the WPA photographers\" and praised the \"solid\u2014if unorthodox\u2014family values.\"[25]\n\nParodies [ edit ]\n\nHere Comes Honey Boo Boo has been lampooned by the animated TV series South Park, in its season 16 episode \"Raising the Bar\",[26] by the animated TV series MAD, in a short called \"Here Comes Yogi Boo Boo\", and in an online spoof uploaded on CollegeHumor called \"Precious Plum.\"[27]\n\nChristopher Walken, Colin Farrell and Sam Rockwell took time from promoting their new film Seven Psychopaths to deliver a dramatic rendition of Here Comes Honey Boo Boo.[28]\n\nThe film Scary Movie 5 featured a scene parodying Sinister where Simon Rex is frightened by an Alana look-a-like that pops out of a cardboard box and says, \"A dollar makes me holla, honey boo boo child.\"\n\nIn the tenth season of competition reality show RuPaul's Drag Race, contestant Eureka O'Hara impersonated Alana during the show's recurring challenge 'Snatch Game',[29] which is, in itself, a parody of the popular show Match Game.\n\nCancellation [ edit ]\n\nOn October 24, 2014, TLC announced the cancellation of the show after reports surfaced that June Shannon was dating a man convicted of child molestation. Shannon and her older daughter Lauryn denied these reports.[30] The man in question, Mark Anthony McDaniel, Sr., was convicted of aggravated child molestation of an 8-year-old in March 2004. McDaniel is listed as a registered sex offender with the Georgia Sex Offender Registry.[30][31] Shannon's eldest daughter confirmed that she is the child who was molested by McDaniel 10 years earlier.[30][32] TLC commented on the future of the series regarding the current situation with the following statement: \"We are currently reassessing the reports, but we do not currently have Here Comes Honey Boo Boo in production\".[33]\n\nAn entire season's worth of episodes \u2013 which could reportedly fill six months of schedule[34] \u2013 are left unaired, following the cancellation of the show.[35]\n\nUpon hearing of the show's cancellation, Vivid Entertainment president Steven Hirsch sent a letter to June Shannon, offering her and her former live-in partner, Mike Thompson, US$1 million to appear in a pornographic film. Hirsch stated that the studio's BBW themed productions have become a very popular genre on Vivid.com and VividTV, and he would make the couple's experience \"enjoyable\" for them both, as well as give them creative input.[36] But June refused, explaining, \"I have more respect for myself and my kids and my family. It ain't happening, not even for a zillion dollars.\"\n\nIn February 2015, Alana and June had appeared on an episode of The Doctors after Alana had noticeably gained weight and had weighed 125 pounds (57 kg).[37]\n\nAlana had collaborated with Lauryn and Adam Barta, and the three were set to release a song called \"Movin' Up,\" but TLC had threatened to sue the Shannons, as they were not allowed to release anything until their contract expired in late May 2015.[38]\n\nJune \"Mama June\" Shannon and Mike \"Sugar Bear\" Thompson returned to reality television in 2015 as participants of Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars 4. While the couple were there to work on their marriage, Sugar Bear ultimately revealed his infidelities to June.\n\nEpisodes [ edit ]\n\nSeason 1 (2012) [ edit ]\n\nNo. in\n\nseries No. in\n\nseason Title Original air date Production code U.S. viewers\n\n(million) 1 1 \"This Is My Crazy Family\" August 8, 2012 ( ) 101 2.25[41] 2 2 \"Gonna Be a Sassy Girl\" August 8, 2012 ( ) 102 2.14[41] 3 3 \"She Oooo'd Herself\" August 15, 2012 ( ) 103 2.05[42] 4 4 \"I'm Sassified!\" August 15, 2012 ( ) 104 1.94[42] 5 5 \"What Is a Door Nut?\" August 22, 2012 ( ) 105 2.33[43] 6 6 \"A Bunch of Wedgies\" August 29, 2012 ( ) 106 2.99[44] 7 7 \"Shh!

Whether she is making a statement leaving a restaurant with wine glass in hand, or showing off her own Fenty x Puma designs, she is consistently one to watch both on and off the red carpet. Rihanna has blessed us with some insane style moments, the Met Gala being no exception. Her past Met Gala looks vary from a tailored suit in 2009, to a revealing Stella McCartney white two-piece gown in 2014. On the 2015 red carpet, Rihanna was undeniably one of the best dressed in attendance wearing a yellow Guo Pei gown with an insanely elaborate train and a matching headpiece that made headlines and may be one of the most memorable MET Gala looks of all time. In 2017, she stole the show again in Comme des Garcons. Here is a look back at Rihanna at the Gala from 2007 to 2018."}

Let's take a look back at the most intense celebrity feuds of the year.\n\n1. Blac Chyna vs. Rob Kardashian\n\nBlac Chyna and Rob Kardashian's split turned a new level of nasty when the former couple exchanged wild accusations against one another in a heated, NSFW social media war in June. Kardashian shared graphic naked photos of Chyna, accused her of cheating on him multiple times and also accused her of being on drugs. Meanwhile, Chyna took to Snapchat to accuse Kardashian of also cheating on her and being physically abusive.\n\nOne month later, a judge granted Chyna's request for a temporary restraining order against Kardashian.\n\n\"Revenge porn is a form of domestic abuse,\" Chyna's attorney, Lisa Bloom, said during a press conference.\n\nGreg Doherty/Getty Images\n\nBut the two now appear to be keeping it amicable when it comes to their daughter, 1-year-old Dream. In September, the two reached a custody agreement.\n\n\"Chyna is pleased that Rob has agreed to peacefully co-parent Dream with her, as she has been requesting all along,\" Bloom said in a statement.\n\nKardashian\u2019s attorney, Robert Shapiro, also told ET at the time that \"Rob and Chyna are working together to put the best interest of their child first and have amicably resolved their personal matters.\"\n\nOf course, Chyna is still suing Kardashian, his mom Kris Jenner and sister Kim Kardashian West over the cancellation of E!\u2019s Rob & Chyna.\n\n2. Dwayne Johnson vs. Tyrese Gibson\n\nAlberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images\n\nThe drama between the Fast and Furious co-stars began in September, when Gibson left a comment on Johnson\u2019s Instagram post, asking him not to let a rumored spinoff film starring Johnson\u2019s character, Agent Hobbs, push back the planned release date of Fast 9.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m simply trying to reach him cause he won\u2019t call me back about this solo #HobbsMovie,\u201d Gibson wrote in the lengthy comment. \u201cI want you to shoot it just not right now cause the #Fast9 release date has already been announced.\u201d\n\nThe feud escalated one month later, when Gibson called out Johnson on Instagram, and slammed his critical and commercial flop, Baywatch.\n\n\n\nJohnson defended himself on Twitter.\n\n\"My goal from day 1 was to come in and create an exciting/fun character for the fans, elevate the franchise and build it out,\" he tweeted.\n\nGibson also took to Twitter, to call his co-star \"selfish.\"\n\n\"The real selfish #CandyA** revealed,\" Gibson wrote. \"And why you on Twitter?? You lost my number right? I'm at you when I see you #Family.\"\n\n\"You still promoting a movie that no one wants to see made you clown,\" he continued.\n\nOf course, Johnson didn't take the shady tweets lying down.\n\n\"Pumped to expand and build out the FAST & FURIOUS universe in a cool, exciting way,\" Johnson captioned yet another Instagram post, adding, \"Thank you UNIVERSAL STUDIOS for being tremendous partners who see the big picture and for coming to us years ago with this spinoff idea.\"\n\n\n\n\"I have a tremendous amount of respect for this franchise that I\u2019ve enjoyed droppin\u2019 blood and sweat in over the years,\" he continued. \"And my vision is to create greater opportunities for not only my fellow FF cast mates, but for other amazing actors as well who want to be a part of something new and cool.The more opportunities we can create the better for the fans.

You are simply NOT the people\u2019s champ..... you are a selfish champ.\"\n\n3. Kanye West vs. JAY-Z\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe two close friends and collaborators' falling out continued this year, after West publicly called JAY-Z out during an onstage concert rant last November.\n\n\"You got hurt, because this guy was talking about you on a stage,\" JAY-Z commented in August during an interview with Elliott Wilson and Brian \"B.Dot\" Miller on the Rap Radar podcast. \"But what really hurt me, you can't bring my kid or my wife into it. Like, Kanye is my little brother. He's talked about me a hundred times. He even made a song called \u2018Big Brother.' We've gotten past bigger issues, but you brought my family into it, now it's a problem.\"\n\nIn July, West reportedly left JAY-Z\u2019s Tidal over a money dispute.\n\nHowever, there is hope for those wishing for a Watch the Throne part two. During a Q&A with New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet for T: The New York Times Style Magazine in November, JAY-Z had a few conciliatory words for West, whom he still referred to as his \"brother.\"\n\n\"I [talked to] Kanye the other day, just to tell him, like, he's my brother,\" he recalled. \"I love Kanye. I do. It's a complicated relationship with us.\"\n\nStill, JAY-Z admitted that there's currently tension between the two.\n\n\"But that happens,\" he stressed. \"In the long relationship, you know, hopefully when we're 89 we look at this six months or whatever time and we laugh at that. There's gonna be complications in the relationship that we have to get through. And the only way to get through that is we sit down and have a dialogue and say, 'These are the things that I'm uncomfortable with. These are the things that are unacceptable to me. This is what I feel.' I'm sure he feels that I've done things to him as well. I'm not a perfect human being by no stretch.\"\n\n\"[West is] a very compassionate person,\" he added.

And we just need to speak about it. But there's genuine love there.\"\n\n4. Camila Cabello vs. Fifth Harmony\n\nGetty Images\n\nThings turned messy between girl group Fifth Harmony and Camila Cabello pretty quickly after she announced she was leaving the group last December, and the remaining members -- Lauren Jauregui, Ally Brooke, Normani Kordei and Dinah Jane -- claimed in a statement that they only learned of her departure through her representatives.\n\nIn an interview with Billboard in February, Cabello talked about the \u201cintense\u201d split and admitted she hadn\u2019t spoken to her former bandmates.\n\n\"I was always super open [that] I couldn\u2019t just sing other people\u2019s words and be totally happy with that,\" Cabello said of exiting the group. \"You have to follow and honor that inner voice. I always encouraged the girls to do the same.\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t want to get into the details of that, because it was really intense and it\u2019s hard for me to talk about,\" she added about not keeping in touch. \"It makes me sad.\"\n\nIn their own Billboard interview in July, Fifth Harmony wasn\u2019t shy about alluding to the bad blood.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say we\u2019re in a better place now -- there are no secrets in this circle,\u201d Jane said of Cabello's exit.\n\nHowever, the shadiest moment definitely happened at the MTV Video Music Awards in August, when before their performance of \"Angel\" and \"Down,\" a a fifth member of the group -- presumably meant to represent Cabello -- fell backwards off the stage.\n\nThe group later denied they were slamming Cabello during an interview with Good Morning America.\n\n\u201cWe get asked all the time if we\u2019re getting a fifth member,\u201d Brooke explained. \u201cAnd we wanted to show the world in an artistic way that, \u2018Hey, the four of us are Fifth Harmony. We are stronger and better than we\u2019ve ever been.\"\n\n5. Kim Cattrall vs. Sex and the City Cast\n\nNew Line Cinema\n\nRumors have floated around for some time now that Kim Cattrall didn't get along with her Sex and the City cast members, and they were pretty much confirmed this year, after Sarah Jessica Parker announced that there would be no Sex and the City 3 film.\n\n\"It's over... we're not doing it,\" she told Extra. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed. We had this beautiful, funny, heartbreaking, joyful, very relatable script and story. It\u2019s not just disappointing that we don\u2019t get to tell the story and have that experience, but more so for that audience that has been so vocal in wanting another movie.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Mail later reported that it was Cattrall's \"demands\" that put a stop to the project, claiming she insisted that Warner Bros. produce other movies she had in development before signing onto SATC 3. Cattrall denied the report on Twitter.\n\nWoke 2 a @MailOnline \ud83d\udca9storm! The only 'DEMAND' I ever made was that I didn't want to do a 3rd film....& that was back in 2016 \u2014 Kim Cattrall (@KimCattrall) September 29, 2017\n\nCattrall then specifically called out Parker during an interview with Piers Morgan for ITV's Life Stories.\n\n\"At this very moment, it\u2019s quite extraordinary to get any kind of negative press about something that I\u2019ve been saying for almost a year,\" she noted. \"This is really where I take to task the people from Sex and the City, specifically Sarah Jessica Parker, in that I think she could have been nicer,\" she expressed to Morgan. \"I really think she could have been nicer.\"\n\n\"I don\u2019t know what her issue is, I never have,\" she added.\n\nCattrall also said she was never friends with her SATC co-stars, including Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis.\n\n\"We\u2018ve been colleagues and in some ways, it\u2019s a very healthy place to be because then you have a clear line between your professional life and relationship and your personal,\" she noted. \"They all have children and I am 10 years older, and since, specifically, the series ended, I have been spending most of my time outside of New York, so, I don\u2019t see them. The common ground that we had was the series, and the series is over.\"\n\nThough she did admit that she wishes her co-stars would try harder to keep in touch, after sharing that she couldn't even recall the last time she had spoken to them.\n\n\"That\u2019s another thing that\u2019s really disappointing, is that nobody ever picks up the phone and tries to contact you and say, \u2018How you doing?\u2019\" she shared.\n\n\u2026. And it appears the cast is taking sides. Willie Garson -- who portrayed Stanford Blatch, the best friend of Carrie Bradshaw (Parker) in both the TV series and the movies -- posted a cryptic tweet in October that appeared to be aimed at Cattrall. Cattrall repeatedly denied that she ever considered doing a third SATC movie and further claimed that she never began contract negotiations.\n\n\"Dear fans, because I'm \"toxic,\" I'm going to negotiate a contract for 6 months, not come to terms, then say I never wanted to do it anyway,'\" he wrote.\n\nDear fans, because I'm \"toxic\", I'm going to negotiate a contract for 6 months, not come to terms, then say I never wanted to do it anyway. \u2014 Willie Garson (@WillieGarson) October 4, 2017\n\n6. Katy Perry vs. Taylor Swift\n\n\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe epic Katy Perry vs. Taylor Swift feud continued with the promotion of both their respective albums this year -- Perry's Witness and Swift's Reputation. Perry didn't hold back during her Carpool Karaoke segment with James Corden in June, addressing the beef head-on.\n\n\"Honestly, it's really like she started it and it's time for her to finish it,\" Perry said after the Late Late Show host asked her to clear things up. \"She wouldn't speak to me. I do the right thing any time that it feels like a fumble. It was a full shutdown and then she writes a song about me and I'm like, 'OK, cool, cool, cool. That's how you wanna deal with it?'\"\n\nIn an interview with NME, Perry gave background on why she decided to address the feud with Corden.\n\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019m not Buddha -- things irritate me,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish that I could turn the other cheek every single time, but I\u2019m also not a pushover, you know? Especially when someone tries to assassinate my character with little girls [her fans]. That\u2019s so messed up!\u201d\n\nThough Swift stayed silent on Perry's comments about her, she let her actions do the talking. Swift surprisingly announced on June 8 that her entire catalog will return to all streaming services at midnight -- just when Perry's Witness dropped.\n\nSwift also took thinly veiled digs at Perry in her \"Look What You Made Me Do\" music video that dropped in August. Swift dresses up very similar to Perry in the shade-filled video and gets into a car crash -- a moment that looks very close to the accident in Perry's \"Unconditionally\" music video. She also pointedly holds a GRAMMY, highlighting that she has 10 accolades, while Perry has zero.\n\nLater, Swift is in a vault, robbing a bank and wearing a sweatshirt that features a glittery tiger, along with a cat mask, seemingly mocking the name of Perry's fanbase, KatyCats.\n\nYouTube\n\n7. Caitlyn Jenner vs. The Kardashians\n\nGetty Images\n\nCaitlyn Jenner's relationship with the Kardashian family deteriorated after the August release of her memoir, The Secret of My Life, which didn't exactly paint the Kardashians in a positive light. Kris Jenner claimed on Keeping Up With the Kardashians that Caitlyn's stories about her were \"all made up.\"\n\n\"My mom has been so fair to Cait, and Cait just has no decency towards my mom whatsoever,\" Kim Kardashian West later told KUWTK cameras, clearly siding with her mother. \"I feel like my mom is carrying this burden and feeling like she had to maintain a relationship with Caitlyn for all the kids. But we're grown up. I don't think my mom has to try anymore. It's time to move on.\"\n\nIn September, Caitlyn said she hadn't spoken to Kris or Kim since the book's release.\n\n\u201cI went overboard to be nice, to be friendly, to be open, but also tell my story and my side of the story,\u201d Caitlyn said during an appearance on Good Morning Britain. \u201cSince the book came out, I\u2019ve never talked to Kris again. Kim, I haven\u2019t talked to in six, nine months, whatever it is.\u201d\n\n\"It\u2019s unfortunate, because actually Kim was the first one I talked to about this issue,\u201d she continued. \"She was very straightforward with me. She\u2019s been very, very good on it. It\u2019s a big loss in my life, not having her there anymore. To me, I mean, that\u2019s sad.\"\n\nCurrently, the relationship is showing no signs of repair.\n\nThe I Am Cait star spoke to students at Cambridge Union in England in November, where amid discussing her 2015 transition and its aftermath, she revealed that she and Kim haven't spoken in \"a year.\"\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a little bit tough over the last couple of years on the Kardashian side,\" Caitlyn acknowledged. \"To be honest, I don't talk to them anymore. Kim, I haven't talked to in a year.\"\n\n\"They don't want me in their lives, they bashed me pretty badly,\" she continued. \"It's devastating when your kids do that. It really hurt.\"\n\n8. Drake Bell vs. Josh Peck\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe state of the Drake & Josh co-stars' friendship made headlines in June, when Bell made it clear he was upset that he wasn't invited to Peck's wedding to Paige O'Brien. Although Bell wasn't present at the ceremony, Peck's Grandfathered co-star, John Stamos, was, as well as Jason Nash, whom Peck also acted with on Drake & Josh.\n\nIn now deleted tweets, Bell made his feelings known.\n\n\"When you're not invited to the wedding the message is clear\u2026\" Bell tweeted. \"Loyalty is key\u2026 ALWAYS remember where you came from.\"\n\n\"True colors have come out today,\" he added. \"Message is loud and clear. Ties are officially cut. I'll miss ya brotha.\"\n\nFor his part, Peck made it clear that he no longer had a close relationship with Bell during his appearance on the Allegedly with Theo Von & Matthew Cole Weiss podcast.\n\nET spoke to Bell in July, when he explained the emotional tweets.\n\n\"We've been together 18 years, Josh and me, me and Josh,\" Bell shared. \"We've been so close, it was just one of those things where, you know, I'd been talking to him, and he's been telling me about the engagement. And then I saw on social media, the wedding, and I didn't hear about it. So, it was just one of those things where it was just like, 'You didn't even tell me?! I had to find out on social media?' And then you're like, 'You know what!? Fine!' and then I'm like, wait, I probably shouldn't have done that.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I said the ties are cut or whatever, but I should have just texted that to him, you know,\" he continued. \"I was just being cranky.\"\n\nTo solidify that the two had no hard feelings, they later reunited at the MTV VMAs in August.\n\n9. Justin Bieber vs. Marilyn Manson\n\n\n\nMatt Winkelmeyer, Kevin Mazur/Getty Images\n\nOne of the most bizarre feuds of the year was between pop star Justin Bieber and goth rocker Marilyn Manson. During an interview with Billboard in September, Manson said he confronted Bieber at a bar when he saw that the \"Sorry\" singer was selling shirts with Manson's face on the front and Bieber's name on the back, as part of his official Purpose World Tour merchandise.\n\n\"I saw a little girl in a pink hoodie with blond hair, and it turns out to be Bieber. I sit down, and I say, 'Hey, so you wore my shirt and everything onstage,'\" Manson recalled. \"He was one of those touchy people that hit you when they talk, and he comes up to about d**k height. Then he goes, 'I made you relevant again.'\"\n\nManson said he got revenge by not showing up to a planned duet between the two at Bieber\u2019s show that he suggested.\n\n\"I reply, 'That was a great idea you had about doing [my song] 'The Beautiful People' at your show at Staples Center tomorrow.' And he goes, 'Yeah, it was,' not knowing that I told him an idea that I had just made up,\" Manson shared. \"His tour manager sat down, and I asked, 'What time is sound check tomorrow? What time should I be there? Because we\u2019re going to do 'Beautiful People.\u2019 Obviously, when 4 p.m. rolled around the next day, I just didn't show.\"\n\nManson later claimed Bieber apologized to him through text during Manson\u2019s appearance on Howard Stern's Sirius XM show.\n\nQuoting Bieber\u2019s supposed texts, Manson read, \u201cHonestly, I totally thought we hit it off. My bad. If I was an a**hole, it wasn't my intention.\u201d\n\n\"I don't really care about the media,\" Manson continued to read from Bieber's supposed texts. \"I just wanna make sure you and I were good. \u2018Cause I like you.\"\n\nManson further reflected on their feud.\n\n\"He sassed me and he apologized,\" Manson explained. \"And I said I wouldn't s**t talk him, so I wouldn't s**t talk him.\"\n\n"}

The former couple experienced a brief break up in 2012 when the actress was caught cheating with her \u201cSnow White and the Huntsman\u201d director Rupert Sanders. Although the actors tried to work past the scandal, their relationship officially ended in 2013.\n\nA new report published by OK! claims Stewart is \u201con the rocks\u201d with her current girlfriend, Stella Maxwell, and has been spending time with her ex-boyfriend.\n\n\u201cKristen is angling to give things between them another go.

The actor began dating British singer FKA Twigs in 2014. The two were briefly engaged before news of their break up began to surface in 2017.\n\nTowards the end of that year, Pattinson was accompanied by a mystery woman to Seth MacFarlane\u2019s annual holiday party. At the time, sources told Us Weekly the two didn\u2019t attempt to hide they were together and held hands throughout the night.\n\nMeanwhile, Stewart has been in a relationship with Maxwell since December 2016. The two were most recently photographed enjoying a cozy date night on March 21 in Los Angeles.\n\nWhile fans of Pattinson and Stewart are still hoping the pair will get back together, it looks like the exes have their sights set on other people.\n\nPhoto: Jason Merritt/Getty Images"}

For the song in the musical, see Pretty Women\n\nNot to be confused with Pretty Lady (disambiguation)\n\nPretty Woman is a 1990 American romantic comedy film directed by Garry Marshall from a screenplay by J. F. Lawton. The film stars Richard Gere and Julia Roberts, and features Hector Elizondo, Ralph Bellamy (in his final performance), Laura San Giacomo, and Jason Alexander in supporting roles.[1] The film's story centers on down-on-her-luck Hollywood prostitute Vivian Ward, who is hired by Edward Lewis, a wealthy businessman, to be his escort for several business and social functions, and their developing relationship over the course of her week-long stay with him.\n\nOriginally intended to be a dark cautionary tale about class and sex work in Los Angeles, the film was reconceived as a romantic comedy with a large budget. It was widely successful at the box office and was the third highest-grossing film of 1990. The film saw the highest number of ticket sales in the U.S. ever for a romantic comedy,[2] with Box Office Mojo listing it as the #1 romantic comedy by the highest estimated domestic tickets sold at 42,176,400, slightly ahead of My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002) at 41,419,500 tickets.[3] The film received positive reviews, with Roberts's performance being praised, for which she received a Golden Globe Award and a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. In addition, screenwriter J. F. Lawton was nominated for a Writers Guild Award and a BAFTA Award.\n\nPlot [ edit ]\n\nHigh-powered businessman Edward Lewis has broken up with his girlfriend after an unpleasant phone call wherein he asked her to escort him during his business trip - she is offended that he treats her as his \"beck and call girl\". Edward is a corporate raider, who buys companies that are in financial trouble and tears down the company piece by piece. Leaving a business party in the Hollywood Hills, he takes his lawyer's Lotus Esprit sports car, and accidentally ends up on Hollywood Boulevard in the city's red-light district, where he encounters prostitute Vivian Ward. Having difficulties driving the car, he asks her to get in and guide him to the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel, where he is staying. It becomes clear that Vivian knows more about the Lotus than he does, and he lets her drive. Vivian charges Lewis $20 for the ride, and they separate. She goes to a bus stop, where he finds her and offers to hire her for the night; later, he asks Vivian to play the role his girlfriend has refused, offering her $3,000 to stay with him for the next six days as well as paying for a new, more acceptable wardrobe for her. That evening, visibly moved by her transformation, Edward begins seeing Vivian in a different light. He begins to open up to her, revealing his personal and business lives.\n\nEdward takes Vivian to a polo match in hopes of networking for his business deal. His attorney, Phillip, suspects Vivian is a corporate spy, and Edward tells him how they truly met. Phillip later approaches Vivian, suggesting they do business once her work with Edward is finished. Insulted, and furious that Edward has revealed their secret, Vivian wants to end the arrangement. Edward apologizes, and admits to feeling jealous of a business associate to whom Vivian paid attention at the match. Vivian's straightforward personality is rubbing off on Edward, and he finds himself acting in unaccustomed ways. Clearly growing involved, Edward takes Vivian by private jet to see La Traviata at the San Francisco Opera. Vivian is moved to tears by the story of the prostitute who falls in love with a rich man. Vivian breaks her \"no kissing on the mouth\" rule (which her friend Kit taught her) and they have sex; in the aftermath, Vivian tells Edward she loves him, but he does not respond. Edward offers to put her up in an apartment so she can be off the streets. Hurt, she refuses, says this is not the \"fairy tale\" she dreamed of as a child, in which a knight on a white horse rescues her.\n\nMeeting with the tycoon whose shipbuilding company he is in the process of \"raiding,\" Edward changes his mind. His time with Vivian has shown him a different way of looking at life, and he suggests working together to save the company rather than tearing it apart and selling off the pieces. Phillip, furious at losing so much money, goes to the hotel to confront Edward, but finds only Vivian. Blaming her for the change in Edward, he attempts to rape her. Edward arrives, wrestles Philip off her, punches him in the face and throws him out of the room.\n\nWith his business in L.A. complete, Edward asks Vivian to stay one more night with him, but because she wants to, not because he's paying her. She refuses. Edward re-thinks his life and has the hotel chauffeur detour to Vivian's apartment building, where he leaps from out the white limousine's sun roof and \"rescues her.\" Edward asks, \"So what happens after he climbed up the tower and rescues her?\" to which Vivian responds, \"She rescues him right back.\"\n\nCast [ edit ]\n\nProduction [ edit ]\n\nDevelopment [ edit ]\n\nThe film was initially conceived as a dark drama about sex work in Los Angeles in the 1980s.[4] The relationship between Vivian and Edward also originally involved controversial themes, including Vivian being addicted to drugs; part of the deal was that she had to stay off cocaine for a week. Edward eventually throws her out of his car and drives off. The original script by J.F. Lawton, called 3000,[5] ended with Vivian and her sex-worker friend on the bus to Disneyland.[4] Producer Laura Ziskin considered these elements detrimental to a sympathetic portrayal of Vivian, and they were removed or assigned to Kit. The deleted scenes have been found, and some were included on the DVD released for the film's 15th anniversary.[4] In one, Vivian tells Edward, \"I could just pop ya good and be on my way\", indicating her disinterest in \"pillow talk\". In another, she is confronted by drug dealers, then rescued by Edward.\n\nThough inspired by such films as Wall Street and The Last Detail,[5] the film bears a resemblance to Pygmalion myths: particularly George Bernard Shaw's play of the same name, which also formed the basis for the Broadway musical My Fair Lady. It was Walt Disney Studios then-president Jeffrey Katzenberg who insisted the film be re-written as a modern-day fairy tale and love story, as opposed to the original dark drama. It was pitched to Touchstone Pictures and re-written as a romantic comedy.[6] The title 3000 was changed because Disney executives thought it sounded like a title for a science fiction film.[7]\n\nThe film is one of two movies that triggered a resurgence of romantic comedy in Hollywood, the other being When Harry Met Sally. Following this film's success, Roberts became the romantic comedy queen of the 1990s.\n\nCasting [ edit ]\n\nCasting of the film was a rather lengthy process. Marshall had initially considered Christopher Reeve, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Denzel Washington for the role of Edward, and Al Pacino and Burt Reynolds turned it down.[8] Pacino went as far as doing a casting reading with Roberts before rejecting the part.[9] Gere initially refused but when he met with Roberts, she persuaded him and he eventually agreed to play Lewis.[10] He reportedly started off much more active in his role; but Garry Marshall took him aside and said \"No, no, no, Richard. In this movie, one of you moves and one of you does not. Guess which one you are?\"[11] Julia Roberts was not the first choice for the role of Vivian, and was not wanted by Disney. Many other actresses were considered. Marshall originally envisioned Karen Allen for the role; when she declined, auditions went to many better-known actresses of the time including Molly Ringwald,[12] who turned it down because she felt uncomfortable playing a sex worker.[citation needed] Winona Ryder auditioned, but was turned down because Marshall felt she was \"too young\". Jennifer Connelly was also dismissed for the same reason.[4]\n\nMeg Ryan, who was a top choice of Marshall's, turned it down as well. According to a note written by Marshall, Mary Steenburgen was also among the first choices. Diane Lane came very close to being cast (the script was much darker at the time); they had gone as far as costume fittings, but due to scheduling conflicts she could not accept. Michelle Pfeiffer turned the role down, saying she did not like the script's \"tone.\"[13] Daryl Hannah was also considered, but believed the role was \"degrading to women\".[13] Valeria Golino declined, doubting it would work with her thick Italian accent.[citation needed] And Jennifer Jason Leigh had auditioned.[14] When all the other actresses turned down the role, 21-year-old Julia Roberts, a relative unknown, with only the sleeper hit Mystic Pizza (1988) and the yet-to-be-released Steel Magnolias (1989) to her credit, won the role of Vivian. Her performance made her a star. J.F. Lawton, writer of the original screenplay, has suggested that the film was ultimately given a happy ending because of the chemistry of Gere and Roberts.[5]\n\nVeteran actor Ralph Bellamy, who plays James Morse, appears in his final acting performance before his death in 1991.\n\nFilming [ edit ]\n\nThe film's budget was substantial, at $14 million, so producers could shoot in many locations.[4] Most filming took place in Los Angeles, California, specifically in Beverly Hills, and inside soundstages at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank. The escargot restaurant the \"Voltaire\" was shot at the restaurant \"Rex,\" now called \"Cicada\". Scenes set in the Beverly Wilshire Hotel lobby were shot at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. Filming commenced on July 24, 1989, but was immediately plagued by problems. These included Ferrari and Porsche declining the product placement opportunity for the car Edward drove, neither firm wishing to be associated with sex workers.[4] Lotus Cars saw the placement value, and supplied a Silver 1989.5 Esprit SE (which was later sold).[15]\n\nShooting was a generally pleasant, easy-going experience, as the budget was broad and the shooting schedule was not tight.[4] While shooting the scene where Vivian is lying down on the floor of Edward's penthouse, watching reruns of I Love Lucy, Garry Marshall had to tickle Roberts' feet (out of camera range) to get her to laugh. The scene in which Gere playfully snaps the lid of a jewelry case on her fingers was improvised, and her surprised laugh was genuine. The red dress Vivian wears to the opera has been listed among the most unforgettable dresses of all time.[16]\n\nDuring the scene in which Roberts sang to a Prince song in the bathtub, slid down and submerged her head under the bubbles; she emerged to find the crew had left except for the cameraman, who captured the moment on film. In the love scene, she was so stressed that a vein become noticeable on her forehead and had to be massaged by Marshall and Gere. She also developed a case of hives, and calamine lotion was used to soothe her skin until filming resumed.[4] The filming was completed on October 18.\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nBox office [ edit ]\n\nIn its opening weekend, the film was at number one at the box office, grossing $11,280,591 and averaging $8,513 per theater.[17] Despite dropping to number two in its second weekend, it grossed more with $12,471,670.[17] It was number one at the box office for four non-consecutive weeks, and in the Top 10 for 16 weeks.[17] It has grossed $178,406,268 in the United States and $285,000,000 in other countries for a total worldwide gross of $463,406,268.[18] It was also the fourth highest-grossing film of the year in the United States[19] and the third highest-grossing worldwide.[20] The film remains Disney's highest-grossing R-rated release ever.[21]\n\nCritical response [ edit ]\n\nThe film received mixed to positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 61% of 57 film critics have given it a positive review, with a rating average of 5.7 out of 10. The site's consensus states, \"Pretty Woman may be a yuppie fantasy, but the film's slick comedy, soundtrack, and casting can overcome misgivings.\"[22] Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives it a score of 51 based on 17 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\"[23]\n\nOwen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a D, saying it \"starts out as a neo-Pygmalion comedy\" and with \"its tough-hooker heroine, it can work as a feminist version of an upscale princess fantasy.\" Gleiberman also said it \"pretends to be about how love transcends money,\" but \"is really obsessed with status symbols.\"[24] On its twentieth anniversary, Gleiberman wrote another article, saying that while he felt he was right, he would have given it a B today.[25] Carina Chocano of The New York Times said the movie \"wasn't a love story, it was a money story. Its logic depended on a disconnect between character and narrative, between image and meaning, between money and value, and that made it not cluelessly traditional but thoroughly postmodern.\"[26]\n\nAccolades [ edit ]\n\nAwards\n\nNominations\n\nMusic [ edit ]\n\nThe film is noted for its musical selections. The hugely successful soundtrack features the song \"Oh, Pretty Woman\" by Roy Orbison, which inspired its title. Roxette's \"It Must Have Been Love\" reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in June 1990. The soundtrack also features \"King of Wishful Thinking\" by Go West, \"Show Me Your Soul\" by Red Hot Chili Peppers, \"No Explanation\" by Peter Cetera, \"Wild Women Do\" by Natalie Cole and \"Fallen\" by Lauren Wood. The soundtrack went on to be certified triple platinum by the RIAA.[27]\n\nThe opera featured in the film is La Traviata, which also served as inspiration for its plot. The highly dramatic aria fragment that is repeated is the end of \"Dammi tu forza!\" (\"Give me strength!\"), from the opera. The piano piece Gere's character plays in the hotel lobby was actually composed by and performed by him. Roberts sings the song \"Kiss\" by Prince while she is in the tub and Gere's character is on the phone. Background music is composed by James Newton Howard. Entitled \"He Sleeps/Love Theme\", this piano composition is inspired by Bruce Springsteen's \"Racing in the Street\".\n\nSoundtrack [ edit ]\n\nPretty Woman Soundtrack album by Various artists Released March 13, 1990 Recorded 1964, 1988\u20131989 Genre Pop\n\nRock Length 43 : 36 Label EMI Producer Various artists Singles from Pretty Woman\n\nReleased: February 14, 1990\n\nReleased: 1990\n\nReleased: 20 May 1990\n\nProfessional ratings Review scores Source Rating AllMusic link\n\nThe soundtrack was released on March 13, 1990 by EMI.[28][29]\n\nTrack listing [ edit ]\n\nCertifications [ edit ]\n\nRegion Certification Certified units/Sales Canada (Music Canada)[30] 5\u00d7 Platinum 500,000^ Sweden (GLF)[31] Gold 50,000^ Switzerland (IFPI Switzerland)[32] Platinum 50,000^ United Kingdom (BPI)[33] 2\u00d7 Platinum 600,000^ *sales figures based on certification alone\n\n^shipments figures based on certification alone\n\n\n\nMusical adaptation [ edit ]\n\nA stage musical adaptation of the film opened on Broadway on July 20, 2018 in previews, officially on August 16 at the Nederlander Theatre.[34] This follows an out-of-town tryout at the Oriental Theatre in Chicago, which will run from March 13 to April 15, 2018.

{"label": false, "txt": "Ever since The Crown bowed on Netflix, fans have been wondering how long it will take the sumptuous period drama to reach the ill-fated marriage of Prince Charles and Diana. Because the show\u2019s first season, which starred Claire Foy as Queen Elizabeth II, spanned 1947 and 1955, viewers worried that it would take at least three or four more seasons until the drama catches up to Charles and Diana\u2019s 1977 meeting, 1981 wedding, and subsequent marriage. But series creator and writer Peter Morgan has revealed that The Crown will tackle the monarchy-marriage drama sooner than expected.\n\nPrincess Diana will be introduced toward the end of Season 3, Morgan confirms in a new interview with People, with Seasons 4 and 5 \u201cheavily\u201d focused on her as one of the main characters. To facilitate the time jump, the series will recast the major roles with older actors who can better portray Elizabeth, Philip, Charles, etc. as they age.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how The Crown, which is very much Team Monarchy, approaches the relationship, which began somewhat informally in 1977 when Charles and Diana met through her sister, whom Charles was dating at the time. When Diana became a princess, the world largely sympathized with her\u2014a deft manipulator of her public image\u2014as opposed to her less-photogenic and less P.R.-savvy husband. But Morgan will likely offer a new, Charles-sympathetic perspective to the royal marriage. In The Queen, for example, Morgan depicted Charles as a responsible and caring father frustrated by the old-fashioned, out-of-touch constraints dictated by the monarchy. And he depicted Diana, at least through Queen Elizabeth\u2019s eyes, as a drama-stirring, attention-hogging, trouble-making headache to the family.\n\nBefore getting to Diana, though, Morgan and Co. are busily filming the show\u2019s second season, which will debut in late 2017 and, according to People, \u201cfeature a greater emphasis on the life of Elizabeth\u2019s husband Prince Philip and introduce a greater role for her oldest son and direct heir, Prince Charles.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe start to focus on Charles as a young boy and his education, and on Philip and his backstory,\u201d Morgan told the magazine. Executive producer Suzanne Mackie added, \u201cWe glance backward to Philip\u2019s childhood and his upbringing, and how that might have impacted him as a man, a father and as Prince Consort\u2014which is fascinating.\u201d\n\nThe new series, which will be set from 1957 through 1964, will also show the monarchy continue to struggle in an evolving world.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s goodbye to a different, Edwardian, post-Imperial world,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cWe get a classlessness and a modernity beginning to creep in. It is going to be terrific.\u201d\n\nWhile speaking with The Crown\u2019s Vanessa Kirby earlier this year, the British actress also offered us some second-season clues about her own character, Princess Margaret, whose tragic romance with Peter Townsend was depicted in the show\u2019s first season.\n\n\u201cShe meets [the photographer and her eventual husband] Antony Armstrong-Jones, and she goes head first into a completely new, exciting, dangerous, volatile, dysfunctional relationship and then marriage,\u201d Kirby told us of Margaret, who had a reputation for rubbing elbows with the movie stars and musicians of the era.\n\n\u201cTony starts this whole trail of a more bohemian life outside,\u201d Kirby said. \u201cMargaret was best friends with Elizabeth Taylor, and she had loads of American actress friends and singers. You see these two worlds collide\u2014hers and Tony\u2019s, who is a member of the public and was a creative, liberal, dark horse. Meanwhile she is this epitome of the establishment. I\u2019ve been doing tons of research about it recently, and seen people say there was never such an ill-fated match because Margaret and Tony were just so alike personality-wise that he was the opposite of Peter.\u201d\n\nTo read the rest of the interview with Kirby, click here.\n\nGet Vanity Fair\u2019s HWD Newsletter Sign up for essential industry and award news from Hollywood.

{"label": false, "txt": "In 2007, an L.A. family's unvarnished docuseries launched on E!, and reality television, female body image, social media and, above all, the economy of celebrity were forever changed. Now the stars and producers of the megafranchise (nine TV spinoffs, hundreds of millions of dollars earned) reveal the secrets of its improbable explosion into the zeitgeist.\n\nWearing curve-hugging black workout pants and a white tank top, Kim Kardashian perches on a couch in the media room of her newly renovated Bel Air estate and sips Pedialyte through a straw. The makeup-free 36-year-old appears almost normal \u2014 certainly not like a mogul who, according to Forbes, banked $45.5 million the past year from a brand she built on self-\u00adaggrandizement, shameless product peddling and nude selfies. At the epicenter of this unprecedented trajectory remains E!'s Keeping Up With the Kardashians, a living record of her happily debauched family \u2014 Kourtney, 38; Khloe, 33; Rob, 30; Kendall, 21; and Kylie, 20; as well as matriarch Kris, 61, and her ex Caitlyn Jenner, 67 (who in 2015 transitioned from Bruce). On Sept. 24, a 90-minute special will celebrate the series' 10th unapologetic year. It's a head-scratching milestone for a show that, at its conception, offered viewers little more than a voyeuristic lens into the lives of a celebrity-adjacent family \u2014 but quickly became the mother ship for all their product extensions and the platform through which Kris and her five daughters ushered in the era of the reality celebrity as a brand.\n\nKeeping Up With the Kardashians now airs in 167 countries, boasts nine spinoffs to date and has ranked as E! Entertainment's top-rated series since 2010. And while it peaked in 2011 with 10.5 million viewers over two nights for Kim's fairy-tale wedding to Kris Humphries (they divorced after 72 days), it still averages north of 2.1 million every Sunday in its 13th season. In 2015, E! agreed to a reported $80 million deal to keep the family through season 14. But that's a pittance compared to the fashion and lifestyle empire they've built from one boutique in the Valley. With a combined social media reach of 700 million-plus followers and five insanely profitable apps, the family mints millions from a hodgepodge of endorsement deals, paid appearances and can't-stay-in-stock products. And it all grew from a show that opened its pilot with these prophetic words from Kim (already notorious for the sex tape she made with her ex, Ray J, that was made public in 2007): \"I hate you all.\"\n\nAs much as the family reveals on the show, on red carpets and on Instagram, one mystery remains. How the hell did this happen?\n\nKris Jenner (star, executive producer) Before the show, I was managing Bruce's speaking career and personal appearances.\n\nKim Kardashian (star, executive producer) I was going to [Pierce College], and after school I would go work the cash register at our store, Dash. This all happened when I was 27 \u2026\n\nKendall Jenner (star) That's so crazy because I'm not even 27. We've lived the same amount of time of the same thing, but I'm not even the age you were when you started.\n\nRyan Seacrest (executive producer) Everyone was talking about The Osbournes, and I said to my development executive Eliot [Goldberg], \"Let's try to find something in this world and take it to E!\"\n\nKris One night, Deena Katz [casting director for Dancing With the Stars] came over for dinner and life was swirling around, and she said, \"This is a reality show \u2014 I think you should really talk to Ryan Seacrest.\" So I did.\n\nSeacrest Kris told me what she envisioned, and I said, \"Let's send a crew to your house and tape some stuff and then we'll take a look at it.\" Then I realized I didn't have a crew; I didn't even have a camera. I had Eliot buy a camera, and he went and shot them. He called me after and said, \"I think we have something special.\"\n\nKourtney Kardashian (star, executive producer) We had talked to producers about doing a show about the three of us running the store, Dash, where Khloe and I would do the day-to-day, and Kim would come in as a stylist. It didn't go anywhere.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nIn Caitlyn Jenner's memoir, The Secrets of My Life, released earlier this year, she implies that the series may actually have been her brainchild. She writes, \"The house is awash in puberty and adolescence and young adulthood and two parents with very different styles. It seems to me something is there for television. \u2026 Kris says she is the one who came up with the idea \u2026\" Jenner declined to participate in this story.\n\nKris It's so absurd. I'm not sure what the motivation was for her to say something like that. Maybe somebody should remind her that it's called Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\n\nTed Harbert (then-CEO of E! Networks) Just like anybody else, I knew of the family through [O.J. Simpson attorney] Robert Kardashian. There was a bit of the stuff with Kim hanging around Paris Hilton and, of course, the fun with Ray J [who made a sex tape with Kim]. That was sort of world news.\n\nDamla Dogan (senior vp development & programming, E!) They were just crossing over into pop culture territory, especially Kim. She had a look that wasn't on TV at the time. She wasn't stick thin, and that was relatable.\n\nSeacrest We pitched it to E!, and initially they passed. I called Ted and said, \"This is a special show, and I want you to know we brought it to you [first].\" I was going to take it to Bravo.\n\nHarbert Ryan asked me to take a look at this tape of them at the dinner table. There was conflict, sniping and resolution. I call it, \"Fight, fight, fight. Love, love love.\" I came in the next day and said I wanted to do it.\n\nSeacrest I was overseas and got a phone call from E!. \"We're picking it up and going right into production.\" And I said, \"Well, we just bought a camera.\" (Laughs.) They suggested Bunim/Murray to be our partners.\n\nGil Goldschein (CEO and chairman, Bunim/Murray Productions) Within 24 to 36 hours, I did a deal with E!, and we were in preproduction early the following week.\n\nJeff Jenkins (co-president of entertainment & development, Bunim/Murray) During our first meeting, Kris said, \"How can we make this successful?\" And I said, \"Share everything.\" In other documentary series, you're following a football star or a rock star; in this case, sharing is the career.\n\nSeacrest I remember Kris saying, \"In order for this to work, yes, there's a glitz and glamour, but there's got to be honesty and vulnerability. We need to make a pact that the show won't just be pretty pictures. As time goes by, you see some of the most vulnerable moments. There was a deliberate intent to be vulnerable and capture that from the beginning.\n\nKris I sat everyone down and said, \"If we're going to do this, we have to be all in. We have to really be who we are.\"\n\nKendall I was like, \"Whatever. What am I having for lunch tomorrow?\" She didn't make it seem like it was going to last this long.\n\nKim I don't think any of us thought it would.\n\nKris The only person I got any resistance from was Kourtney. She was sort of skeptical.\n\nKourtney I remember in season one being like, \"I have to go the bathroom,\" and I'd cry in there as quietly as I could because I was still mic'd. I never want to cry in front of cameras.\n\nKhloe Kardashian (star, executive producer) I don't think we knew what we were even saying yes to. Everything was just super-fast. Kim and my mom were steering the ship. We were just like, \"Tell us where to be and we'll be there.\"\n\nDogan We were up against an airdate and didn't have a title we loved. There were a few contenders: The Kardashians: Krazy With a K.\n\nFarnaz Farjam (current programming vp, Bunim/Murray) Living Kardashian, Krazy Kardashians \u2026\n\nDogan But none that we loved. We were having our big launch meeting where we invite the producers to come in and tell our internal departments about the show, so everyone can get on the same page.\n\nFarjam We all had been tasked with coming to the meeting with some title ideas and when it was my turn I had to confess I didn't have a list. I made a factual statement that I was \"too busy keeping up with the Kardashians.\"\n\nDolgan Instantly, we knew that was our title.\n\nFarjam I came up with it on accident because I was living it.\n\nHarbert Internally, everybody had an opinion [about the show before it launched]. It was, who are these people and why do they get a TV show? Ad sales departments don't tend to jump up and down about shows that feature people that have been in sex tapes. They're usually going to worry about advertiser resistance, but I don't remember there being much.\n\nKris From the network's point of view it was a big success.\n\nHarbert Sisters who wax each other will tend to strike a chord. I'm a big believer in TV that surprises people, and boy, did that surprise me. I was shocked at how they would speak to their mother and, who was then, Bruce.\n\nKris The watercooler chatter from the first episode was all about [9-year-old] Kylie jumping on a stripper pole. Kim had one installed in my bedroom and our friend Robin Anton, who is the founder of The Pussycat Dolls, was just messing around, and Kylie hops up there, twirls around a couple times, and it became this thing.\n\nSeacrest Some people were up in arms; some people thought it was funny.\n\nKris When I look back on that, I belly laugh. I have a very dry sense of humor. You either think I'm hilarious or you think I'm a bitch.\n\nSeacrest It was in that moment we realized what this show could be. At its foundation, it was an aspirational, Hollywood reality version of The Brady Bunch. They were unvarnished, and that honesty and irreverence resonated.\n\nBrian Dow (former agent for the Kardashians) There was a lot of authenticity. If you look at the rest of the marketplace at the time, other reality stars were showing you their \"character\" and were more guarded.\n\nKhloe In those days, our first and second season especially, no one knew who we were. We were allowed to leave the gates to film and not have it be a distraction. No one bothered us.\n\nKim When we would travel, I remember people calling mine, Kourtney, and Khloe's names and we thought they knew us from high school or something. We just didn't get it. Then they started chasing us down at the airport. That was the first time that we were like, \"Oh my God.\"\n\nKhloe In Armenia, I've never seen so many people. I got separated from Kim and everyone, and they all got in the van and left. I was like, \"Hello? I'm still in the fucking crowd of people!\" Everyone forgot about me and Erin Paxton, our audio mixer, took her boom and literally fished me back into our producer's van.\n\nKendall Kylie and I did a magazine signing for Seventeen, and it was at some store at The Grove and we had a crazy line around the corner. The store owner came up to us and said, \"Justin Bieber was here a week ago and didn't get this response.\"\n\nDow They were flooding the marketplace with good photo content. There's a method to the madness, and when you don't know the method it just looks like madness.\n\nKris It just got really crazy, really fast. They engaged in conversation with an audience that through proper television had been completely ignored.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nBefore filming wrapped on season one, E! re-upped the series for a second turn, just as social media platforms were starting to take hold.\n\nKris There was barely Twitter when we started. Ryan called Kim and said, \"There's this thing called Twitter you might want to pay attention to.\" The girls [began] embracing their audience and sharing their lives.\n\nSeacrest There were conversations where we said, \"Is this OK that posts are happening today and the show airs five months later?\" We didn't know if it was good or bad. We ended up determining that it was fueling the narrative and people will want to see what really happened.\n\nDow Kim sort of paved the way for the economic structure of native influencer marketing. Before the rise of the common man YouTuber in their bedroom, you had people like her. She was the one who kicked down the door and got the brands to spend money in that area because she showed success. Brands noticed that when when you would pay a celebrity to send out a branded tweet, they were getting more click-throughs for the dollar, so it made more monetary sense. That's why that revolution started.\n\nHarbert At the beginning, I tried very hard to get a piece [of the earnings] because the policy was, if you become famous on our backs and get other businesses, we get a piece. Kris, given her great negotiating abilities, said, \"We were already kind of famous.\" I remember those stare-downs, but I lost that fight. You know who I've got 10 percent of? Dr. 90210. That had to be at least $300 or $400 that I made off of that. Almost the same. (Laughs.)\n\nKhloe It's totally a blessing to have the show to put you in that spotlight where you could let people see the brand that you're trying to create. At first, you are bright-eyed and people want to pay you to do the craziest things. Me and my sisters have all done it, but we've learned from those mistakes. I think viewers could see through when things are unauthentic, even with a social media platform. People need to really aware of their authenticity and doing thing out of passion not just to make a dollar. I will say there has been a learning curve.\n\nDow When Kim did the cover of CR [in 2013], that's when she was anointed. It's Carine Roitfeld's magazine, Karl Lagerfeld shot it and Riccardo Tisci art-directed. Fashion washes away all sins. That's when she went next-level.\n\nHarbert Kris deserves the credit for turning it into an empire. Doing the show is a pain in the neck for them, but that TV presence provides the basis for many other products. When somebody leaves the limelight a network provides, it goes away. God bless her, Paris Hilton is a fantastic DJ in Ibiza.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nE! launched the first of nine spinoffs in 2009. That same year, Khloe married NBA star Lamar Odom in an episode that brought record ratings for the network (3.2 million viewers). In 2011, the couple debuted Khloe & Lamar.\n\nHarbert Sometime during the first season, I said, \"There are other shows in this family.\" Being able to get that many franchises from one family is sort of a schedule saver.\n\nSeacrest We had a successful mother ship and we thought, \"Let's try a spinoff.\" They were opening a Dash store in Miami, so that gave us a premise [Kourtney & Kim Take Miami]. I got a call from Jeff Shell, who was under Steve Burke at Comcast, which owned E! before the NBC merger. He said, \"Should we be investing in spinoffs?\" I told him, \"I'll take the risk.\"\n\nHarbert A couple of years in, I said, \"Wait until Kylie and Kendall are 18 years old, then there's a whole new generation of shows that can supply the schedule for years.\" [Life of Kylie premiered Aug. 6 to solid ratings.]\n\nKylie Jenner (star) I feel like I've been hiding myself and my personal life for a really long time, so I thought it was time to do this show and hopefully be a little more understood.\n\nKhloe I never wanted to do Khloe & Lamar [which ran for two seasons in 2011 and 2012]; my ex-husband did. He sold it to E!, and I let it happen because I wanted him to be happy. I was the one who canceled it. It was way too much. [Odom was hospitalized in 2015 after being found unconscious at a Nevada brothel. The couple divorced in 2016.]\n\nJenkins We deferred to Khloe on what she was comfortable with, because someone's life was hanging in the balance and that someone is a hero to a lot of young people. It wasn't necessary to go stick a camera in Lamar's face while he's on death's door in the hospital. It's just too much, so I guess, in a way, there is a line.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nIn August 2011, Kim married NBA player Kris Humphries. The E! special of the $6 million wedding earned the network its highest ratings to date and more than $10 million in ad revenue.\n\nKim There was all this attention on the wedding, and I thought maybe it was just the pressure of the show giving me this anxiety. My friends told me I just had cold feet, but even the producers said, \"You don't seem happy. You don't have to go through with this.\" The night before, my mom pulled me aside, off camera, and was like, \"This isn't it for you. Why don't you go away and I'll handle it?\" I felt like, if I pulled out now, everyone's going to think I just did it for the show. Then afterwards, people were saying, \"You have to stay married for a year,\" but I physically couldn't do it. When I made the decision [to divorce], everyone said it was made up for the show. Everyone really wanted to take me down.\n\nKris People write and say the nastiest things and they've never met you. They have miserable lives, they have no direction, and probably no job. I mean for anybody to sit and be on the internet all day long. It always shocks me when I see such stupidity and really toxic energy.\n\nSeacrest I remember when Kim called me after the wedding. It was just a few days after, and she just didn't feel like it was right. She was very candid and open.\n\nKim Think about this realistically: If it was for the show don't you think we would have found someone that signed off? Someone OK with getting married and getting divorced two months later? If it's for a show don't you think you'd want as little legal trouble as possible? This was real emotions, real feelings. People fuck up.\n\nKendall The beauty of having older sisters is you learn so many lessons from them. I've seen how their relationships have played out on TV so I learned that lesson. I I feel like it's just better to keep it more private.\n\nKourtney The hardest episode to film was my break-up with Scott [Disick]. I had a lot of anxiety about it, and finally said let's just get this over with. I sat down and started crying. You go through something, and then you move past it. Then you do your interview, and get all riled up again. And then you see the episode, and start seeing all these comments [on social media].\n\nKylie When you involve the whole world, everyone has an opinion. It's not the healthiest. That part of your life should remain sacred.\n\nKim It's kind of hard not to at least reference [your relationship]. [Current husband] Kanye [West] was like, \"I'm not a part of the show. That's not what I do. I have my own career and life.\" He'll really surprise you though. He'll be like, \"I'm not filming\" and then randomly show up. But I will get [the footage] and show him. He knew I would love to have my engagement on camera so he filmed it and he said, \"The look might be a little different because I need these type of cameras,\" and got music clearance. But I won't really ever talk about something that's going on with Kanye. I'll talk about how I feel. He knows that I'm really protective of him.\n\nAdam Stotsky (president, E!) Kanye has been gracious enough to be on the show quite a bit. If he had a story that he wanted to tell through the lens of E!, we would be very open to hearing it, that's for sure.\n\nKris Kanye does not have time or have any desire that I know of to do a show like that.\n\nKim We had no intention of showing our wedding on the show. It was shot with only iPhones and my assistant on a handycam. She was literally standing on top of a castle and freezing, because we knew we wanted to capture this gorgeous walk from up above. People were yelling at her like, \"You can't film up there!\" But then we loved the footage so much, [we used some of it on the show].\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nIn 2014, Kris and Bruce Jenner finalized their divorce. The next year, Bruce announced in an interview with Diane Sawyer that he would begin living as a woman and signed on for E! series I Am Cait. In April 2017, Caitlyn released a memoir revealing details of her marriage to Kris.\n\nJenkins I was shooting with Kris during the last conversation she ever had with Bruce. I'm pointing a camera at her while she is having her heart ripped out. Those are not fun days, but those episodes have touched our culture.\n\nKim The most difficult thing [to film] was probably Caitlyn's transition and just seeing my mom and Khloe having such a hard time. We never really edited content before, but we did edit a bit of Khloe's reaction just because she was so upset.\n\nKhloe If I act a certain way, I act a certain way, but I just knew in my head this needed to be a four-hour episode. This is so real, and I want to ask every question I have, but also I want honest answers.\n\nKylie At the time, I didn't think, \"Oh, this is going to make pop culture history.\" I had different things on my mind, because this was my reality, and this is my dad.\n\nStotsky Caitlyn shared an incredible amount of personal history with us before we had even agreed to shoot it. [As an executive], you think about, \"What kind of story do we think we can tell, and given the sensitivity of the matter, do we have the wherewithal to handle it appropriately and not be exploitative?\" And then the last thing you think about is, \"Is it going to be a hit?\" We felt and Caitlyn felt that she had told the story that she wanted to tell in front of the cameras through two cycles and 20 hours [of I Am Cait]. There was a beginning, middle and end. Caitlyn is still a part of Keeping Up With the Kardashians. She is a part of Kylie's life and you will see her in Life of Kylie. Once a Kardashian always a Kardashian.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nIn October 2016, Kim was robbed at gunpoint in Paris after burglars got her location via Snapchat and made off with $10 million in jewelry.\n\nKris Every time I tried to watch the episode when Kim shares her experience getting robbed in Paris, I couldn't even get through it to give my notes. I was crying so hard. I would watch it and then cry, cry, cry and then start over. It was very difficult for me to watch my daughter in that kind of pain.\n\nKim I was OK to show my struggles, because there was no way that I was going to allow it to damage me and make me a different person for my kids. I wasn't going to allow it to debilitate me from being be the mom that I need to be.\n\nKendall Your situation was a scare for all of us.\n\nKim It really changed our lives. This extra layer of security needed to happen. On social media, I'll never post something where I'm at home unless I know there's four to six security. We know when we're filming it doesn't air until months later, so we can share that and be free and always be who we are.\n\nKris It always occurs to me maybe this should be left out. Maybe this is too much. Every time I catch myself and I say no, this is what everyone who's watched since day one deserves to see for one reason or another. We signed up for this.\n\nKim Everyone was calling for a sit-down interview and I was like why would I do an interview about something I was just traumatized from? But I felt really comfortable to tell my story on my show, because it wasn't going to get twisted. I needed time off, but I was going to talk about it. I'm very aware of what fans want to see. I think if you ask the crew, I probably produce the most, because I know what my sisters might not be sharing. So I'll tell them, \"Go over to Kourt's house right now. Something is going on.\"\n\nKendall I'm the most private one. If there's a moment I don't want anyone to hear, I talk to myself or talk to someone in another room.\n\nKim We're not perfect, but you see these things in the media, like Kendall and [her Pepsi ad that was accused of trivializing Black Lives Matter], where I see her at home crying, but in the media she looks another way because she's not addressing it. I'm just like, \"This is wrong. You need to speak up.\" She was like, \"I don't ever want to show that footage of me crying.\" She was trying to not make excuses or be dramatic, but that was what she was going through at the time.\n\nKris There are moments when it's hard to leave something in because it's vulnerable and it exposes us to a deeper level of emotion, and sometimes that's hard to share.\n\nJenkins There are days when there might be 30 crew people at a location to cover an event and there are days where there may be one person with an iPhone covering something incredibly intimate.\n\nKendall We have such a personal relationship with the crew. When one of us cries on the show usually you'll look around and the camera guy is crying and the producer is crying.\n\nKim It really is an intimate relationship. These people see every last thing.\n\nKris I mean, believe me, I'm not going to lie, there's been times when I've walked away from the camera and I've got a big bump in my hair and I'm like \"Take that out, my hair looks like shit.\" I'm too vain to leave really ugly, ugly angles in.\n\nKim I definitely wish I didn't film so much pregnant. I looked like such a cow and I can't stand to see those episodes. I would say, \"Try to film me more from chest up, so it looks better,\" but I look like a blob. I would have rather seen my belly and shot farther away. [On the possibility of a third child with Kanye, reportedly via surrogate] I hope so. There have been a lot of things said and Kanye and I have not confirmed anything. We're definitely trying. We are hoping so.\n\nDow The reason the show has this shelf life is that at its core it's about family and everyone can relate to it on some level. It has this ongoing ability to allow people to relate even if they don't live a life that's anywhere similar they can find connections to the material. The girls are incredibly hard workers and they had the ability to evolve so they didn't just get stuck. They constantly reinvented themselves with an upward trajectory.\n\nKhloe I know people think, \"You guys just film and eat your salads and drink iced tea all day.\" I think if someone tried to spend a week with us and did what we do \u2014 I'm not complaining about what we do at all, but it's a job.\n\nSeacrest This family has been through things in their life that have introduced understanding and acceptance to people. Everything from interracial relationships to addiction to the Bruce-to-Caitlyn transition. There will always be a story; as they're committed to doing it, the show can go on.\n\nHarbert You can have whatever opinion you want about the Kardashians, but they deliver a true family drama. When people ask me what [shows] I've been involved in, I love to mention Kardashians. I'll get that \"really?\" look, and I just look them in the eye and say, \"The job is to put on hits, and this is a hit. So, sorry.\" You can decide if you're not a fan of the way they speak or the language they use, but as far as I can tell, the republic is still standing, and we've got bigger problems than the Kardashians.\n\nStotsky It's unfortunate people won't give them the credit they're due. If you take a step back and assess what they've built, it's extra\u00adordinary, and it didn't happen by accident.\n\nKris When we first started, I jokingly said, \"We'll be on season 32, Kylie gets married.\" I was kidding, and here we are, and it's season 14, so be careful what you wish for.\n\nAdditional reporting by Lacey Rose.\n\nA version of this story first appeared in the Aug. 16 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

{"label": false, "txt": "Remember when all the Kardashians and Jenners got on and life was much simpler?\n\nUs too. But now the back-and-forth shade between the three Kardashian sisters, Kris Jenner and her ex-husband Caitlyn Jenner is at an all time high.\n\nThrough a timeline of shade, we look back at what's been going on with America's most famous reality show family.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nThe family in 1995 Getty Images\n\nJune 2015: It all starts with the internet-breaking Vanity Fair interview - where she reveals her identity as Caitlyn to the world for the first time. Among the iconic pictures shot by Annie Leibowitz are comments about her relationship with Kris.\n\nVanity Fair\n\nFirstly the two disagree on how much Caitlyn had told Kris about her gender identity issues, the fact she had taken female hormones in the 1980s and also dabbled with cross-dressing.\n\nShe also says the breakdown of their 23-year marriage was down to \"20 per cent gender and 80 per cent [was] the way I was treated\".\n\nKris tells the magazine Caitlyn was \"miserable\" and \"pissed off\" during the last years of their marriage.\n\nAugust 2015: On Caitlyn's new E! show, I Am Cait, Khloe is seen visiting Caitlyn where she takes issue with her comments about Kris.\n\nCaitlyn tells Khloe sent her \"tough\" text messages, to which Khloe responds: \"I said we don't care what you're doing... we want to be there and support you but we don't think that entails you speaking negatively about my mum. In our opinion you don't even need to mention my mum. Let's focus on the actual cause here and not drag my mum through the mud.\"\n\nOctober 2015: Season 10 of Keeping up with the Kardashians shows Kris' reaction to the Vanity Fair interview and she is, shall we say, more explicit with her wording.\n\n\"He can go f*** himself,\" she cries down the phone to a deadpan Kim. \"I honestly wish I never met this man. I mean, just f*** you, Bruce.\"\n\nCaitlyn and Kris Jenner at the 2015 Victoria\u2019s Secret show Getty Images\n\nKim tells the camera: \"All Caitlyn can talk about is that my mum mistreated her and was awful and all these really rude things, when there's no reason to bash my mum.\"\n\nNovember 2015: Khloe appears on the Ellen Show saying she had a particularly hard time accepting Caitlyn's transition because she found out on camera.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n\"We kept asking him, 'Bruce, like what's going on? We're hearing all these rumours?' and he kept telling us one thing but really he knew he was transitioning and wouldn't be honest with us.\n\n\"So really we felt like the last to know so that was hard for us, especially me.\"\n\nJanuary 2016: Khloe appears on the Howard Stern Show where she is very candid about a whole lot of things, including Caitlyn.\n\nSaying she found out about Caitlyn's transition at the same time that \"business people\" knew, despite repeatedly asking her whether the rumours about her transgender identity were true, she says she felt \"betrayed\".\n\n\"We felt so like, 'what the f***? We've been asking you and why do business people know?' I never want someone to feel like they have one-up on our family. We are a family. We've never turned our backs on each other yet with all the clusterf***s of s*** that's happened in our lives, why would we now?\n\n\"I don't give a f*** what you want to do - just stop lying to us about things... Just lay it on the table, what are we doing? What's happening? Even then he didn't tell us... we didn't know when he was going to start fully dressing as Caitlyn.\"\n\nMay 2016: It later turns out that Caitlyn was not ok with what Khloe said on Howard Stern, as was revealed on the season 12 premiere of KUWTK.\n\nAccording to Khloe, she was inundated with angry messages from Caitlyn after the interview so naturally she vented to matriarch Kris:\n\n\"I said, 'You slaughtered my mother and you have the nerve to say, 'What happened to family sticking together?' You jumped that ship as soon as you did Diane Sawyer and attacked my mum', and instead, [she] tells me to 'get a life' and 'shut up' and I'm like, 'you shut up and you get a f***ing life.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\n\"...

You don't go on Howard Stern and call me a liar.\"\n\nAugust 2016: Caitlyn spends Father's Day with her youngest daughter Kylie watching basketball games. All seems well until she takes to Snapchat to joke about why Kylie is her favourite daughter.\n\nCaitlyn and Kylie in November, 2015 Getty Images\n\n\"Why, because it's Father's Day and she's the only one that invited me over,\" she tells her followers.\n\nAccording to Mail Online, Kim later said the rumours that all the siblings had abandoned Caitlyn on Father's Day were not true and that she had actually invited her for brunch.\n\nOctober 2016: Kris and Kim have an almighty row on KUWTK when Kris finds out that her daughter helped Caitlyn get ready for the ESPY awards in July, 2016.\n\nWhen Kim tells her mother she wanted to stay neutral between the estranged couple, Kris yells: \"I want loyalty. I don't want f***ing neutral. I'm trying to be as gracious as I can, I'm trying to be as understanding as I can. I'm betrayed.

Ouch.\n\nShe says Kendall is the most down-to-earth of all the girls.\n\nThe Kardashians were not largely included in the Diane Sawyer documentary - which saw Caitlyn come out as transgender for the first time - because \"research shows that whenever a Kardashian is on television, many in the public tend to think it is a publicity stunt to make money\". Eek.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nThe Kardashians read the memoir and are not at all happy. In an episode of KUWTK Kris claims: \"Everything that she says is made up\" and claims the only nice thing Caitlyn had to say about her is that she's great at parties.\n\n\"I've never been so angry and disappointed in somebody in my whole life,\" Kris vented.\n\nAppearing on Late Night with Seth Meyers to promote the book, the co-author Buzz Bissinger responds, saying: \"Kris is full of s***\".\n\nLater in the month, Kim wades in telling The Ellen DeGeneres Show Caitlyn was not honest in the book about certain things to do with her mother.\n\n\"It's taken her a really long time to be honest with herself so I don't expect her to be honest with my Mum now. It's just so hurtful. I wish her all the success in the world but not at our expense,\" she says.\n\nCaitlyn also does another show with Diane Sawyer, where she says: \"Some [of my children] I have remained very close to. A couple of them... I'm a little more distant. I have to admit, I'll sit here and wonder, 'Is it because of my transitioning? Or is it because their life is so busy that they don't call, like all the time?'... Nobody calls that much. I mostly reach out to them. Obviously the Jenner side call more, but they have their own lives.\"\n\nMay 2017: Kim appears on 'Plead the Fifth' on Watch What Happens Live where Andy Cohen asks her the chances of Kris and Caitlyn ever speaking again.\n\n\"Zero, one, no, two per cent and those are Kendall and Kylie. All fair, I think,\" she said casually.\n\nOn KUWTK later in the month, Kim tells Kourtney that, in her book, Caitlyn is \"so angry with mum for no reason\".\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nKourtney chimes in on Caitlyn's claim that the Kardashians were excluded from the Diane Sawyer documentary because the name is associated with publicity stunts, adding: \"That sounds pathetic.\"\n\nJune 2017: For the first time, Caitlyn's daughter Kendall also wades in on the book on KUWTK where she's seen slamming the table in frustration.\n\n\"I spoke to Kim about Dad's book and heard about all the stuff she was saying in it and how a lot of it is so not true,\" Kendall tells her mum Kris. \"The weird part is I don't think it's purposeful lying, I think she really just thinks that's what happened... and then she goes around dissing the Kardashians but those are the kids that you raised, if you have a problem with them you raised them.\n\n\"It makes no sense to me that she would go around bashing them for no reason, that's insane.\"\n\nKris calls the book a \"fabrication\" a few times, too.\n\nKim is also back again on the book, saying she has \"no respect\" for Caitlyn anymore.\n\nKendall, Caitlyn and Kylie Jenner in June, 2017 Getty Images\n\nAugust 2017: In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Kris rebukes the claim that it was Caitlyn who came up with the premise for the reality show that made the family the superstars they are today.\n\n\"It's so absurd,\" Kris says. \"I'm not sure what the motivation was for her to say something like that. Maybe somebody should remind her it's called Keeping up with the Kardashians.\"\n\nOooo. Burn.\n\nSeptember 2017: In the premiere of season 14 of KUWTK, Kim takes aim with another part of Caitlyn's book which suggested that her dad - the late Robert Kardashian who defended his friend OJ Simpson in the infamous 1992 murder trial - at one point believed OJ to be guilty.\n\n\"I have always had Caitlyn's back,\" Kim says. \"She is a liar. She is not a good person.\"\n\n\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nCaitlyn then tells Good Morning Britain that she and Kim have not spoken in nine months.\n\n\"I love Kim so much, it's such a huge loss in my life not having her there anymore,\" she tells Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid. \"It's really sad.\"\n\nShe adds that \"the Kardashians, particularly Kris, didn't react that way [being proud of her book] even though I went overboard to be nice and friendly\".\n\nOctober 2017: The Kardashian siblings continue airing their thoughts on Caitlyn's book on KUWTK when Kim finds out about Caitlyn's gender reassignment surgery through the media.\n\nKhloe does not hold back with her comments - while on a private jet flying to Cleveland (as they do) - claiming that Caitlyn plays the victim.\n\n\"I'm the victim, I'm the victim, they don't want to see me. Oh f*** off and it's not because you're trans,\" Khloe vents. \"That's not why I'm not talking to you. I'm not talking to you because you're a bad, mean person.\"\n\nOoof.\n\nNovember 2017: Caitlyn's Jenner gives a talk at Cambridge University's union, and says the Kardashians have hurt her badly.\n\n\"It's been a little bit tough over the last couple of years on the Kardashian side,\" she says - which, in light of the above, is a bit of an understatement. She says she hasn't spoken to Kim in over a year and other recent reports in the The Sun claim she hasn't talked to Khloe in two years.\n\n\"They don't want me in their lives, they bashed me pretty badly. It's devastating when your kids do that. It really hurt... In the book I express some opinions and got shot down. It was not about the Kardashians. They were only mentioned on 20 pages. They made it more about them on television. The book was about my life. That's caused a lot of the separation between us.\"\n\nDecember 2017: Caitlyn reveals on Piers Morgan's Life Stories that she didn't trust his ex-wife or step-children with news of her gender reassignment surgery, as she thought they'd leak it to the press.\n\n\"They didn\u2019t know that you had actually had the surgery?\", Morgan asked, when Jenner admitted to sending Kim a preview copy of her memoir The Secrets Of My Life, but removing the section about her surgery.\n\n\"No I didn\u2019t tell anybody. Why? It\u2019s none of their business\", Jenner responded. \"It\u2019s not that big a deal. Nobody knows. I had to be honest, the book is about honesty. It\u2019s called The Secrets Of My Life. No it really wasn\u2019t a big deal. I had already been living as Caitlyn for a year and a half, ok, nobody knows anything. Because I didn\u2019t want them to leak it to the press. There was no reason for them to know about it.\n\nAsked if she didn\u2019t trust the Kardashians, she replied: \u2018Of course not \u2013 of course I didn\u2019t trust them.\u2019\n\n"}
{"label": false, "txt": "\u00a9 Gossip Cop (Getty Images) Is Queen Elizabeth ordering Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to tone down the PDA? That\u2019s the latest rumor to emerge in the tabloids about the royal family. Gossip Cop, however, can bust the untrue claims.\n\nThe story in question appears in the Australian edition of Woman\u2019s Day, which exclaims in a headline, \u201cThe Queen Is Not Amused!\u201d The piece begins by asserting Prince Harry and Markle \u201ccouldn\u2019t keep their hands off each other\u201d at the Royal Foundation Forum last month, and contends that \u201cwhile their affectionate behavior may be adorable to many, one person isn\u2019t so thrilled: Harry\u2019s grandmother.\u201d It\u2019s specifically alleged the queen has \u201cwarned Harry to tone down the public displays of affection\u2026 and start acting more prim and proper like other royals,\u201d namely Prince William and Kate Middleton.\n\n\u201cBeing affectionate just comes naturally to Harry and Meghan, but it\u2019s totally against royal protocol,\u201d claims a so-called \u201cinsider,\u201d who further alleges, \u201cThe queen isn\u2019t thrilled about it at all and word is she summoned Harry to the palace to remind him what\u2019s expected of a royal.\u201d This supposed tipster maintains, \u201cAll the hand-holding just isn\u2019t the royal way at all.\u201d\n\nConsequently, the outlet asserts Prince Harry understands \u201che and Meghan will have to tone things down from now on.\u201d Alleges the publication\u2019s purported source, \u201cHarry has so much respect for his grandmother, and while he doesn\u2019t see anything wrong with what they\u2019re doing in public, he certainly wouldn\u2019t want to be seen as disobeying orders.\u201d But Queen Elizabeth, Gossip Cop has learned, has never given Prince Harry and Markle any such \u201corder.\u201d\n\nContrary to the assertions here, there are no official royal protocols against PDA. In fact, Prince Charles and Duchess Camilla were photographed sharing a kiss last year. They also regularly hold hands in public. In contrast, his oldest son and daughter-in-law tend to avoid showing PDA while in the public eye, though Prince William and Middleton have held hands on occasion, such as when they were photographed arriving for a Christmas service in December. Simply put, it is up to each couple to decide what conduct is appropriate for them and under which setting. Prince Harry and Markle like to hold hands, although it\u2019s possible their decorum will change once they officially wed.\n\nRegardless, they haven\u2019t engaged in any behavior that is actually out of line. And if the tabloid\u2019s \u201cinsider\u201d really had inside knowledge, he or she would know that not only isn\u2019t there any official protocol against PDA, but that Prince Charles and Prince William have shown affection to their respective significant others without repercussion. It\u2019s also worth noting that Prince Harry and Markle even held hands during the official photos taken following their engagement announcement (see above). Clearly this kind of PDA is a non-issue.\n\nRelated slideshow: Debunking the week's tabloid stories:"}
{"label": false, "txt": "\u00a9 Gossip Cop (Getty Images)\n\nLady Gaga did not have a face lift before this year\u2019s Grammy Awards, despite a new report. Gossip Cop can exclusively correct this story, which falsely alleges the singer went under the knife for her performance at the annual awards show. We\u2019re told it\u2019s \u201cnot true.\u201d\n\nAccording to RadarOnline, the star had a \u201cfresh new face\u201d at the 60th annual Grammys. In the story, a medical professional is quoted as telling the online publication, \u201cIt certainly looks as though Lady Gaga could have had work done. Fillers in her cheeks, lip injections and a brow lift.\u201d The outlet\u2019s supposed \u201csource\u201d continues to claim, \u201cIt\u2019s likely she has been doing some lasers and micro needling therapies for her skin which is glowing,\u201d before asserting that the singer has a much more \u201cyouthful appearance.\u201d\n\nThe article was even picked up by the Daily Star, which quotes yet another \u201cmedical professional\u201d as saying, \u201cThe nose looks straighter and narrower, and the tip more defined. Even though her nose looks different, it might be a result of some fillers and botox combined.\u201d Accompanied by a series of \u201cbefore and after\u201d photos, the British tabloid goes on to add, \u201cMany fans were far too distracted by Lady Gaga\u2019s physical transformation to comment\u201d on her red carpet look at this year\u2019s Grammy Awards. Predictably, neither outlet provides the reader with any actual evidence to support its claims.\n\nBut Gossip Cop checked in with a rep for Gaga, who assures us the entire report is completely \u201cfalse.\u201d We\u2019re further told her Grammys look was crafted through make-up, particularly contouring, which sharpens and defines the face. What\u2019s more, given that Lady Gaga is currently on her Joanne World Tour, it\u2019s hard to believe she had time to have a pre-Grammys face lift. It\u2019s all lies.\n\nOddly, this isn\u2019t the first time the singer has been accused of going under the knife. Remember, Gossip Cop previously corrected the untrustworthy MediaTakeOut for wrongly claiming Gaga had undergone \u201cextensive plastic surgery.\u201d In that narrative, and without any evidence to support its premise, the website alleged Gaga had \u201cgone too far\u201d and looked \u201cvery unnatural.\u201d Predictably, given MediaFakeOut\u2019s long history of posting nonsense, the entire report was nothing more than a fabrication, and the same goes for this latest article about Gaga having a pre-Grammys face lift."}

{"label": false, "txt": "Taylor Swift has done everything she can to rattle cages with her new single, \"Look What You Made Me Do,\" but not everything she's done so far has been welcomed with open arms. A big discovery was made shortly after she announced when her next album would be released \u2014 it coincided with the 10th anniversary of Kanye West's mother passing away.\n\nThough Swift was, well, swift to deny any intent to antagonize Kanye with the drop date, she has resorted to all sorts of petty moves in the past. Her discontent with Kanye runs deep, from award show embarrassments to his infamous, \"I made that b---h famous\" line on \"Famous,\" so she has the motivation to attack him and his family if she wants to.\n\nNot content to take Swift's denial at face value, Kanye fans have decided to strike back against the pop star, and they're planning their own event for Nov. 10. Allow me to introduce you to \"Hey Mama\" day, a concept dreamed up by some of Kanye's biggest fans on the r/Kanye subreddit. Here's a brief description of what they plan to accomplish. The subreddit that started it all. Reddit\n\n\"Basically, Taylor Swift has released a Kanye diss track, taken shots at Kim's Paris robbery, and has stolen Kanye's font and cover art style for her new album 'Reputation.' Most importantly she is planning on releasing it on the anniversary of Kanye's mother, Donda West's death - November 10. Basically, we have the idea to repeatedly stream a singular Kanye song on that date, hopefully getting that song the #1 spot on daily streams over any of Taylor's songs. We are focussing on a single song as it will be much easier to concentrate our efforts into that, than say a whole album getting to #1.\"\n\nThe post gained enough traction that it rose near the top of the subreddit, and now there's an event page for the day on Facebook. The title has been altered a bit to, \"Listen to Hey Mama by Kanye West Day\" but the concept is still the same, and the interest is beginning to grow. So far, around 2,200 dedicated fans (or T. Swift haters) have declared interest in participating, and Spotify playlists of just \"Hey Mama\" have been created in advance of the event. These people are not messing around."}

{"label": false, "txt": "Despite being just 20 years old, Kylie Jenner has been the subject of much speculation about whether or not she's had plastic surgery. At last count, it's been five years since the world became obsessed with Kylie's lips. Some of her fans even tried using a lip-enhancing tool to get a Jenner-sized pout. (Spoiler: the #KylieJennerLipChallenge did not end well.) For a long time, the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star denied getting injections, instead claiming that she had been over lining her lips. However, she recently came clean about the lip fillers, explaining that she's been having them done for five years. This got us thinking: What else has Kylie had done that she hasn't told us about? Here, plastic surgeon Dr Andrea Giannitrapani from MYA gives his professional opinion on the procedures Kylie Jenner miiiight have had done.\n\nLips\n\nSo, Kylie's lips are no longer a mystery: She's definitely had them done. On a recent episode of Life of Kylie, she opened up about why she got them done:\n\n\u201cI was 15 and I was insecure about my lips. I have really small lips. And it was like one of my first kisses and a guy was like, \u2018I didn\u2019t think you would be a good kisser because you have such small lips.\u2019 I took that really hard. When a guy you like says that, I don\u2019t know, it just really affected me. I just didn\u2019t feel desirable or pretty. \u201cI would overline my lips with the lip liner to create the illusion of bigger lips and then, finally, I was like, this lip liner isn't doing it and ended up getting my lips done.\u201d\n\nBreasts\n\nIn 2015, Kylie posted on her app, telling her fans that the secret to her new, bigger boobs was a Victoria's Secret bra. \"Everyone thinks I've gotten a breast augmentation recently and I haven't.\" She adds, \"I just use the 'Bombsh ell' by Victoria's Secret \u2013 it's life-changing. I've gotten all my sisters on it, all my friends and if you ever want the look of bigger breasts, that's what I do.\"\n\nReferring to the above images, Dr Giannitrapani thinks that Kylie has probably had breast augmentation. \"There is a clear size increase to Kylie's breasts looking at the side profile of these comparison pictures,\" he said. \"Although they are not out of proportion with her frame, they have the characteristics of a breast enlargement in the early stages of healing and look as though they still need time to settle.\" \"If she intended on keeping the procedure a secret, the surgeon will have gone for an implant size to suit her frame and for the result to look as natural as possible whilst still creating the volume increase she desired.\"\n\nCurves"}

{"label": false, "txt": "Jamie McCarthy\n\nAlbum art forThe Life of Pablo\n\n1. \u201cUltralight Beam\u201d\n\n\n\nRight from the top, \u201cUltralight Beam\u201d seems to signal to listeners that TLOP will be the anti-Yeezus. It even begins with a literal casting-out of devils: A recording of a young girl (apparently taken from Instagram), saying, \u201cWe don\u2019t want no devils in the house! We want the Lord!\u201d\n\n\n\nThe exorcism performed, the track quickly moves into the prophesied gospel: \u201cWe on an ultra light beam \u2026 This is a God dream \u2026 This is everything,\u201d West sings. Though the track, a clear highlight, is packed with guests, the runaway star is Chance the Rapper. Even setting aside the rising star\u2019s overflowing talent, featuring him at the top of the album was a brilliant bit of casting: Not only has Chance started combining hip-hop and gospel himself (the track also features gospel artist and past Chance collaborator Kirk Franklin), but he is a longtime Kanye superfan, for whom finally getting to work for West is itself a sort of religious moment. As Chance says, \u201cI met Kanye West/ I\u2019m never going to fail.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n2. \u201cFather Stretch My Hands Pt. 1\u201d\n\nAfter opening with the gospel sounds of Pastor T.L. Barrett\u2019s \u201cFather Stretch My Hands,\u201d this two-parter quickly moves from the sacred to the profane. As Wests raps at the top of the opening verse, over a Metro Boomin beat, \u201cNow if I f--k this model/ And she just bleached her asshole/ And I get bleach on my T-shirt/ I\u2019mma feel like an asshole.\u201d\n\n\n\n3. \u201cFather Stretch My Hands Pt. 2\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter a sample from Street Fighter II (\u201cPerfect!\u201d) brings Part 1 to a close, Part 2 turns confessional, as West reflects on the calamities his family has faced, including his mother\u2019s tragic death, his father\u2019s struggles with money, and his own nearly fatal car crash. The day of the album\u2019s release, West tweeted the lyrics, saying, \u201cI cried writing this. I love my Dad.\u201d But West has always embraced contradictions, and these confessional lyrics play over a repeated sample of \u201cPanda\u201d\u2014a swaggering, a street-tough track from new G.O.O.D. music signee Desiigner\u2014all before a melancholy vocoder coda that sounds like Imogen Heap.\n\n\n\n4. \u201cFamous\u201d\n\nAgain, gospel and cursing, sacred and profane. This one opens with Rihanna singing over church organ, seconds before West delivers what has instantly became the most controversial line on the album: \u201cFor all my Southside niggas that know me best/ I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex/ Why? I made that bitch famous.\u201d TMZ cites unnamed sources \u201cdirectly connected with Swift\u201d to claim that Swift approved the line beforehand, understanding it was just a joke. Swift\u2019s publicist has denied this, saying, \u201cKanye did not call for approval, but to ask Taylor to release his single \u2018Famous\u2019 on her Twitter account.\u201d The publicist continued, \u201cShe declined and cautioned him about releasing a song with such a strong misogynistic message,\u201d and added, \u201cTaylor was never made aware of the actual lyric, \u2018I made that bitch famous.\u2019 \u201d For his part, West is more or less sticking by his story:\n\nFirst thing is I\u2019m an artist and as an artist I will express how I feel with no censorship \u2014 KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) February 12, 2016\n\n2nd thing I asked my wife for her blessings and she was cool with it \u2014 KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) February 12, 2016\n\n3rd thing I called Taylor and had a hour long convo with her about the line and she thought it was funny and gave her blessings \u2014 KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) February 12, 2016\n\n4th Bitch is an endearing term in hip hop like the word Nigga \u2014 KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) February 12, 2016\n\n5th thing I\u2019m not even gone take credit for the idea\u2026 it\u2019s actually something Taylor came up with \u2026 \u2014 KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) February 12, 2016\n\nShe was having dinner with one of our friends who\u2019s name I will keep out of this and she told him \u2014 KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) February 12, 2016\n\nI can\u2019t be mad at Kanye because he made me famous! #FACTS \u2014 KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) February 12, 2016\n\nThe rest is, lyrically, fairly straightforward: West raps about being famous and how it makes others jealous. But the sonic collage is all over the place, from the Swizz Beatz beat to the samples of Sister Nancy\u2019s reggae classic \u201cBam Bam,\u201d to, on the outro, a sample of Nina Simone\u2019s \u201cDo What You Gotta Do.\u201d\n\n\n\n5. \u201cFeedback\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThis song finds another way to pun on the idea of the album as gospel: \u201cY\u2019all heard about the GOOD news?\u201d, referencing the origins of the word gospel in order to make a pun about his own GOOD Music label. West raps over a beat seemingly constructed from audio feedback, one of his best. The subject matter, meanwhile, is wide-ranging, with West telling listeners to \u201cWake up, nigga, wake up!\u201d Is this a reference to staying woke? It\u2019s hard to say, but, elsewhere on the track, West leaves no room for doubt about his allegiance to Black Lives Matter, rapping, \u201cHands up, we just doing what the cops taught us/ Hands up, hands up, and the cops shot us.\u201d\n\n\n\n6. \u201cLow Lights\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cLow Lights\u201d is essentially an extended intro to \u201cHighlights,\u201d with the two tracks returning to the same template set up at the top of the album: \u201cLow Lights\u201d is a jubilant one-minute intro that rejoices in God (albeit over melancholy piano chords, with DJ Mustard-style synth bass slathered on top), before \u201cHighlights\u201d brings things back down to earthly temptations.\n\n\n\n7. \u201cHighlights\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cSometimes I\u2019m wishing that my dick had GoPro/ So I could play that shit back in slo-mo/ Just shot an amateur video. I think I should go pro.\u201d That begins to sum up the conceit of the song: for Kanye West, some nights are nothing but highlights.\n\n\n\nFor the most part, this possible first single (West has said that he and Young Thug will perform the song on Saturday Night Live on Saturday) maintains that jocular tone throughout, with memorable lines like \u201cI bet me and Ray J\u2019d be friends,/ if we ain\u2019t love the same bitch./ Yeah, he might have hit it first/ Only problem is: I\u2019m rich.\u201d A reference to Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna\u2019s sexercise regimen also suggests that this verse was recorded in the last two or three weeks. Of course, West has been making sexercise jokes since the first album, and he ends the song with another new workout plan.\n\n\n\n8. \u201cFreestyle 4\u201d\n\n\n\nRemember when I said that TLOP isn\u2019t all the anti-Yeezus? This \u201cfreak dream\u201d would have fit right in on that album and marks the beginning of TLOP\u2019s turn toward more nightmarish material. Like Yeezus\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m in It,\u201d this freaky sex fantasy is a mix of horror sounds (hear those Bernard Herrmann-esque strings?) and explicit lyrics (here they\u2019re mostly about getting it on in public). Surely some fans will, as West later puts it, \u201cmiss the old Kanye.\u201d\n\n\n\n9. \u201cI Love Kanye\u201d\n\n\n\nThis charming a-cappella interlude finds West speaking directly to (and for) his fans, as he addresses those who have been disappointed with West\u2019s Yeezus-era sourness and aggression and want the cuddly, soul-sampling Kanye back. He returns to that friendlier mode here, while offering no apologies for his recent work. As he says at the song\u2019s highly quotable closing:\n\nWhat if Kanye made a song about Kanye\n\nCalled \u201cI Miss the Old Kanye\u201d\n\nMan, that would be so Kanye. That\u2019s all it was, Kanye.\n\nWe still love Kanye, and I love you like Kanye loves Kanye.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n10. \u201cWaves\u201d\n\n\n\nAccording to West, the late addition of this song is the reason the album got delayed an extra day, but the wait was worth it. Another uplifting/vulgar track in the vein of the Chance collaboration that opens the album, \u201cWaves\u201d finds West mixing braggodocious bars (\u201cStep up in this bitch like/ I\u2019m the one your bitch like\u201d) with a more somber message about death, or the legacy of relationships: \u201cEven when somebody go away/ the feelings don't really go away/ That\u2019s just the wave.\u201d\n\nI wrote and arranged and fought for Waves, and I make great decisions. S/o to @chrisbrown I been a fan since day one \ud83d\udcaf\ud83d\udcaf \u2014 Chance The Rapper (@chancetherapper) February 14, 2016\n\n11. \u201cFML\u201d\n\n\n\nThough the title of this one puns on the teen-slang acronym for \u201cF--k my life,\u201d make no mistake: This is a dark song that finds West pondering self-destruction. It\u2019s only appropriate, then, that West also gets an assist from R&B\u2019s leading poet of self-destruction, the Weeknd, who sings the titular phrase on the chorus, \u201cWish I would go ahead and fuck my life up/ Can\u2019t let them get to me/ And even though I always fuck my life up/ Only I can mention me.\u201d West even makes mention\u2014not for the first time\u2014of the anti-depression and anti-anxiety drug Lexapro, something with which he seems to have personal experience. Before, he complained about the side effects, and this time he talks about what happens when you go off it.\n\n\n\n12. \u201cReal Friends\u201d\n\nThis is the first song from The Life of Pablo that was available in a studio version before, and it doesn\u2019t seem to have undergone any significant changes. As before, it\u2019s a confessional song, with \u201cBlame Game\u201d-esque production (built around another melancholy piano loop). But while \u201cBlame Game\u201d was about a breakup, this one is about the struggle to maintain relationships with friends. Once again, everyone is to blame: West for staying too busy to keep up (\u201cI guess I get what I deserve, don\u2019t I?\u201d), and West\u2019s friends for concealing hidden self-interests.\n\n\n\n13. \u201cWolves\u201d\n\nThis is another one we\u2019d heard before\u2014both at Yeezy Season 1 and on SNL\u2019s 40th anniversary special\u2014but unlike \u201cReal Friends,\u201d it\u2019s changed a lot. The most notable change is that in place of the old verses from Vic Mensa and Sia, the song now features a new verse from West and an outro from longtime collaborator Frank Ocean. That new verse\u2014delivered over the same blend of heavy, ominous-sounding bass and soaring (howling?) falsetto that anchored the original track\u2014fleshes out the song\u2019s central metaphor. In it, West imagines himself and wife Kim Kardashian as the rap game Joseph and Mary, before worrying about his two children: \u201cCover Nori in lambs\u2019 wool/ We\u2019re surrounded by wolves \u2026 Cover Saint in lambs\u2019 wool/ We\u2019re surrounded by the f--kin\u2019 wolves.\u201d\n\n\n\n14. \u201cSilver Surfer Intermission\u201d\n\n\n\nThis interlude marks the transition from the album West played at MSG to what could almost be considered the deluxe-edition bonus tracks. In itself, it\u2019s not much more than West trying to get the last word on a recent beef: After Wiz Khalifa came at West for naming the album Waves (briefly, before changing it once again), claiming that West was stealing from the so-called \u201cwavy movement\u201d pioneered by Max B., West plays a message from Max B. that gives the album his blessing.\n\n\n\n15. \u201c30 Hours\u201d\n\n\n\nThis late addition, premiered on Friday, opens with a sample of disco producer and composer Arthur Russell\u2019s \u201cAnswers Me,\u201d which repeats in various forms throughout. The lyrics start with West\u2019s smoothie-drinking life in the present day before he reflects back on an affair for which he drove 30 hours across the country, and then 30 hours back. An aura of disappointment looms over this flashback (and I\u2019m not just talking about how West\u2019s paramour eats all his Popeye\u2019s), which also finds the rapper referencing Nelly and taking some typically unnecessary shots at an ex. (\u201cMy ex says she gave me the best years of her life,\u201d he raps, \u201cI saw a recent picture of her\u2014I guess she was right.\u201d)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n16. \u201cNo More Parties in L.A.\u201d\n\n\n\nIs this back on the album due to popular demand? The long-awaited first collaboration between Kendrick Lamar and Kanye West became a fan favorite after West shared it in mid-January, but it briefly disappeared from West\u2019s ever-evolving tracklists. Thought it\u2019s Lamar who\u2019s known for rapid-fire raps, the Madlib-produced showcase centers around West rattling off rhymes for almost four minutes straight. As he says a few minutes in, \u201cSome fans thought I wouldn\u2019t rap like this again.\u201d I guess this is that \u201cold Kanye\u201d?\n\n17. \u201cFacts\u201d (Charlie Heat Version)\n\nWhile many fans were outraged to see \u201cNo More Parties in L.A.\u201d briefly disappear from the tracklist, fewer were sad about the prospect of losing this Nike diss track. In what amounts to a parody of \u201cJumpman\u201d from Nike pitch man Drake and his collaborator Future (West even borrows the flow), West brags about the success of his Yeezy shoes. That said, as West made extra clear as he debuted the new version of the song (from GOOD music producer Charlie Heat), he has no beef with the original Jumpman himself, Michael Jordan. (Still, he couldn\u2019t help but add: \u201cPeople come to Madison Square Garden to see me play one-on-no-one.\u201d)\n\n"}

The feud initially involved Hoda\u2019s co-host for the wine-sipping hour of the Today show, Kathie Lee Gifford.\n\nWhen Gifford was absent from the show, fans speculated that she was jealous of Kotb\u2019s promotion, and some thought Kathie Lee would quit. There were also reports that Hoda feels she has become \u201ctoo big\u201d for her gig with Gifford and is ready to quit as well, as the Inquisitr reported.\n\nMegyn Kelly Jabs At Hoda Kotb During Today Show\n\nIn addition to the alleged feud between Kotb and Kathie Lee, there are rumors of a new battle in the Today show newsroom. That rumored feud involves Hoda, her co-anchor Savannah Guthrie, and Megyn Kelly, along with the producers, an NBC News insider told Page Six.\n\n\u201cThe atmosphere is so bad around Megyn Kelly at Today that producers of the 7-to-9 a.m. slot, hosted by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, are openly sniping at her.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of Lauer\u2019s exit and Hoda\u2019s promotion, Megyn follows Kotb and Guthrie in the Today show\u2019s 9 a.m. time slot. Kelly saved her congratulations for the broadcast, but Megyn\u2019s supposed congratulatory remark to Hoda was seen as a \u201cMean Girls\u201d type of jab.\n\nHoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie made history as the \u201cToday\u201d show\u2019s first female co-anchors in more than 60 years. Craig Ruttle / AP Images\n\n\u201cWe talked recently about how, 10 years ago, your life was very different,\u201d said Kelly on air to Kotb. \u201cYou were going through a dark period.\u201d\n\nStaffers assumed that Megyn was talking about Hoda\u2019s breast cancer diagnosis and subsequent surgery. But rather than explain that to viewers, Kelly probed Kotb, asking if Hoda ever took time to contemplate her life and think \u201choly moly.\u201d\n\nNBC News Staffers Shocked By Nasty On-Air Exchange\n\nWhen Megyn mentioned Hoda\u2019s \u201cdark period\u201d without explaining it to viewers, NBC News staff members in the control room were horrified, said the insider.\n\n\u201cEverybody in the control room gasped when Megyn brought up Hoda\u2019s \u2018dark period,\u2019 because many viewers likely won\u2019t know exactly what she was referring to. That comment was awkward, mean-spirited. It really stung.\u201d\n\nBecause Kotb and Guthrie have their own production team and staff while Kelly has a separate group of employees, the feud reportedly has divided the newsroom. After Megyn threw shade at Hoda, Kotb and her team fought back. As a result, the source revealed that the atmosphere for the staff as well as co-anchors has become increasingly \u201cbad.\u201d\n\nHoda Kotb & Savannah Guthrie Fight Back At Megyn Kelly\n\nIn the wake of Kelly\u2019s broadcast comment about Hoda\u2019s \u201cdark period,\u201d Kotb\u2019s and Guthrie\u2019s production team found a way to retaliate. Savannah and Hoda mocked Megyn\u2019s infamously awkward exchange with entertainment industry legend Jane Fonda. Team Kotb\u2019s producers even turned to Twitter to post a link to the jab.\n\nJane Fonda had quite the response to Lily Tomlin's facelift comment pic.twitter.com/2qUUxReqiy \u2014 TODAY (@TODAYshow) January 16, 2018\n\nWhen Megyn interviewed Fonda, she asked about plastic surgery. Wrong question. Jane skillfully shut down Kelly by lecturing her, informing her that it was \u201cthe wrong time and place to ask that question.\u201d\n\nHoda and Savannah made it clear that they remembered and treasured Fonda\u2019s clap-back at Megyn. When Fonda showed up during Kotb\u2019s and Guthrie\u2019s Today show time slot with her buddy Lily Tomlin, Hoda asked how long their friendship had lasted.\n\n\u201cFifty years \u2014 a long time,\u201d said Jane.\n\nTomlin teased that the two had become acquainted prior to her \u201cfirst face-lift.\u201d Fonda had the perfect response.\n\n\u201c\u2018Who are you? Megyn Kelly?\u2019 joked Jane Fonda.\u201d\n\nGuthrie and Kotb couldn\u2019t stop laughing, while responses to the tweeted clip from Team Hoda showed that viewers were in on the jab at Kelly.\n\n\u201cOMG I just peed laughing at your avi!! ROFLMFAO good one!\u201d\n\nAs for what might happen next, look for Megyn Kelly to be faced with additional changes at Today, predicted Radar Online. Challenged by bad ratings, some producers reportedly want to change Kelly\u2019s time slot and move up Hoda\u2019s and Kathie Lee\u2019s hour.\n\nIn addition, with Kotb and Guthrie headed to the Olympics to broadcast the Today show live, both Gifford and Kelly are likely to be affected. Kathie Lee will be co-hosting without Hoda, while Radar Online pointed out that Megyn will remain in New York with \u201cno hour to host at all.\u201d"}

Brad\u2019s reportedly been secretly chatting with his ex, Jennifer Aniston, and Angie\u2019s allegedly \u2018enraged.\u2019 Will the kids be spending time with Jen?!..\n\nAlthough Angelina Jolie, 41, and Brad Pitt, 53, opted to make their legal docs involving their split completely private on Jan. 10, 2017, Angie\u2019s reportedly got a new demand to add to their split negotiations. She doesn\u2019t want Brad\u2019s reported new texting buddy, Jennifer Aniston, 48, anywhere near her kids, according to In Touch.\n\n\u201cAs Angie and Brad\u2019s divorce talks continue, she\u2019s demanding that Brad agree to never have their children around Jen,\u201d the mag reported. Brad and Angie share six children together \u2014 Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 8.\n\nThe actor has reportedly been leaning on his ex-wife while he deals with his emotional split from Angie. He and Jen married in July 2000 and ended their courtship in Oct. 2005 after he met Angie on the set of their love, action flick, Mr & Mrs. Smith. However, he\u2019s reportedly reconciled with Jen via phone. The two have allegedly been exchanging sweet messages over various phone calls and text messages, according to the mag. To make matters worse, Angie apparently knows about Brad and Jen\u2019s alleged newfound relationship and she\u2019s not happy whatsoever.\n\nAs for Brad\u2019s take on Angie\u2019s reported request that he should keep Jen far away from their six children? \u2014 \u201cBrad thinks the request is off the wall and irrational,\u201d the mag reported.

As a matter of fact, Angie always feared that Brad would go back with Jen. Wow.\n\nThings haven\u2019t been going too well for Brad throughout his nasty split with Angie. When she filed for divorce on Sept. 19, 2016, she also requested sole physical custody of their six children. Brad and Angie reached a private, temporary custody agreement on Sept. 30, which granted her full physical custody, and him with visitation approved by a therapist.\n\nAfter multiple disputes between the couple in scathing court docs, they decided to release a joint statement on Jan. 10, 2017, which revealed that they agreed to keep their court docs private. Since then, the exes have remained tight-lipped on the status of their broken marriage.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Brad and Jennifer are really texting?"}

For the Australian boxer, see Brad Pitt (boxer)\n\nWilliam Bradley \"Brad\" Pitt (born December 18, 1963) is an American actor and film producer. He has received multiple awards and nominations including an Academy Award as producer under his own company Plan B Entertainment.\n\nPitt first gained recognition as a cowboy hitchhiker in the road movie Thelma & Louise (1991). His first leading roles in big-budget productions came with the drama films A River Runs Through It (1992) and Legends of the Fall (1994), and horror film Interview with the Vampire (1994). He gave critically acclaimed performances in the crime thriller Seven and the science fiction film 12 Monkeys (both 1995), the latter earning him a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor and an Academy Award nomination.\n\nPitt starred in the cult film Fight Club (1999) and the heist film Ocean's Eleven (2001) and its sequels, Ocean's Twelve (2004) and Ocean's Thirteen (2007). His greatest commercial successes have been Troy (2004), Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005), and World War Z (2013).

He produced The Departed (2006) and 12 Years a Slave (2013), both of which won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and also The Tree of Life, Moneyball, and The Big Short (2015), all of which garnered Best Picture nominations.\n\nAs a public figure, Pitt has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, he was cited as the world's most attractive man by various media outlets, and his personal life is the subject of wide publicity. Divorced from actress Jennifer Aniston after five years of marriage, he married actress Angelina Jolie in 2014. They have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally. In 2016, Jolie filed for a divorce from Pitt, which is currently pending.[2]\n\nEarly life\n\nWilliam Bradley Pitt was born in Shawnee, Oklahoma, to William Alvin Pitt, who ran a trucking company, and Jane Etta (n\u00e9e Hillhouse), a school counsellor.[3][4] The family soon moved to Springfield, Missouri, where he lived together with his younger siblings, Douglas (born 1966) and Julie Neal (born 1969).[5] Born into a conservative household,[6] he was raised as Southern Baptist, but has since stated that he does not \"have a great relationship with religion\" and that he \"oscillate[s] between agnosticism and atheism\".[7] Pitt has described Springfield as \"Mark Twain country, Jesse James country\", having grown up with \"a lot of hills, a lot of lakes\".[8]\n\nPitt attended Kickapoo High School, where he was a member of the golf, swimming and tennis teams.[9] He participated in the school's Key and Forensics clubs, in school debates, and in musicals.[10] Following his graduation from high school, Pitt enrolled in the University of Missouri in 1982, majoring in journalism with a focus on advertising.[10] As graduation approached, Pitt did not feel ready to settle down. He loved films\u2014\"a portal into different worlds for me\"\u2014and, since films were not made in Missouri, he decided to go to where they were made.[11][12] Two weeks before earning his degree, Pitt left the university and moved to Los Angeles, where he took acting lessons and worked odd jobs.[11] He has named his early acting heroes as Gary Oldman, Sean Penn and Mickey Rourke.[13]\n\nCareer\n\n1987\u20131993: Early work\n\nWhile struggling to establish himself in Los Angeles, Pitt took lessons from acting coach Roy London.[10][14] Pitt's acting career began in 1987, with uncredited parts in the films No Way Out (1987), No Man's Land (1987) and Less Than Zero (1987).[10][15] In May 1987, his television debut came with a two-episode role on the NBC soap opera Another World.[16] In November of the same year, Pitt had a guest appearance on the ABC sitcom Growing Pains.[17] He appeared in four episodes of the CBS primetime series Dallas between December 1987 and February 1988 as Randy, the boyfriend of Charlie Wade (played by Shalane McCall).[18] Later in 1988, Pitt made a guest appearance on the Fox police drama 21 Jump Street.[19] In the same year, the Yugoslavian\u2013U.S. co-production The Dark Side of the Sun (1988) gave Pitt his first leading film role, as a young American taken by his family to the Adriatic to find a remedy for a skin condition. The film was shelved at the outbreak of the Croatian War of Independence, and was not released until 1997.[10] Pitt made two motion picture appearances in 1989: the first in a supporting role in the comedy Happy Together; the second a featured role in the horror film Cutting Class, the first of Pitt's films to reach theaters.[17] He made guest appearances on television series Head of the Class, Freddy's Nightmares, Thirtysomething, and (for a second time) Growing Pains.[20]\n\nPitt was cast as Billy Canton, a drug addict who takes advantage of a young runaway (played by Juliette Lewis) in the 1990 NBC television movie Too Young to Die?, the story of an abused teenager sentenced to death for a murder.[21] Ken Tucker, television reviewer for Entertainment Weekly wrote: \"Pitt is a magnificent slimeball as her hoody boyfriend; looking and sounding like a malevolent John Cougar Mellencamp, he's really scary.\"[21] The same year, Pitt co-starred in six episodes of the short-lived Fox drama Glory Days and took a supporting role in the HBO television film The Image.[22] His next appearance came in the 1991 film Across the Tracks; Pitt portrayed Joe Maloney, a high school runner with a criminal brother, played by Rick Schroder.[23] After years of supporting roles in film and frequent television guest appearances, Pitt attracted wider recognition in his supporting role in Ridley Scott's 1991 road film Thelma & Louise.[22] He played J.D., a small-time criminal who befriends Thelma (Geena Davis). His love scene with Davis has been cited as the event that defined Pitt as a sex symbol.[17][24] After Thelma & Louise, Pitt starred in the 1991 film Johnny Suede, a low-budget picture about an aspiring rock star,[25] and the 1992 live-action/animated fantasy film Cool World,[17] although neither furthered his career, having poor reviews and box office performance.[26][27]\n\nPitt took the role of Paul Maclean in the 1992 biographical film A River Runs Through It, directed by Robert Redford.[28] His portrayal of the character was described by People's Janet Mock as a career-making performance,[29] proving that Pitt could be more than a \"cowboy-hatted hunk.\"[30] He has admitted to feeling under pressure when making the film[5] and thought it one of his \"weakest performances ... It's so weird that it ended up being the one that I got the most attention for.\"[5] Pitt believed that he benefited from working with such a talented cast and crew. He compared working with Redford to playing tennis with a superior player, saying \"when you play with somebody better than you, your game gets better.\"[29][30] In 1993, Pitt reunited with Juliette Lewis for the road film Kalifornia. He played Early Grayce, a serial killer and the boyfriend of Lewis's character in a performance described by Peter Travers of Rolling Stone as \"outstanding, all boyish charm and then a snort that exudes pure menace.\"[31] Pitt also garnered attention for a brief appearance in the cult hit True Romance as a stoner named Floyd, providing much needed comic relief to the action film.[32] He capped the year by winning a ShoWest Award for Male Star of Tomorrow.[33]\n\n1994\u20131998: Breakthrough\n\n1994 marked a significant turning point in Pitt's career. Starring as the vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac in the horror film Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles, based on Anne Rice's 1976 novel of the same name,[34] he was part of an ensemble cast that included Tom Cruise, Kirsten Dunst, Christian Slater, and Antonio Banderas.[34] Despite his winning two MTV Movie Awards at the 1995 ceremony,[35] his performance was poorly received. According to the Dallas Observer, \"Brad Pitt [...] is a large part of the problem [in the film]. When directors play up his cocky, hunkish, folksy side [...] he's a joy to watch. But there's nothing about him that suggests inner torment or even self-awareness, which makes him a boring Louis.\"[36] Following the release of Interview with the Vampire, Pitt starred in Legends of the Fall (1994),[37] based on a novel by the same name by Jim Harrison, set in the American West during the first four decades of the twentieth century. Portraying Tristan Ludlow, son of Colonel William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) a Cornish immigrant,[38] Pitt received his first Golden Globe Award nomination, in the Best Actor category.[39] Aidan Quinn and Henry Thomas co-starred as Pitt's brothers. Although the film's reception was mixed,[40] many film critics praised Pitt's performance. Janet Maslin of The New York Times said, \"Pitt's diffident mix of acting and attitude works to such heartthrob perfection it's a shame the film's superficiality gets in his way.\"[41] The Deseret News predicted that Legends of the Fall would solidify Pitt's reputation as a lead actor.[42]\n\nIn 1995, Pitt starred alongside Morgan Freeman and Gwyneth Paltrow in the crime thriller Seven, playing a detective on the trail of a serial killer.[43] Pitt called it a great movie and declared the part would expand his acting horizons.[44] He expressed his intent to move on from \"this 'pretty boy' thing [...] and play someone with flaws.\"[45] His performance was critically well received, with Variety saying that it was screen acting at its best, further remarking on Pitt's ability to turn in a \"determined, energetic, creditable job\" as the detective.[46] Seven earned $327 million at the international box office.[26] Following the success of Seven, Pitt took a supporting role as Jeffrey Goines in Terry Gilliam's 1995 science-fiction film 12 Monkeys. The movie received predominantly positive reviews, with Pitt praised in particular. Janet Maslin of the New York Times called Twelve Monkeys \"fierce and disturbing\" and remarked on Pitt's \"startlingly frenzied performance\", concluding that he \"electrifies Jeffrey with a weird magnetism that becomes important later in the film.\"[47] He won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor for the film[39] and received his first Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.[48]\n\nThe following year he had a role in the legal drama Sleepers (1996), based on Lorenzo Carcaterra's novel of the same name.[49] The film received mixed reviews.[50] In the 1997 film The Devil's Own Pitt starred, opposite Harrison Ford, as the Irish Republican Army terrorist Rory Devany,[51] a role for which he was required to learn an Irish accent.[52] Critical opinion was divided on his accent; \"Pitt finds the right tone of moral ambiguity, but at times his Irish brogue is too convincing \u2013 it's hard to understand what he's saying\", wrote the San Francisco Chronicle.[53] The Charleston Gazette opined that it had favored Pitt's accent over the movie.[54] The Devil's Own grossed $140 million worldwide,[26] but was a critical failure. Later that year he led as Austrian mountaineer Heinrich Harrer in the Jean-Jacques Annaud film Seven Years in Tibet.[55] Pitt trained for months for the role, which demanded significant mountain climbing and trekking practice, including rock climbing in California and the European Alps with his co-star David Thewlis.[56] The film received mostly negative reviews, and was generally considered a disappointment.[57] Pitt had the lead role in 1998's fantasy romance film Meet Joe Black. He portrayed a personification of death inhabiting the body of a young man to learn what it is like to be human.[58] The film received mixed reviews, and many were critical of Pitt's performance. According to Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle, Pitt was unable to \"make an audience believe that he knows all the mysteries of death and eternity.\"[59] Roger Ebert stated \"Pitt is a fine actor, but this performance is a miscalculation.\"[60]\n\n1999\u20132003\n\nIn 1999, Pitt portrayed Tyler Durden in Fight Club,[61][62] a film adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name, directed by David Fincher.[63] Pitt prepared for the part with lessons in boxing, taekwondo, and grappling.[64] To look the part, Pitt consented to the removal of pieces of his front teeth which were restored when filming ended.[65] While promoting Fight Club, Pitt said that the film explored not taking one's aggressions out on someone else but to \"have an experience, take a punch more and see how you come out on the other end.\"[66] Fight Club premiered at the 1999 Venice International Film Festival.[67] Despite divided critical opinion on the film as a whole,[68][69] Pitt's performance was widely praised. Paul Clinton of CNN noted the risky yet successful nature of the film,[70] while Variety remarked upon Pitt's ability to be \"cool, charismatic and more dynamically physical, perhaps than [...] his breakthrough role in Thelma and Louise\".[71] In spite of a worse-than-expected box office performance, Fight Club became a cult classic after its DVD release in 2000.[72]\n\nPitt in December 2001\n\nPitt was cast as an Irish Gypsy boxer with a barely intelligible accent in Guy Ritchie's 2000 gangster film Snatch.[73] Several reviewers were critical of Snatch; however, most praised Pitt.[74] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said Pitt was \"ideally cast as an Irishman whose accent is so thick even Brits can't understand him\", going on to say that, before Snatch, Pitt had been \"shackled by roles that called for brooding introspection, but recently he has found his calling in black comic outrageousness and flashy extroversion;\"[75] while Amy Taubin of The Village Voice claimed that \"Pitt gets maximum comic mileage out of a one-joke role\".[76] The following year Pitt starred opposite Julia Roberts in the romantic comedy The Mexican,[77] a film that garnered a range of reviews[78] but enjoyed box office success.[26] Pitt's next role, in 2001's $143 million-grossing Cold War thriller Spy Game,[26] was as Tom Bishop, an operative of the CIA's Special Activities Division, mentored by Robert Redford's character.[79] Mark Holcomb of Salon.com enjoyed the film, although he noted that neither Pitt nor Redford provided \"much of an emotional connection for the audience\".[80]\n\nOn November 22, 2001, Pitt made a guest appearance in the eighth season of the television series Friends, playing a man with a grudge against Rachel Green, played by Jennifer Aniston, to whom Pitt was married at the time.[81] For this performance he was nominated for an Emmy Award in the category of Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.[82] In December 2001, Pitt played Rusty Ryan in the heist film Ocean's Eleven, a remake of the 1960 Rat Pack original. He joined an ensemble cast including George Clooney, Matt Damon, Andy Garc\u00eda, and Julia Roberts.[83] Well received by critics, Ocean's Eleven was highly successful at the box office, earning $450 million worldwide.[26] Pitt appeared in two episodes of MTV's reality series Jackass in February 2002, first running through the streets of Los Angeles with several cast members in gorilla suits,[84] and participating in his own staged abduction in another episode.[85] In the same year, Pitt had a cameo role in George Clooney's directorial debut Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.[86] He took on his first voice-acting roles in 2003, speaking as the titular character of the DreamWorks animated film Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas[87] and playing Boomhauer's brother, Patch, in an episode of the animated television series King of the Hill.[88]\n\n2004\u20132013\n\nPitt had two major film roles in 2004, starring as Achilles in Troy, and reprising his role, Rusty Ryan, in the sequel Ocean's Twelve. He spent six months sword training before the filming of Troy, based on the Iliad.[89] An on-set injury to his Achilles tendon delayed production on the picture for several weeks.[90] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Times stated that Pitt excelled at such a demanding role.[91] Troy was the first film produced by Plan B Entertainment, a film production company he had founded two years earlier with Jennifer Aniston and Brad Grey, CEO of Paramount Pictures.[92] Ocean's Twelve earned $362 million worldwide,[26] and Pitt and Clooney's dynamic was described by CNN's Paul Clinton as \"the best male chemistry since Paul Newman and Robert Redford.\"[93] In 2005, Pitt starred in the Doug Liman-directed action comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith, in which a bored married couple discover that each is an assassin sent to kill the other. The feature received reasonable reviews but was generally lauded for the chemistry between Pitt and Angelina Jolie, who played his character's wife Jane Smith. The Star Tribune noted that \"while the story feels haphazard, the movie gets by on gregarious charm, galloping energy and the stars' thermonuclear screen chemistry\".[94] Mr. & Mrs. Smith earned $478 million worldwide, making it one of the biggest hits of 2005.[95]\n\nBurn After Reading premiere in August 2008 Pitt at thepremiere in August 2008\n\nFor his next film, Pitt starred opposite Cate Blanchett in Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's multi-narrative drama Babel (2006).[96] Pitt's performance was critically well-received, and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer said that he was credible and gave the film visibility.[97] Pitt later said he regarded taking the part as one of the best decisions of his career.[98] The film was screened at a special presentation at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival[99] and was later featured at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival.[100] Babel received seven Academy and Golden Globe award nominations, winning the Best Drama Golden Globe, and earned Pitt a nomination for the Best Supporting Actor Golden Globe.[39] That same year, Pitt's company Plan B Entertainment produced The Departed, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Pitt was credited on-screen as a producer; however, only Graham King was ruled eligible for the Oscar win.[101]\n\nReprising his role as Rusty Ryan in a third picture, Pitt starred in 2007's Ocean's Thirteen.[102] While less lucrative than the first two films, this sequel earned $311 million at the international box office.[26] Pitt's next film role was as American outlaw Jesse James in the 2007 Western drama The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, adapted from Ron Hansen's 1983 novel of the same name.[103] Directed by Andrew Dominik and produced by Pitt's company Plan B Entertainment, the film premiered at the 2007 Venice Film Festival,[104] with Pitt playing a \"scary and charismatic\" role, according to Lewis Beale of Film Journal International,[105] and earning Pitt the Volpi Cup award for Best Actor at the 64th Venice International Film Festival.[106] He eventually collected the award one year later at the 2008 festival.[107]\n\nPitt's next appearance was in the 2008 black comedy Burn After Reading, his first collaboration with the Coen brothers. The film received a positive reception from critics, with The Guardian calling it \"a tightly wound, slickly plotted spy comedy\",[108] noting that Pitt's performance was one of the funniest.[108] He was later cast as Benjamin Button, the lead in David Fincher's 2008 film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, a loosely adapted version of a 1921 short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The story follows a man who is born an octogenarian and ages in reverse,[109] with Pitt's \"sensitive\" performance making Benjamin Button a \"timeless masterpiece\", according to Michael Sragow of The Baltimore Sun.[110] The performance earned Pitt his first Screen Actors Guild Award nomination,[111] as well as a fourth Golden Globe and second Academy Award nomination,[39][112] all in the category for Best Actor. The film received thirteen Academy Award nominations in total, and grossed $329 million at the box office worldwide.[26]\n\nPitt's next leading role came in 2009 with the Quentin Tarantino-directed war film Inglourious Basterds, which premiered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival.[113] Pitt played Lieutenant Aldo Raine, an American resistance fighter battling Nazis in German-occupied France.[114] The film was a box office hit, taking $311 million worldwide,[26] and garnered generally favorable reviews.[115] The film received multiple awards and nominations, including eight Academy Award nominations and seven MTV Movie Award nominations, including Best Male Performance for Pitt.[116][117] He next voiced the superhero character Metro Man in the 2010 animated feature Megamind.[118] Pitt produced and appeared in Terrence Malick's experimental drama The Tree of Life, co-starring Sean Penn, which won the Palme d'Or at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival.[119] In a performance that attracted strong praise, he portrayed the Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane in the drama Moneyball, which is based on the 2003 book of the same name written by Michael Lewis.[120] Moneyball received six Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and Best Actor for Pitt.[121]\n\nHis next role was as mob hitman Jackie Cogan in Andrew Dominik's 2012 Killing Them Softly, based on the novel Cogan's Trade by George V.

Numerous publications have been circulating details about how the pair will supposedly reunite on-screen with a romantic comedy project, for example. There have also been reports of the two getting married. As it turns out, neither of these is true.\n\nListing a variety of rumors and reports that it considers false, Gossip Cop has certainly gone out of its way to try and prove other publications wrong. The stated fictional declarations on that list include the supposed secret Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt marriage and that the pair is engaged once again.\n\nApparently, publications have been taking the smallest details to spin a narrative that was nowhere close to the truth. For example, a snapshot of the \u201cFriends\u201d actress wearing a ring for the movie she was shooting called \u201cMurder Mystery\u201d was mistaken for an engagement ring. This was quickly picked up and circulated all over the web, leading to a Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt rumor feeding frenzy.\n\nThere were also some reports about the former married couple tying the knot once more to celebrate what would have been their 18th wedding anniversary. As Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt rumors go, this one might just be one of the most misleading.\n\nThe part about the two actors being in a romantic-comedy has also been debunked recently by Gossip Cop, as well, which was reposted by MSN. Neither of the Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt parties had shown any indication that such a rumor was even close to being true. In fact, past discussions alluding to the same topic have been denied by spokespersons of the actors before.\n\nFor Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt news that does come with evidence, it would seem that the \u201cFight Club\u201d actor likes to model his look after whoever he is currently dating.

They both have amazing careers that take them from place to place, so to be able to do it together and to bring the whole family with them makes it less stressful on everyone. It\u2019ll be nice not having to call each other or FaceTime each other when they will be sharing a tour bus together instead. It\u2019s clearly a family first tour, so they are excited for it all to unfold and want to have as much fun as possible,\u201d a source close to the couple tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\nIsn\u2019t that so sweet? This time around, their work schedules won\u2019t take them away from each other, nor their kids. Beyonce, 36, and JAY-Z, 48, are planning on bringing Blue Ivy, 6, as well as twins Rumi and Sir, both 9 months, along for the ride when their tour kicks off on June 6, and we couldn\u2019t be more thrilled for them.

The ticket pre-sale will go live on Wednesday, March 14 at 9:00 AM North American local time, and 10:00 AM European local time. Get more info on how to sign up for the pre-sale here.\n\nWe must note, this will be Beyonce and JAY-Z\u2019s first tour since welcoming Rumi and Sir into the world on June 13, 2017, so it\u2019ll be really special to share this moment in their careers with their children. And the tour will kick off after Beyonce\u2019s highly-publicized performance at Coachella in April. As you\u2019ll recall, she cancelled last year\u2019s performance due to her unexpected pregnancy with the twins. To see all the tour dates for OTR II, click here."}

'A child's experience between 8 and 12 is really going to impact them as a teen and as an adult.\n\n'They're figuring out their sexuality, as well as relationships between men and women.

He was the grandest of men.\u201d \u2014 Tom Hanks\n\n\u201cI am heart-broken to lose a friend, a mentor, a guy so singular and dynamic you\u2019d have to design a hurricane to contain him. Jonathan was as quirky as his comedies and as deep as his dramas. He was pure energy, the unstoppable cheerleader for anyone creative. Just as passionate about music as he was about art, he was and will always be a champion of the soul. JD, most beloved, something wild, brother of love, director of the lambs. Love that guy.

My condolences to his family.\u201d \u2014 Anthony Hopkins\n\n\u201cJonathan Demme came into my life when he directed me in Melvin and Howard. I won an Oscar for that role and I can\u2019t imagine that having happened with any other director. He was pure magic. Brilliant technically but he never let that make him isolated. He included everyone on that set in the making of the movie in the most edgy, thrilling, wildly collaborative way. He did the same thing in Philadelphia. And, there, we never forgot for a moment that that film could change the experience of being HIV positive in this country and it did. The heartbeat and the integrity of it began with Jonathan\u2019s goodness and sense of justice. I\u2019m so proud to have been in it.\n\nI think the last public appearance he may have made was to host the NYC screening of my son, Charlie McDowell\u2019s film, The Discovery. It can\u2019t have been easy for him to go to NYC from Nyack and do that a couple of weeks before his death. But Jonathan celebrated and honored creativity more fiercely than anyone I have ever known. My daughter worked with him in The Manchurian Candidate. We all admired him so much. I send all of our family\u2019s love to his beautiful family and I will hold him where he\u2019s always been, in my heart, forever.\u201d \u2014 Mary Steenburgen\n\n\u201cWhenever I ran into Jonathan, he was filled with enthusiasm and excitement about a new project. He took so much joy in moviemaking. His pictures have an inner lyricism that just lifts them off the ground \u2014 even a story like The Silence of the Lambs. I have great admiration for Jonathan as a filmmaker \u2014 I love the freshness of his style and his excellent use of music, from Buddy Holly to Miklos Rozsa. There\u2019s so much more to be said, and I hardly know where to begin. I also loved him as a friend, and to me he was always young. My young friend.

Please don't sue us!\n\nAnyway, sources say that in the years after her split from Cruise, Katie pretty much holed up and devoted herself thoroughly to being a mom.\n\nThese days, she's loosening up a bit, and her loved ones credit Foxx with teaching her how to relax and have fun.\n\n\u201cShe was a homebody,\u201d says one insider.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see her out and having fun, and I bet Jamie has played a big part in that.\u201d\n\nHopefully, the knowledge that everyone will now be scrutinizing her midsection in search of a baby bump won't stop Katie from continuing to go out and enjoy herself."}

{"label": false, "txt": "Two blacked-out limousines swish to a halt outside a modest three-bedroom house on the flats of Beverly Hills. Paint peeling from the walls, rubbish bins left outside on the street\u2026 it is the last place on Earth you'd expect to see two of the biggest stars on the planet.\n\nFrom one car emerges Angelina Jolie, her face devoid of make-up, long hair pulled back into a severe ponytail. Moments later, her estranged husband Brad Pitt steps out of the second vehicle and hurries quickly up the tarmac drive.\n\nIt was then, just seven weeks ago, that 'Brangelina', as the world has come to know Hollywood's the most famous couple, stood face-to-face for the first time in ten months. 'Brad took the first step forward,' says the couple's biographer Ian Halperin. 'Then they collapsed into each other's arms.'\n\nTempestuous relationships: Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor in 1969 during the first of their two marriages. Right: Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie at the 2014 Oscars, two years before their marital bust-up\n\nThe stars, safely away from prying eyes at the home of a friend, then went inside for an emotional heart-to-heart that put aside the months of acrimony and mud-slinging that destroyed the fairytale image of the couple who fell passionately in love on the set of the 2005 film Mr & Mrs Smith.\n\n'There were a lot of tears,' Halperin adds. 'Nothing was left on the table. They had it out, right there and then in this very modest house. In that moment they decided to make a fresh start. It was a 'come to Jesus meeting' that marked the beginning of a new phase in their relationship.'\n\nWhen the couple split last September amid toxic allegations of drink, drugs and a mid-air altercation between Pitt and their teenage son Maddox \u2013 which resulted in brief investigations by the FBI and social services \u2013 the rift in their relationship seemed as final as it was sudden.\n\nBut the 'tough love' meeting arranged by the couple's divorce negotiator gave them a chance to talk in the presence of a 'referee' who helped them cut through the acrimony and recrimination. Their conclusion was that, like a latter-day Liz Taylor and Richard Burton, they still loved each other and wanted to try again.\n\nOn-screen chemistry: Pitt and Jolie, left, in 2005\u2019s Mr & Mrs Smith \u2013 the pair reportedly fell in love on the set. Right: Burton and Taylor in the 1962 classic Cleopatra\n\nToday, The Mail on Sunday can reveal that they are, in fact, working to 'consciously re-couple' and have undergone intensive rehab and spiritual counselling sessions in an effort to start anew.\n\nTogether with their six children, three biological and three adopted, 'Brangelina' have long been considered the most passionate \u2013 and lucrative \u2013 showbusiness couple since Burton and Taylor, whose tempestuous relationship famously resulted in two marriages and two divorces in the 1960s and 1970s. Indeed, there are remarkable parallels. When the Brangelina marriage imploded spectacularly a year ago, few thought it could recover.\n\n'Angie was very, very angry about the incident on the private plane between Brad and Maddox,' says Halperin, whose new documentary, Broken: The Incredible Story Of Brangelina, will be broadcast in the UK later this year. 'She threw everything she had at him\n\n'It was toxic. I've spoken to many people around them, friends and family, and no one could see how they could possibly recover. But both of them realise they are happier together than apart. Once they cleared the air between them, things started to improve.\n\nToday, they are both feeling very positive. Angelina sees them as very much the new Burton and Taylor. They can't live together but they can't live apart. She has worked hard on herself since the plane incident, and so has Brad. They are still in love with each other.'\n\nIndeed, the couple have even joked they are 'consciously re-coupling', a tongue-in-cheek reference to Gwyneth Paltrow's famous and much ridiculed comment when she and Coldplay singer Chris Martin split in 2014 that they were 'consciously uncoupling'.\n\nHalperin says sources within the Brangelina camp have even told him the divorce may still go ahead, but that 'a piece of paper' means little to the couple.\n\n'Angie believes everything started to go wrong after they tied the knot. Their relationship shifted, it became boring. Brad's drinking escalated. They both had heavy work schedules and they were constantly travelling around as a family. Tensions grew.\n\nThey both view divorce as not the worst thing that can happen. It's only a piece of paper and they feel once the divorce is done, they have a clean sheet and can start their lives anew.'\n\nIndeed, the pair, who met when Pitt was still married to Friends star Jennifer Aniston, are 'sexual dynamite', according to one source. 'That powerful sexual attraction never wavered. Even when they were having the worst fights, they would always kiss and make up. They were happier before marriage. They only married because the kids begged them to. Now they realise what a mistake that was.'\n\nPax Jolie-Pitt, Vivienne Jolie-Pitt, Angelina Jolie, Shiloh Jolie-Pitt, Maddox Jolie-Pitt, Knox Jolie-Pitt, Zahara Jolie-Pitt, Brad Pitt in 2015\n\nBoth sides have insisted on certain conditions for the relationship to be given a second chance. The constant presence of Jolie's brother James Haven, whom she once kissed on the lips at the Oscars, is said by friends to have inflamed the marital discord\n\n'James was the 'manny'. He was at the marital home 24/7 and became a de facto father figure to the kids which Brad, a traditionalist, didn't take well to at all,' explains Halperin, who spent five years working on his definitive bestselling 2010 biography of the couple, Brangelina: The Untold Story.\n\nAlso to be sidelined is Jolie's 'British coven': Baroness Arminka Helic and Chloe Dalton, who both worked for ex-Tory leader William Hague and who became close to Jolie through her UN philanthropic work. 'They are strong, powerful women who exercised undue influence on her,' a friend of Pitt said. 'Brad felt they meddled in the marriage.\n\n'The endless travelling is also going to stop. Brad already has unlimited access to the children and he has vowed to be a more active and present father. They both want to be there for their kids and, of course, the children want nothing more than to see their parents reunite,' says Halperin.\n\nBoth have made a fresh start geographically. Jolie recently moved into a \u00a319 million mansion in Los Feliz, an area of Los Angeles more arty and less stuffy than the traditional environs of Beverly Hills, where the couple's \u00a315 million marital home sits empty.\n\nBurton and Taylor with their children in 1967. Both Pitt and Jolie have insisted on certain conditions for the relationship to be given a second chance\n\nJolie's new home once belonged to one of the 'founders' of modern Hollywood, studio boss Cecil B. DeMille. It enjoys panoramic views over the city and boasts six bedrooms, ten bathrooms and 2.1 acres of gardens.\n\nPitt, meanwhile, is living in a relatively modest \u00a31 million bungalow close to Jolie's new digs and is said to be employing a 'sober coach' to be with him 24/7.\n\nHalperin says friends have seen a 'radical shift' in 42-year-old Jolie, a woman who has openly admitted suffering emotional trauma from her own parents' divorce when she was just three years old, causing a 'downward spiral' into heroin addiction and eating disorders.\n\nHer mother Marcheline, to whom she was extremely close, died of cancer in 2007, and Angelina was estranged from her actor father Jon Voight for many years until, at the urging of Pitt, the pair reconciled 18 months ago. Jolie was photographed with Voight last month taking nine-year-old daughter Vivienne to an art shop.\n\nIn a recent interview with Vanity Fair magazine, the actress said she and the children \u2013 Maddox, 16, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, and nine-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne \u2013 had been going through 'the hardest time', adding: 'We're all trying our best to heal our family.'\n\nConsidering both are now the most eligible singles in Hollywood, neither appears to have actively sought out a new partner. Pitt, 53, was spotted cosying up to Sienna Miller at Glastonbury this summer but both denied any romance.\n\n'Brad hasn't got eyes for anyone else and nor has Angie,' says Halperin. When they split, Jolie's team set out to paint Pitt as a villain. 'They ran a smear campaign,' says one insider.\n\nPitt was accused of having an affair with Allied co-star Marion Cotillard, an allegation both vehemently denied. 'Angie's anger has gone,' says Halperin. 'She's starting to realise Brad's a great dad and a great man.\n\n'The main issue in the marriage was Brad's drinking and pot-smoking,' he adds. 'One of the things that has impressed Angie the most has been his commitment to getting clean and sober.'\n\nIn an interview with GQ magazine, a visibly shaken Pitt took 'full responsibility' for the marriage breakdown, blaming his dependence on alcohol and marijuana for the explosive row with 16-year-old Maddox. He cut a much slimmer figure as he started work in LA on a new film a few days ago, the \u00a335 million sci-fi thriller Ad Astra.\n\nJolie, meanwhile, has been paying thrice-weekly visits to a Beverly Hills 'spiritual counsellor'.\n\n'The Angelina of today is in the best place ever,' a source close to the star said. 'She's calm, less prone to erratic behaviour, and open to making the relationship with Brad her priority. She adores him and always has. She wants her children to have the stability she never had.'\n\nThe pair, who own other homes in France, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, New Orleans and New York, also realise the value of 'brand Brangelina' \u2013 conservatively valued at more than \u00a3100 million, according to Forbes magazine.\n\n'They have always lived the high life and their earning potential as a couple far exceeds their potential as individuals,' adds Halperin. 'Money isn't high on the list of priorities for either of them, but avoiding a nasty fight over money is an added bonus. They've pretty much divided their marital assets evenly and are now back to being independent of each other financially.'\n\nWhatever happens, both stars believe their story is not over. 'Hollywood loves a 'happily ever after' ending,' says Halperin. 'And no one wants it more than Brad and Angie.'"}

She was ranked second on Forbes' list of the \"World's Top-Earning Models\". Forbes noted that since ending her 13-year run as a Victoria's Secret Angel, Klum has become more of a businesswoman than a model. In 2008, she became an American citizen while maintaining her native German citizenship.[6][7][8][9]\n\nEarly life and discovery [ edit ]\n\nKlum was born and raised in Bergisch Gladbach, a town outside Cologne, Germany. She is the daughter of Erna, a hairdresser,[10] and G\u00fcnther Klum,[11] a cosmetics company executive. A friend convinced her to enroll in a national modeling contest called \"Model 92\".[12] Out of 25,000 contestants, Klum was voted the winner on 29 April 1992, and offered a modeling contract worth US$300,000 by Thomas Zeumer, CEO of Metropolitan Models New York.[13] After winning, she appeared on the Gottschalk Late Night Show, a German television show with host Thomas Gottschalk. She accepted the contract a few months later after graduating from school and decided not to try for an apprentice position at a fashion design school.[14]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nModeling and acting [ edit ]\n\nKlum has been featured on the cover of French, German, Portuguese and Spanish Vogue magazines, as well as Elle, InStyle, Marie Claire, Glamour and Russian Harper's Bazaar magazines. She became widely known after appearing on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue and for her work with Victoria's Secret as an \"Angel\".[15] Klum hosted the 2002, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 Victoria's Secret Fashion Shows. On 1 October 2010, the New York Post reported in its \"Page Six\" gossip column that Klum would be leaving Victoria's Secret, which was later confirmed by Klum.[16]\n\nIn addition to working with well-known photographers on her first husband's Sports Illustrated shoots, she was the object and subject of Joanne Gair body painting works in several editions from 1997 to 2010. She wrote the foreword to Gair's book of body paint work, Body Painting, Masterpieces.[17] Klum was the face of Givenchy's Amarige fragrance, and she also served as a spokesmodel for McDonald's, Braun, Dannon, H & M, and Liz Claiborne. Since 2007, she has been a celebrity spokesmodel for Jordache[18] and Volkswagen. In addition to modeling, she has appeared in several TV shows, including Spin City, Sex and the City, Yes, Dear, and How I Met Your Mother. She had a role as an ill-tempered hair model in the movie Blow Dry, played a giantess in the movie Ella Enchanted and was cast as Ursula Andress in The Life and Death of Peter Sellers. She had cameo appearances in the films The Devil Wears Prada and Perfect Stranger. Her other projects include dance and video games. She is featured in the 2003 video game James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing, where she plays the villain Dr. Katya Nadanova.[19] She has appeared in several music videos, including Jamiroquai's video \"Love Foolosophy\" from their album A Funk Odyssey, Kelis's \"Young, Fresh n' New\", off her second 2001 album Wanderland and, most recently, the second video for her then husband Seal's song \"Secret\" off his 2010 album Seal 6: Commitment. The latter video depicts the married couple sharing intimate moments while naked in bed; the concept was Klum's idea.[20] In July 2007, having earned US$8 million in the previous 16 months, Klum was named by Forbes as third on the list of the World's 15 Top-Earning Supermodels.[21]\n\nIn 2008, Forbes estimated her income at US$16 million, putting Klum in first place. For 2007, Forbes estimated her income at US$14 million.[22] Klum is signed to IMG Models in New York City.[23] In 2008, Klum was a featured guest on an American Volkswagen commercial, where she was interviewed by a black Beetle. When she commented that German engineering is so sexy, she caused the Beetle to blush and turn red. She has been a part of several commercials for Volkswagen and McDonald's on German television.[24] In November 2008, Klum appeared in two versions of a Guitar Hero World Tour commercial, wherein she did a take on Tom Cruise's iconic underwear dancing scene in Risky Business. In both versions, she lip-synced to Bob Seger's \"Old Time Rock and Roll\" while dancing around the living room with the wireless guitar controller.[25]\n\nIn October 2009, Klum was the often-nude one-woman subject of Heidilicious,[26] a photo book by photographer Rankin. Klum ventured into web-based videos, starring in \"SPIKED HEEL: Supermodels Battle the Forces of Evil\". The web-series starred model Coco Rocha and was directed by fashion documentarian Doug Keeve. In the story, Klum aka 'The Kluminator,'[27] and her stylish sidekick Coco \"The Sassy Superhero\" Rocha battle the evil Dr. Faux Pas who is plotting to destroy Fashion Week. The heroines employ everything from blow-dryer guns to fist fights, in order to thwart Dr. Faux Pas' dastardly plans. The Kluminator and Girl Wonder avoid a chain of fashion disasters to neutralize a death ray that threatens to vaporize the community of fashionistas gathered in Bryant Park.[28] In 2010, Klum became the new face and creative advisor for European cosmetics brand Astor, for which she sets artistic direction and designs new products and fashion forward color collections.[29] In October 2010, Klum parted ways with Victoria's Secret after 13 years of working with the brand. She provided a simple explanation in her official statement, stating: \"All good things have to come to an end. I will always love Victoria and never tell her secret. It's been an absolute amazing time!\"[30]\n\nIt was reported in May 2011 that Klum ranked second with estimated earnings of US$20 million on Forbes' list of the World's Top-Earning Models (2010\u20132011). Forbes noted that since ending her 13-year run as a Victoria's Secret Angel, Klum has become more of a businesswoman than a model. She partnered with New Balance and Amazon.com to launch a clothing line and signed a 20-episode deal to host a new show on Lifetime, called Seriously Funny Kids.[31] In fact, some noted fashion designers have long been commenting on Klum's limited role as a fashion model. Karl Lagerfeld, for example, in 2009 agreed with German designer Wolfgang Joop, who called Klum after she had posed naked on the cover of the German edition of GQ magazine,[32] \"no runway model. She is simply too heavy and has too big a bust\".[33] Lagerfeld observed that neither he nor Claudia Schiffer knew Klum, as she has never worked in Paris and was insignificant in the world of fashion, being \"more bling bling and glamorous than current fashion.\"[34]\n\nProducing [ edit ]\n\nIn December 2004, Klum became the host, judge and executive producer of the reality show Project Runway on the U.S. cable television channel Bravo (airing on Lifetime television beginning in 2009), in which fashion designers compete for the opportunity to show their line at New York Fashion Week and receive money to launch their own fashion line. She received an Emmy Award nomination for the show for each of the first four seasons.[35][36] In 2008, Klum and Project Runway received a Peabody Award, the first time a reality show won the award.[37] Klum was nominated for an Emmy in 2008 for \"outstanding host of a reality or reality-competition show\" for Project Runway, the first year that category was recognized by the Emmys.[36] Klum has been the host, judge and co-producer of Germany's Next Topmodel, the German version of the internationally successful reality television show, since 2006. All twelve seasons aired on the German TV station ProSieben. In 2013, Klum, along with her co-host Tim Gunn won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program.[38]\n\nDesign and other business ventures [ edit ]\n\nKlum designed clothing lines (one for men), featured in the German mail-order catalog \"Otto\".

(Photo by James Devaney/GC Images) Jessica Simpson and Eric Johnson are not headed for a $1 billion divorce, despite a completely untrue report in one of this week\u2019s tabloids. Gossip Cop can exclusively debunk the supposed marital drama. A rep for the singer tells us the spouses are going strong, and there\u2019s plenty of additional evidence to\n\nAccording to OK!, however, the couple\u2019s four-year marriage is hanging by a thread due to \u201cJessica\u2019s partying and Eric\u2019s lack of interest\u201d in their relationship.\n\nAn alleged insider tells the magazine, \u201cThey\u2019re always clashing over all sorts of things. Friends are worried that Jessica and Eric may not make it through this.\u201d The outlet\u2019s questionable source goes on to say that the former NFL star is sick of his wife\u2019s \u201cantics\u201d and is \u201ctired of playing dad to their kids and his wife.\u201d\n\nThe seemingly phony tipster further maintains that Simpson and Johnson rarely spend time together and \u201cdon\u2019t actually have a lot in common apart from the kids.\u201d The singer\u2019s billion-dollar fashion empire may be at stake, according to the outlet\u2019s suspicious source, who adds, \u201cEric could go after everything Jessica has. This could turn into a brutal custody war, a battle for their mansion and Jessica\u2019s business.\u201d\n\nThe tabloid\u2019s take on the couple\u2019s marriage is coming from an anonymous \u201cinsider,\u201d but Simpson\u2019s spokesperson tells Gossip Cop on the record that she and her husband are very much in love. The claim that they don\u2019t spend time together is also provably untrue. On Wednesday, Simpson and Johnson were spotted on a date night in New York City. Simpson and her husband were also photographed walking arm-in-arm earlier that day.\n\nAdditionally, the singer frequently praises her husband on social media and documents the time they spend together and with their two children. Last month, Simpson shared an Instagram photo of Johnson holding up their kids, along with the caption, \u201cGod gave me life to live it with this man.\u201d Just a few days ago, Simpson and Johnson smiled for a selfie on a flight. And in mid-July, Simpson celebrated her 38th birthday with her husband in Los Angeles. Over the past few months alone, the singer has shared dozens of Instagram photos of date nights with her husband, family vacations and other outings.\n\nConclusion: Without a single shred of evidence, an alleged \u201csource\u201d tells OK! that Simpson and her husband are headed for an acrimonious divorce that will put her fortune at stake. Not only does the singer\u2019s rep deny the claim, but there\u2019s a trail of evidence on her social media page to disprove it. In addition to Simpson\u2019s own collection of pictures with her husband, the two are frequently photographed looking happy on date nights and day outings. It\u2019s clear there\u2019s no billion-dollar divorce on the horizon.\n\nRelated slideshow: George, Amal Clooney getting $1 billion divorce and more tabloid tales"}

{"label": false, "txt": "It's been a pretty surprising last few days for fans of Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez, AKA Jelena. Many rooting for the on-again, off-again couple to get back together once and for all are probably just a tad bit shattered now that it's been confirmed that Bieber and Hailey Baldwin are engaged to be married after Bieber's proposal on July 7 during a trip to the Bahamas. But, while we're all over here mourning the loss of the couple that we thought would be endgame, our girl Selena is literally the epitome of the shrugged-shoulders emoji, clearly not caring as much as we all thought she would. And honestly, Selena Gomez's reaction to Justin Bieber's engagement confirmation will probably make you love her even more than you already do, if that's possible.\n\nAccording to E! News, a source told the publication that, although the news of Bieber and Baldwin's engagement was unexpected, Gomez \"doesn't really care\" about her ex-boyfriend's new romance. The source said,\n\nSelena was surprised an engagement happened this quickly but not surprised Justin would do something like this knowing who he is. At the end of the day though she doesn't really care. Selena is totally over him. She had tried again to make it work that last time and it didn't work out.\n\nElite Daily reached out to Gomez's team regarding the report, but has not heard back by the time of publication.\n\nLe sigh. For everyone who knew Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez's relationship, it's a bit sad to hear that these two clearly aren't getting back together, but perhaps that's for the best, considering they are in completely different phases of their lives right now.\n\nCraig Barritt/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nThe source continued, saying, \"Selena is definitely on a different path right now and in a much better place since Justin is out of the picture. Mentally, she is done with him,\" adding that \"she isn't focused on dating as much as she's just really focusing on herself. She's happy right now just spending time with her girlfriends and going to church.\"\n\nChristopher Polk/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nA second source also noted that Gomez is putting her relationship with her ex-boyfriend \"in the past,\" adding that while she's \"very shocked\" to hear about Bieber's whirlwind engagement, she simply \"doesn't care.\"\n\nYasss, girl!\n\n\"Selena knows that Justin makes rash decisions, but wishes them both the best. She is truly focused on herself and Justin is no longer a topic of conversation in her life,\" the second source told E! News.\n\nSorry, Justin. Looks like our girl is just as over you as you are with her.\n\nOn July 10, just days after Bieber's engagement was confirmed, Gomez was seen in New York City wearing gray sweatpants and a black T-shirt that said, \"only the strong survive,\" and let me tell you, it is a mood and I am feeling it. While some might say that this is her way of telling the world that she's a fierce warrior in the midst of all the engagement hubbub, let's be honest: we already knew that.\n\nAnd, considering that we saw her without a care in the world shortly after the news of the engagement actually broke, methinks that she's doing juuuust fine.\n\nOn Sunday, July 8, Gomez's friend and assistant, Theresa Mingus, posted a photo to Instagram showing herself and Gomez hanging out on a yacht, looking like they were living their best life (because spoiler alert: if you're on a yacht, you are UNDOUBTEDLY doing just that):\n\nSo c'mon, fam. It looks like Bieber's quite smitten with Baldwin, and Gomez is living it up with friends and enjoying being single, so I think it's time we give Jelena a rest and set our sights on Jailey.\n\nMaybe it's not what we anticipated the outcome would be for this love triangle, but let's work with what we've got and be happy that everyone involved is happy \u2014 or seems to be, at the very least.\n\nLet's all give a big congrats to the happy couple, and an even bigger applause to Selena. You do you, boo!"}
{"label": false, "txt": "A new report about how Khloe Kardashian feels \"guilty over her happy pregnancy\" while Kylie Jenner \"struggles\" is completely made-up. The fabricated article comes from a website known for its manufactured Kardashian-Jenner stories, but Gossip Cop can set the record straight. We're told that no one close to either star is feeding the untrustworthy HollywoodLife with information about their pregnancies.\n\nREX/Shutterstock\n\nAs recently reported, on Wednesday Kardashian revealed she and Tristan are expecting their first child together. So, to capitalize on that news, the unreliable outlet has manufactured an absurd article titled, \"Khloe Kardashian Feels Guilty Over Happy Pregnancy As Sis Kylie Struggles With Hers.\" In the story, a so-called \"source\" is quoted as telling the often discredited website, \"Khloe has gone through absolute hell when it comes to her relationships so she feels very deserving of all the happiness with Tristan, but there's one dark spot for her right now and that's the state of Kylie's relationship with Travis [Scott].\"\n\nThe webloid's seemingly fake \"insider\" further purports, \"Khloe is uber protective of Kylie and it really makes her sad to see that Kylie isn't getting the kind of love and commitment from Travis that she's getting from Tristan.\" What's more, the outlet's questionable \"source\" goes on to claim that Kardashian \"has no reason to feel guilty,\" but \"she feels bad that things are going so well for her when her little sister is struggling\" with her \"reported pregnancy.\"\n\nFirstly, if the aptly nicknamed HollywoodLies really had a reputable Kardashian-Jenner \"source,\" it would know Jenner is actually having a baby rather than referring to her \"reported\" pregnancy. Secondly, and as Gossip Cop has noted in the past, no one from either star's trusted inner circle would ever talk to a website that Jenner herself has slammed for posting numerous stories about her that are untrue. For both of those reasons and more, it's hard to believe a single word of the webloid's newest claim.\n\nStill, Gossip Cop fact-checked the outlet's latest tale, and a source close to Kardashian assured us the story is complete \"nonsense.\" The \"Kylie Cosmetics\" mogul is yet to officially confirm she's expecting, but that doesn't mean her older sister is \"worried\" about pregnancy and relationship with Scott. Of course, ever since People first reported that Scott hasn't been around as much as Jenner would like, HollywoodLies has unashamedly made that its new focus, posting multiple stories about their relationship and how her family feels about the rapper. They're all made-up.\n\nMore on Gossip Cop:\n\nBen Affleck isn't trying to win back Jennifer Garner\n\nEmma Watson and Robert Pattinson aren't dating\n\nBrad Pitt isn't trying to support Jennifer Aniston"}

While Swift has yet to make her future plans for new music official, she has been regularly releasing new music since her first album in 2006 and was reportedly inspired to create new songs after her split from Hiddleston.\n\n\u201c[Taylor Swift] is handling things well and she is working on music and writing lyrics down all the time especially since she has been involved in so many recent high profile news stories with [Tom Hiddleston] or [Kanye West] and even the Super Bowl speculation,\u201d a source told Hollywood Life. \u201cShe has a lot of material to work off.\u201d\n\nA new album is \u201cstill a work in progress because when she puts something out she wants to fully support it with a tour and television appearances,\u201d the source continued. \u201cShe is enjoying a little break so there is still some time for all of that.\u201d\n\nSince splitting from Hiddleston last year, Taylor Swift has been keeping a low profile as she focuses on her career and friendships with her popular girl squad, which includes Lily Aldridge and Gigi Hadid.\n\n[Featured Image by Jason Merritt/Getty Images]"}

In a new interview, however, former 1D member Malik admits that while he\u2019s mostly on good terms with his former bandmates (fights and all), he\u2019s not in contact with Harry Styles.

{"label": false, "txt": "One of the more romantic scenes in Lifetime's take on everyone's favorite royal duo, Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance, involves the wedding of someone the couple is only tangentially related to: Pippa Middleton, sister of Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cambridge. In the made-for-TV movie, the almost-royal is excluded from a pretty significant Middleton family gathering (ahem, our girl Pippa's wedding ceremony) and as it turns out, the real Meghan Markle wasn't at Pippa's wedding ceremony, either \u2014 but she managed to make it to the reception.\n\nIn the movie, the fictional Markle is on the phone with her mother, slightly sad about being left out, when Harry bursts in to take her to the party after all \u2014 where she met Harry's parents for the first time. In the film, Kate Middleton blames her sister's \"no ring, no bring\" policy \u2014 meaning only engaged or married couples were allowed \u2014 for Markle being benched. (In real life and in the movie, Markle and the prince were not yet betrothed.)\n\nAs it turns out, this plus one policy was the real deal, but as PEOPLE noted, both James Middleton's longtime girlfriend Donna Air and Princess Eugenie's longtime boyfriend Jack Brooksbank attended the ceremony. Additionally, according to The Telegraph, Markle was fully invited to Middleton's May 2017 wedding despite the \"no ring no bring\" policy, but at the last moment Markle did not appear at the ceremony itself. So what gives?\n\nThe way PEOPLE told the story, Harry left after the ceremony and drove 90 minutes back to London to pick up his then girlfriend from Kensington Palace where she was cooped up. According to Vanity Fair, Markle had been seen in London before the wedding and everything seemed good to go. E! news reported that Markle skipped out of the ceremony so as not to draw attention to a wedding that was not her own and upstage the couple on their special day. (For the record, The Daily Beast was already speculating whether or not Markle would steal the show, as many once thought Pippa did at her sister's wedding, before the big day even arrived.) It's also possible there was concern that the paparazzi, who mobbed Markle at every chance, would make for unruly and unwelcome wedding guests. The Mirror speculates that it was always the plan for Markle to attend the reception, despite laying low for the wedding itself, and that Prince Harry's last-minute drive was simply so she wouldn't have to arrive alone. (Bustle reached out to Kensington Palace for comment but did not hear back.)\n\ncourtesy of Lifetime\n\nUnfortunately for that wasn't the end of the drama. There was still some slight scandal when The Mirror reported that Markle's black dress and white cape was a sombre fashion faux pas for a wedding reception. The Lifetime movie leaves this bit out, making Markle's reception dress red, and any real life faux pas doesn't seem to have affected any permanent damage on Markle's relationship with the Royals in 2018.\n\nOh, but there's more: The wedding reception scene in the Lifetime movie takes additional steps to mix fiction with reality for the sake of drama by including a fictional relative named Lady Violet, who wears an offensive brooch to the wedding. The scene calls to mind a heated racist brooch trolling debacle \u2014 in which Princess Michael of Kent caught fire for wearing a blackamoor brooch, with an exotic and offensive depiction of an African person, to a luncheon attended by Markle. The Princess later apologized and claimed not to have worn something so offensive to Markle intentionally, but in the Lifetime movie, Harry warns this fictional Lady Violet about the same brooch, months before the luncheon would have taken place \u2014 which is a pretty shady twist on the real life story.\n\nAnd look, there was probably a decent amount of actual family drama at Pippa's wedding \u2014 the Royals are humans, after all, and humans get dramatic at weddings. But clearly, the Lifetime movie plays up it all up for our amusement \u2014 likely far more than anything that actually happened in real life."}

{"label": false, "txt": "In a video viewed more than 6m times on Twitter, 21-year-old Chika Oranika summed up the current feelings of many black Americans about Kanye West. She delivered her own lyrics over the beat of the rap star\u2019s Jesus Walks. \u201cHow you say you Yeezus but do nothing to restore us? You support the people up in power that abort us,\u201d she raps into the camera. \u201cIt don\u2019t matter how much money you got or you lack, when that cheque clear don\u2019t forget that your children are still black.\u201d\n\nWhy the opprobrium, which has come from activists, Hollywood stars and fellow musicians, as well as withering online freestyles? West, one of the most significant, complex and celebrated rappers in the US, has used a 350-tweet stream of consciousness over the past fornight to throw his support firmly behind Donald Trump. But yesterday, he went way beyond party politics in an interview with TMZ, saying, in a sloppy bit of rhetoric: \u201cYou hear about slavery for 400 years. For 400 years? That sounds like a choice.\u201d\n\nHost Van Lathan tore back at him: \u201cWhile you are making music and being an artist and living the life that you\u2019ve earned by being a genius, the rest of us in society have to deal with these threats to our lives.\u201d Roxane Gay reacted on Twitter by calling his comments \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201ctrite, shallow \u2026 he is not a free thinker. He is a free moron.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 2:34 From Taylor Swift to Hurricane Katrina: five of Kanye West's memorable outbursts \u2013 video\n\nBlack America\u2019s dismay at West has been brewing for some time. He puzzled many when he posed for photos with Trump in December 2016, making him one of the first celebrities to apparently endorse the new president. But his recent tweets left no room for doubt. He posted a picture of himself wearing the Trump campaign\u2019s Make America Great Again cap, and tweeted: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to agree with Trump but the mob can\u2019t make me not love him. We are both dragon energy. He is my brother.\u201d After an intervention by a presumably somewhat weary Kim Kardashian, West wrote: \u201cMy wife just called me and she wanted me to make this clear to everyone. I don\u2019t agree with everything Trump does. I don\u2019t agree 100% with anyone but myself.\u201d\n\nIn response, R&B singer Frank Ocean emerged from hibernation with a sarcastic screengrab of the time West went off-script during a 2005 Hurricane Katrina appeal to say \u201cGeorge Bush doesn\u2019t care about black people\u201d, the intimation being that it is now West who doesn\u2019t care. Samuel L Jackson suggested West was courting an audience in \u201cthe sunken place\u201d \u2013 the psychic interzone in the horror film Get Out into which black people are hypnotised and silenced (the film\u2019s director, Jordan Peele, has previously linked it to Trump\u2019s America).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dragon brothers? West with Donald Trump, 2016. Photograph: REX/Shutterstock\n\n\u201cSo many people who love you feel so betrayed right know because they know the harm that Trump\u2019s policies cause, especially to people of colour,\u201d West\u2019s friend John Legend wrote in a text message that West posted on Twitter. The rap star wrote back: \u201cYou bringing up my fans or my legacy is a tactic based on fear used to manipulate my free thought.\u201d Among ordinary Americans, meanwhile, there was seething anger at West supporting someone who has reportedly said \u201claziness is a trait in blacks\u201d; who campaigned for the death penalty for the black teenagers, later proven innocent, in the Central Park Five case; and who thought there were some \u201cvery fine people\u201d marching alongside neo-Nazis and white supremacists in Charlottesville.\n\nReacting to \u2013 or having perhaps anticipated \u2013 all this, West released a new track, Ye Vs the People, the first music from two new albums being released in June. In a dialogue with the American people (vocalised by rapper T.I.), Kanye tries to detoxify the Trump brand and reclaim his Make America Great Again slogan: \u201cWearin\u2019 the hat\u2019ll show people that we equal,\u201d he raps, arguing for a why-can\u2019t-we-all-just-get-along humanism. He ultimately distils the debate thus: \u201cYou on some choosin\u2019 side shit, I\u2019m on some unified shit.\u201d\n\nSo many people who love you feel so betrayed right know \u2013 John Legend\n\nFor Kanye, this chapter is just the latest incident in an uncompromising career. At the turn of the century, as a beatmaker for Jay-Z and others, he really did seem to be on \u201csome unified shit\u201d, taking the chopped-up soul samples of \u201cbackpack\u201d hip-hop and pairing them with the blockbuster tropes of mainstream rap production; he then successfully segued into being a unified producer-rapper. His first two albums charmed the whole spectrum of rap fans with their diversity and humour: he riffed on black cultural reference points \u2013 slow-jam love songs, social climbers \u2013 like a standup comedian.\n\nHis albums became more ambitious with each new release, unifying diverse cultural reference points \u2013 Graduation sampled Daft Punk and explored a more electronic sound; 808s & Heartbreak used Auto-Tune to reflect and enact emotional dissonance, to brilliant effect; My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was as operatic as the title suggests. His interest in visual art grew, with artists from Takashi Murakami to George Condo commissioned for his album covers; he designed his own fashion collections and collaborated with Adidas. In 2013, he said: \u201cCreative genius, that\u2019s my title. My title is not rapper any more.\u201d West positioned himself as a rounded aesthete, obsessed with form and how art impacts society \u2013 his Twitter feed has recently featured everything from tech solutions for water desalination to artists Joseph Beuys and David Hammons. Part of his attraction to Kardashian seemed to be her very iconography: \u201cMy girl a superstar all from a home movie\u201d, he wondered admiringly on 2012 track Clique.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest With his wife Kim Kardashian in the video for Famous. Photograph: Tidal\n\nHe also continued his analysis of black America. On the same track he raps: \u201cYou know white people get money, don\u2019t spend it / Or maybe they get money, buy a business / I\u2019d rather buy 80 gold chains and go ig\u2019nant.\u201d West sees himself as celebrating the economic freedom black Americans were denied for decades, and to which they still have much less access than whites. It\u2019s an extension of a key Jay-Z line \u2013 \u201cI do this for my culture, to let \u2019em know what a nigga look like, when a nigga in a roadster\u201d \u2013 from Izzo (HOVA), a track that Kanye produced.\n\nOn New Slaves, meanwhile, from 2013 album Yeezus, West expressed a more nuanced version of his slavery comments this week: that black Americans were subject to a new kind of slavery, the rabid consumerism for Maybach cars and Alexander Wang clothes that traps them in economic bondage. Julius Bailey, a philosophy professor at Ohio\u2019s Wittenberg University, who has edited a book of essays called The Cultural Impact of Kanye West, argues that West should be criticised for his TMZ interview, but \u201con the basis that he didn\u2019t speak to the material implications of post-chattel slavery,\u201d as he has done on New Slaves and Clique. \u201cKanye\u2019s heartfelt apology [to Van Lathan on TMZ after his comments] was a way of realising that his words, when not qualified or contextualised, do more damage than the emancipating good he seeks.\u201d Some of West\u2019s other lyrics have been similarly clumsy, even offensive. He sampled Billie Holiday\u2019s Strange Fruit, a song about lynching, for Blood on the Leaves, a song about the destructive power of fame in which he also compared a man having his wife and mistress separated at a basketball game to apartheid.\n\nAnd since Yeezus, his self-obsession has become stifling. His 2016 album The Life of Pablo has a great skit called I Love Kanye, where he imagines: \u201cWhat if Kanye made a song about Kanye called I Miss the Old Kanye? Man, that\u2019d be so Kanye!\u201d\n\nIn the wake of his slavery comments, the skit stops being funny: black people really do miss the old, outward-looking Kanye. Rapper Meek Mill summed up the thoughts of many when he posted an image of Kanye to Instagram yesterday, surrounded by the words \u201cRIP Old Kanye\u201d and quoting Kanye\u2019s lyrics back at him: \u201cI feel the pressure, under more scrutiny / And what I do? Act more stupidly.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kanye West xAdidas show, autumn/winter New York, 2015. Photograph: Leandro Justen/BFANYC.com/REX/Shutterstock\n\nThe problem is that Kanye\u2019s self-scrutiny has become so advanced that he is beginning to see the world purely through the prism of Kanye, rather than the eyes of black America. That\u2019s harmful not just to himself, but to an ongoing civil rights struggle in a still-racist US; his provocations have the potential to embolden the alt-right and others who would diminish the standing of African Americans.\n\nLike Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, both figures he admires, it\u2019s hard to place Kanye on to a left-right political binary. His personal political philosophy doesn\u2019t neatly dovetail with existing belief systems \u2013 witness how the alt-right embraced him after his championing of Trump, and then deserted him when he also championed Parkland shooting survivor and activist Emma Gonzalez last weekend.\n\nHis embrace of Trump \u2013 as with his embrace of black conservative commentator Candace Owens, whom he met with after tweeting \u201cI love the way [she] thinks\u201d \u2013 is, to him, apolitical. \u201cI see it as simply being contrarian and a bit arrogant, not an actual cosigning of the ideas espoused by Trump relative to immigration, urban policy or militarism,\u201d Bailey says. \u201cHe\u2019s being a fan of wealth.\u201d Kanye champions Trump\u2019s \u201cenergy\u201d and sees in him the same self-creation that he wants for himself, and, perhaps, for black America \u2013 but like other successful, moneyed libertarians, he has become cut off from reality, and assumes that all you need to make it is willpower, perhaps helped along by his inspirational bromides on Twitter (today\u2019s being \u201cMost fear is learned\u201d). Insulated by his money and cultural clout, West is immune from the draining power of Trump\u2019s energy and the legacies of slavery, and is free to celebrate or question them. The racism he has experienced \u2013 being ostracised by pop radio and high fashion \u2013 is real and clearly painful, as he returns to the subject in another interview this week with radio host Charlamagne tha God. Yet having eventually been given access to fashion at least, West seems to believe that all black people can have that kind of agency \u2013 that self-belief alone can set you free. It\u2019s the kind of illusion that makes Trumpism so seductive.\n\nAny analysis is complicated by West\u2019s hospitalisation for two weeks in 2016 after a mental breakdown, following intense touring and an incident where Kardashian was robbed in Paris. He has recast the episode as a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d and says he is using medication that \u201chelps calm me down\u201d; Kardashian has expressed frustration at how Kanye is framed as mentally ill when he is \u201cjust being himself when he has always been expressive\u201d. And of course, there is a long history of black people being dismissed as crazy.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kanye West performing on The Pyramid Stage at Glastonbury, 2015. Photograph: Yui Mok/PA\n\nA more generous reading is that Kanye still cares a lot about black America, and in some ways he is a victim of an increasingly dogmatic, polarised culture \u2013 one created, in part, by his and Trump\u2019s mouthpiece of choice, Twitter. \u201cSlavery in America was from 1618 to 1865?\u201d asks Bailey. \u201cIf so, 400 years takes us to 2018, which [chimes with] exactly what all those black nationalists, anti-colonialists, some academicians, and even George Clinton called for, namely an emancipation of the mind.\u201d Kanye is frustrated by the social homogeneity he perceives: \u201cSee that\u2019s the problem with this damn nation / All blacks gotta be Democrats, man, we ain\u2019t made it off the plantation,\u201d he raps in Ye Vs the People, suggesting that supporting Republicans is an expression of black freedom. \u201cI vehemently hate the \u2018sunken place\u2019 reference, for Kanye has proven his bona fides in black emancipation and black love,\u201d says Bailey. \u201cWe know, via his own words on his albums and interviews, that he stands against racism in all its forms. Kanye may be arrogant, mentally unstable, narcissistic and insensitive but, for him, he is free.\u201d\n\n\u2022 This article was amended on 3 May 2018 to add the word \u201creportedly\u201d in relation to a quote attributed to Donald Trump: while a former employee said in a 1991 book that Trump had told him \u201claziness is a trait in blacks\u201d, Trump has denied saying that or anything like it."}

Then he said it again. I said something like, \u2018Relax Al, this isn\u2019t SNL\u2026we don\u2019t need to rehearse the kiss.\u2019 He continued to insist, and I was beginning to get uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nTweeden continued: \u201cHe repeated that actors really need to rehearse everything and that we must practice the kiss. I said \u2018OK\u2019 so he would stop badgering me. We did the line leading up to the kiss and then he came at me, put his hand on the back of my head, mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth. I immediately pushed him away with both of my hands against his chest and told him if he ever did that to me again I wouldn\u2019t be so nice about it the next time.\u201d\n\nThe sportscaster said she felt \u201cdisgusted and violated\u201d and when she performed the skit with Franken on stage, she turned her head so he couldn\u2019t kiss her on the lips again.\n\nTweeden wrote that on the way home from the tour later that year, she found a photo of Franken putting his hands on her breasts while she was sleeping.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Tweeden wrote. \u201cHe groped me, without my consent, while I was asleep. I felt violated all over again. Embarrassed. Belittled. Humiliated. How dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think it\u2019s funny?\u201d\n\nFranken released a statement shortly after the accusations broke.\n\n\u201cThe first thing I want to do is apologize: to Leeann, to everyone else who was part of that tour, to everyone who has worked for me, to everyone I represent, and to everyone who counts on me to be an ally and supporter and champion of women,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThere\u2019s more I want to say, but the first and most important thing \u2014 and if it\u2019s the only thing you care to hear, that\u2019s fine \u2014 is: I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI respect women,\u201d he continues. \u201cI don\u2019t respect men who don\u2019t.

We should meet again.'\"\n\nAt the photo call in the Kensington Palace gardens following their engagement announcement, Harry was asked when he knew Markle was the one. He quickly replied, \"the very first time we met.\"\n\nThings moved quickly from there. The couple went on a second date and Prince Harry then invited Markle to accompany him on a trip to Africa just three or four weeks later. \"I managed to persuade her to come and join me in Botswana and we camped out with each other under the stars,\" he said, describing the whirlwind romance. \"Then we were really by ourselves, which was crucial to me to make sure that we had a chance to get to know each other.\"\n\n\n\nThe News Gets Out\n\nAfter four months of quiet dating, the news finally leaked on October 31, 2016 that Prince Harry was dating an American actress.

{"label": false, "txt": "Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt relationship problems have reportedly existed for months, with signs ranging from her rapid weight loss to a fragile 79 pounds to increasing rumors of his flirtations with co-stars on his movie sets. And now, amid a new report that Jolie and Pitt were arguing over whose career should take priority, comes the news that Brad has exited from Top Gear, according to Design & Trend\u2018s sources.\n\nPitt had initially been viewed as the ideal person for show\u2019s return. But when Brad abruptly changed his mind, Top Gear was left in shambles. As to why the famous actor would leave a show in the lurch?\n\nBrad, 52, and Angelina, 40, are battling over who should care for their children, with a source explaining that the two had agreed to take turns minding the kids and pursuing career ambitions.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re at war over who\u2019s looking after the kids since that agreement got blown out the window with her desire to turn her directing career into a success after several failures. This is tearing them apart, but Brad\u2019s got no choice.\u201d\n\nPitt is pointing to his efforts to help Angelina in her ambitions to become a director, but he feels that he has gone above and beyond by participating in her \u201cflop,\u201d By the Sea. In addition, Design & Trend cites a friend of Jolie\u2019s who describes the problems she\u2019s had in her life and how they affect her now.\n\n\u201cAngie has some serious dark demons that have never entirely let go and it is still affecting her life and marriage,\u201d revealed one friend. \u201cHer wild lifestyle when she was younger and her intense surgeries to avoid getting breast and ovarian cancer have taken a toll on her as a person and a life partner.\u201d\n\nWith her past issues catching up with her, Angelina tends to isolate herself from both her husband and her children, claims that pal. And although Brad first liked the \u201cdark side\u201d of Jolie, he increasingly feels that she\u2019s pushing him away.\n\n\u201cIt can be really hard on him. He feels he has been more than patient with Angie, but his confidence in their happiness is wearing thin,\u201d added the friend.\n\nAdding to the problems in their marriage, Angelina is jealous that Pitt spends so much time with actress Marion Cotillard, according to an insider cited by Hollywood Life, which describes Jolie as \u201cwasting away\u201d over her husband\u2019s affair, weighing only 79 pounds.\n\nAlthough Marion is his co-star and their time together is on the movie set, Angelina is still furious, pushing Brad to consider divorce. Although no romantic affairs have taken place, Pitt has been gushing about Marion, explained the insider.\n\n\u201cThe resentment has been eating away at Angelina. She\u2019s prone to think that since she was once Brad\u2019s co-star and seduced him away from his wife, the same will happen to her.\u201d\n\nThat reference to how Jolie \u201cseduced\u201d Pitt away from his spouse refers to Jennifer Aniston. But the problem here is that rather than having Marion seduce Brad away from Angelina, it\u2019s Jolie\u2019s own jealousy and refusal to listen to him that is pushing Pitt to file for divorce, claims the insider.\n\n\u201cHe will be the one to file. He\u2019s fed up with her controlling ways, her obstinateness when it comes to listening to him about her health issues and how she needs to slow down and now her outright jealousy when it comes to other women,\u201d added the source.\n\nAs to parallels to Pitt\u2019s marriage and divorce from Jennifer Aniston, that drama began in 2004 when Brad started working on the 2005 movie Mr. and Mrs. Smith and became intimately acquainted with the woman who would become his girlfriend and then his wife, Angelina, as the Inquisitr reported.\n\nPitt and Jolie reportedly began their relationship during that film, with Brad subsequently confessing that he \u201cfell in love\u201d with Angelina on the movie set. He divorced Aniston by fall 2005, and Jolie announced her pregnancy with his child in January 2006.\n\nWill Angelina suffer the same fate as Jennifer?

(Khlo\u00e9, 33, and Thompson, 27, welcomed their first child together, daughter True, on April 12 \u2014 just two days after allegations surfaced that he cheated on her throughout her pregnancy.)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to give too much away, because we genuinely had those conversations and sometimes we were filming and sometimes we weren\u2019t,\u201d said Kim, 37. \u201cIt was more maybe when Khlo\u00e9 wanted her privacy and no cameras when she was in Cleveland going through that, [but] the sisters were still all filming and talking [about] how to approach it and what to do.\u201d\n\nKim admitted the situation was a first for the famous family.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely new territory for us when you have a new baby coming into the world,\u201d she said. \u201cI think ultimately, we always want her to be happy, but it gets all clouded when there\u2019s a baby, you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cHer motherly instincts kicked in and she has to do what makes her happy,\u201d she added of Khlo\u00e9 standing by Thompson. \u201cSo we\u2019ll support that.\u201d\n\nReflecting on Khlo\u00e9 going into labor in Cleveland while the rest of the family was in Los Angeles, Kim said her sister wanted to keep the news under wraps.\n\n\u201c[Khlo\u00e9] didn\u2019t want anyone to know she was in labor so my mom just left and got on a plane,\u201d said Kim. \u201cThen me and my other sisters get on another plane and we were like, \u2018This is so stupid, we all need to be together and go through this!\u2019 And it was so much drama getting there.

{"label": false, "txt": "Meghan Markle has had to give up a lot since marrying Prince Harry \u2014 and now she'll have to add baby showers to the list. The new Duchess of Sussex has managed to shake things up since joining the royal family, but she would be breaking royal protocol if she were to throw a bash before any future baby is born. This rule might be a bummer for Meghan, but it actually makes a lot of sense.\n\n\"[The royals] are clearly very wealthy, and a lavish baby shower would be seen as highly inappropriate,\" ABC News' royal expert Vickie Arbiter said back in 2013 when Kate Middleton was pregnant with Prince George. \"There's nothing they can't go out and buy themselves.\"\n\nWhether or not Meghan could accept baby-related gifts is murky. According to British rules, \"Gifts offered by private individuals living in the United Kingdom not personally known to the Member of the Royal Family should be refused where there are concerns about the propriety or motives of the donor or the gift itself.\" (This is why she and Prince Harry had to return more than $9 milion worth of wedding presents.) Gifts from strangers have to be turned down, but what about offerings from her friends? The answer seems unclear, but it's possible the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would return everything, including gifts from friends, just so they can't be accused of being improper.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle also have the option of just asking for donations in lieu of gifts, so they don't have to deal with the issue of acceptability. They did this at their wedding, although they received gifts anyway \u2014 including their new titles.\n\nBaby showers aren't quite as popular in the United Kingdom as they are here in America, so throwing a baby shower might also be odd in addition to inappropriate. Because Meghan is known for her rule-breaking streak, we guess that she'll at least have her dear friends visit to celebrate. Even a heartfelt congratulations over the phone would suffice.\n\nOf course, we won't have to worry about any of this until Meghan announces that she's expecting (if she ever does!).\n\nMore From Woman's World\n\nMeghan Markle's New British Accent Confuses Fans \u2014 But She's Not the Only Celeb to Change Her Voice\n\nWhy You'll Never See Meghan Markle Wearing Wedges Around the Queen\n\n4 Heartwarming Ways Meghan Markle Has Paid Tribute to Princess Diana"}

While we all know who Prince Harry's ex-girlfriends are (looking at you, Chelsy Davy and Cressida Bonas) \u2013 Meghan's love life history is still as mysterious as the Crown Jewels. Just last week the mother of all bombshells dropped when it was reported Meghan went on a date with porn star Simon Rex in 2004 when she was an aspiring actress.

A besotted Meghan even featured Cory on her now defunct lifestyle blog The Tig, but the post has since been removed. The [UK Telegraph] claims the Suits star was an item with the successful celebrity chef for two years and they were together when Meghan hit it off with Harry in July, 2016. At the time, a friend close of the exes addressed speculation Harry could have played a part in their demise, saying: \"I can't comment on that.\" Just before they broke up, Cory praised his significant other for working with World Vision. \"So proud of my lady @meghanmarkle being named Global Ambassador for @worldvision #worldwaterday,\" he penned.\n\nCory and Meghan lived together in Toronto and were said to be together when Meghan first met Harry.\n\nBut was it always just going to be a flash in the pan? \"They were a very handsome pair and well suited, but you got the impression it was a sometimes superficial relationship,\" an insider revealed to The Daily Mail. \"Cory was always very focused on his job and his work.

The gun cook is a regular guest star on lifestyle shows and runs a string of successful restaurants in Toronto. \"There's no downside to being a well-known chef. There are thousands of great cooks in the city, and there are chefs who are more deserving of the celebrity than myself,\" he told Toronto Life in 2016 of his high profile.

And Meghan's failed marriage to American producer Trevor Engelson, 41, makes us love her even more \u2013 because in this day and age, who seriously hasn't had a doomed relationship. After dating for six years, Meghan and Trevor, who owns his own production company called Underground, became engaged in 2010. In September, 2011, they tied the knot in an extravagant beach-side wedding at the Jamaica Inn in Ocho Rios, Jamaica. There were over 100 guests in attendance and the celebrations kicked on for days (hopefully she'll do something just as fun with Harry.) Their marriage lasted just two years and by September, 2013 they had quietly separated. Sources close to the couple claim Meghan's role on Suits, which is filmed in Toronto, played a part in their demise. \"It put a strain on the relationship. Trevor was in LA making movies, Meghan was in another country five hours' flight away and it simply took its toll,\" a friend told The Daily Mail. Most recently, Trevor was apparently set to cash in on his marriage to a could-be-potential princess with the explosive news he's working on a TV show with a very familiar plot line. According to Deadline, the show, which is not yet titled, will be based on an American divorced mother who moves to London to marry a British Prince. It will reportedly explore the difficulties of sharing custody with the royal family when your ex-wife is married to a Prince. Although the exes don't share any kids, the controversial concept was dreamt up after Trevor was chatting to his fellow producer Dan Farah, speculating what it would have been like if they did have to share custody of children.\n\n\"Me and my lady in London,\" Trevor penned back in 2010 next to this snap.

{"label": false, "txt": "Date of Birth: February 11, 1969\n\nFebruary 11, 1969 Rumored Procedures: Rhinoplasty, lip injections, breast augmentation\n\nJennifer Aniston first made a name for herself in the 1990s starring as the lovable character Rachel on Friends. She quickly became a household name, even donning a signature haircut otherwise known as \"The Rachel.\" Since her rocket to stardom, Aniston has also made headlines for her love life, marrying and subsequently divorcing Hollywood's leading man, Brad Pitt. Following her divorce, rumors have swirled that Aniston has surgically altered her appearance, including a modest breast enhancement and not-so-modest lip injections. While the actress publicly discusses her tough workout regimens, and declares that she is all-natural, one can't help but wonder: has America's sweetheart undergone cosmetic surgery?\n\nBreast Augmentation\n\nWhile many have speculated that Aniston has undergone breast enhancement, the actress adamantly denies the rumors, even chalking her fuller breasts up to weight gain and a few too many \"cheese boards.\" The rumors were fueled by celebrity magazines that published photos of Aniston's breasts appearing fuller than ever during an appearance on the 2007 People's Choice Awards.\n\nRhinoplasty\n\nA quick look at a \"then and now\" profile of Aniston leads many people to believe that she has undergone not one, but two rhinoplasty surgeries. In photos taken in the early 90s, Aniston's bridge and nostrils appear much wider than they do today. Aniston admitted to having a deviated septum corrected, but said she was unhappy with the results. In February 2007, Aniston made a second attempt to correct the problem, and was quoted as saying, \"best thing I ever did. I slept like a baby for the first time in years.\"\n\nLip Injections\n\nIn 2008, Aniston was photographed with her lips looking a bit plumper than usual. Many magazines speculated that she received lip injection treatments after she emerged with a significantly larger upper lip. Some celebrity plastic surgeons even weighed in, noting a considerable difference. Luckily, Aniston's enhancement fit well with the rest of her features.\n\nChoosing a Cosmetic Surgeon\n\nCelebrities are no strangers to cosmetic surgery. In an environment where youth is highly prized, it would not be unexpected for Aniston, 40, to opt for cosmetic procedures to maintain her look. In fact the actress has stated that she will never rule out the possibility of receiving cosmetic treatments and supports actions that women take to feel better about their appearance. If Aniston has previously received cosmetic surgery, she has avoided criticism about her looks by choosing skilled plastic surgeons. One of the reasons it is so hard to tell if she underwent surgery is because her results are very natural-looking. This has helped keep her name off of any \"worst\" cosmetic surgery lists. No matter what your desired outcome, it is important to find a skilled professional to perform any kind of cosmetic surgery. Doing so will not only maintain the safety of your health, but it will also produce the natural-looking results that you desire.\n\nContact a Plastic Surgeon\n\nProcedures such as rhinoplasty, breast augmentation, and lip injections can enhance your overall appearance. If you are interested in learning more about plastic surgery, contact a plastic surgeon in your area to find out if you are a good candidate for treatment.\n\nImage sources: Jennifer Aniston before and after surgery."}

It seems that Aniston is pining for Theroux now that Brad Pitt is with Neri Oxman, and she would like to give her marriage another shot, even if it is just for a trial period.\n\n\u201cJen\u2019s done a lot of meditating and says she forgives Justin for messing her around so badly. She\u2019s keen to move on and forge a good relationship with him, instead of arguing over money or slinging mud back and forth among their mutual friends,\u201d claims an insider.\n\nThe source added that if Theroux gave Aniston another chance, she would take him back \u201cin a heartbeat.\u201d\n\nWhen the couple called it quits back in February, they had been living separate lives for months, and they couldn\u2019t come to an agreement over where to live or if they should start a family. Also, during their two years of marriage, Theroux allegedly had a wandering eye and got too close to actress Naomi Watts, which upset Aniston.\n\nBut, if the Friends star is thinking about rekindling their romance, it seems that Theroux isn\u2019t necessarily on the same page. Last week, their mutual friend, Jimmy Kimmel, threw a birthday party for his 1-year-old son Billy, and Theroux purposely left early to avoid his ex.\n\nInsiders say that he only stayed at the birthday bash for about 40 minutes because he found out Aniston had just arrived. The 46-year-old was \u201cnervous and skittish\u201d while she was at the event, and since they are trying to move on and not communicating, it would have been uncomfortable for them both to be there at the same time.\n\nAfter someone alerted Theroux about Aniston\u2019s arrival, he quickly posed for a picture with the birthday boy and then made a quick, sneaky exit.\n\nHBDJ\u2764 XO A post shared by @ justintheroux on Feb 11, 2017 at 6:05pm PST\n\nMeanwhile, cameras have caught Theroux spending time with 26-year-old model Erika Cardenas, and insiders say the two have been \u201cflirting up a storm\u201d after they met at the gym.

It was early days and we hadn\u2019t told anyone. At the same time I was being courted by some really powerful people, the most powerful people in Hollywood.\u201d\n\nDescribing a top-secret party attended by record industry executives, Bieber said he was shown into a back room where a group of men wearing masks were sitting around the edge of the room, drinking from cups. In the center of the room a dead child was sitting cross-legged, propped up against the back of a chair. It looked like a late-stage fetus and was completely drained of blood.\n\n\u201cThe baby\u2019s entire scalp wasn\u2019t there. Its skull had been stripped down to the surface of the bone. Portions of the right side of its undeveloped little face had been torn away.

It was obvious that it was really important for them that I got involved.\n\n\u201cI literally gagged at this point. One of them boasted the baby had been alive for eight hours after they started cutting it and draining its blood.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen he described the pain the baby went through, he seemed pleased with himself.\u201d\n\nThe horrific death described by Bieber to his congregation is called \u201cexsanguination\u201d, otherwise known as completely draining a person of blood. The practice is popular among drinkers of baby blood who consume what they call \u201cred wine\u201d in order to get high on the adrenaline, young hormones, and negative energy they believe is found in the blood of children.\n\nThey believe the more a child suffers before its death, the more \u201cenriched\u201d its blood will be upon harvest. Often the child is physically and sexually abused before it is killed in order to create the necessary trauma.\n\nBieber refused to drink the blood and that is when \u201ceverything started going wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey threatened me. They said they knew Selena was pregnant. They asked if I wanted my baby to end up like the one in the center of the room.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis completely flipped me out and I lost my way for a long time. I went off the rails,\u201d said Bieber, fighting back tears. \u201cThey murdered my unborn child. Me and Selena\u2026 we were driven apart by these people and the trauma.\u201d\n\nBut years have passed since the traumatic episode and Bieber has vowed to protect her and become a family man. Acknowledging rumors that the pair are back together, Bieber even hinted he is set to become a family man.\n\n\u201cThey won\u2019t lay a hand on my family so help me God,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere are truly evil forces at work in the world. God is real. Satan is real,\u201d Bieber said, before exiting the stand.\n\nThese latest allegations from Justin Bieber add to the wave of accusations made by celebrities and musicians about the real nature of the music and entertainment industry elite. Corey Feldman and Elijah Wood have both gone on record exposing the pedophilia at the heart of Hollywood.\n\nAccording to Elijah Wood, innocent young lives are destroyed to satisfy \u201cpeople with parasitic interests\u201d who \u201csee you as their prey.\u201d In an interview with the Sunday Times, Wood dropped a series of bombshells about the pedophiles that run the industry, noting that \u201cClearly something major was going on in Hollywood. It was all organized.\u201d\n\nIf you read the Washington Post or watch CNN, pedophilia is not a problem, and those who talk about it are tinfoil hat wearing kooks perpetuating \u2018fake news.\u2019 But more and more stars are coming forward with similar stories about the depraved Hollywood system.\n\nIn recent months Nicole Kidman, Mel Gibson and Lindsay Lohan have spoken out about pedophilia in Hollywood. Close friends of Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington claim the recently deceased pair were working on exposing the pedophile ring working at the heart of the music industry \u2013 and it cost them their lives.\n\nJustin Bieber shocked his fans by cancelling his world tour and announcing that he needed some time away from the music industry. As more information comes to light, it appears he made the best possible decision."}

{"label": false, "txt": "Update: Sgt. Johnson's mother, Cowanda Jones-Johnson, has now spoken with The Washington Post, and she says Wilson's account is accurate. \"President Trump did disrespect my son and my daughter and also me and my husband,\" Jones-Johnson said. She said she was in the car at the time but declined to elaborate on the specifics of Wilson's claim.\n\nA Democratic congresswoman says she was in the car with the widow of a soldier killed in Niger when President Trump made comments that upset the widow. Rep. Frederica S. Wilson (Fla.) says Trump told Myeshia Johnson that her husband, Sgt. La David T. Johnson, \u201cknew what he signed up for.\u201d Appearing on MSNBC's \u201cMorning Joe\u201d on Wednesday, Wilson added that the widow was in tears after the call and lamented that Trump \u201cdidn't even remember his name.\u201d\n\nAnd Trump has now hit back at the congresswoman, saying he has \u201cproof\u201d that her account is wrong.\n\nDemocrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof). Sad! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 18, 2017\n\nHere's what we can say:\n\nAfter-the-fact accounts can be flawed, and people can hear things in the worst possible way when they come from the mouths of their political opponents. Wilson may be totally honest in what she says, but if she believes Trump is a bad person, her recollection will not be charitable. If Trump has proof that Wilson is wrong, he needs to produce it immediately. The idea that Trump said this is \u2014 unfortunately \u2014 completely believable, given his track record of handling sensitive situations has ranged from awkward to offensive.\n\nThis is hardly the first time we've seen Trump wrapped up in a dispute involving a Gold Star family. In fact, it's the second day in a row in which Trump's comments about the relatives of dead service members have been at issue. On Monday, he suggested that his chief of staff, retired Marine general John Kelly, had not received a phone call from President Barack Obama after his son's death. White House officials have only elaborated on the matter anonymously.\n\nGoing back to the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump showed very little compunction about attacking the Khans, a Gold Star family that criticized him, and publicly questioned the war hero status of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who was a prisoner of war for seven years in Vietnam. While most politicians treat these matters very, very delicately \u2014 or steer clear of them altogether \u2014 Trump has repeatedly declined to do so. He has often proactively politicized them.\n\nAnd whatever you think about Trump, displaying empathy is not his strong suit. The way he talks about tragedy is routinely awkward, at best, and tasteless, at worst. Puerto Rico is dealing with the fallout of a devastating hurricane, and Trump talks about how it will pay for the relief effort, suggests the island is at fault for its poor situation, and attacks San Juan's mayor. He turned a death during a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville from a tragedy into a political football when he blamed \u201cboth sides.\u201d While in Florida for the Hurricane Irma relief effort, he seemed to be more reserved, but then he asked a man to attack Obama on camera. When Navy sailors were missing after a tanker collided with a destroyer near Singapore, Trump responded, \u201cThat\u2019s too bad, too bad.\u201d There are plenty more examples.\n\nThere is a tendency to think that some of this is just Trump being provocative and trying to rile up the media by pushing the boundaries of acceptable and presidential behavior. The simpler \u2014 and not mutually exclusive \u2014 alternative is that he just doesn't know how a president should act in these instances.\n\nIn this case, we have alleged Trump comments that were never meant for public consumption. If accurately relayed, they were just Trump being careless, not provocative. But they completely track with everything he has done and said publicly about tragedy before. It's not even difficult to imagine Trump saying these things at a lectern in the Rose Garden.\n\nSo again, it's worth waiting to see what \u201cproof\u201d Trump produces. But the benefit of the doubt went out the window a long time ago, and Trump has himself to blame."}

{"label": false, "txt": "In the absence of one Donald Trump , who hosted a rally for himself in Michigan in lieu of attending the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner Saturday night, the MC and comedian Michelle Wolf declined to, as they say, take any prisoners. \u201cLike a porn star says when she\u2019s about to have sex with Trump, let\u2019s get this over with,\u201d Wolf said, opening her remarks. It was the president\u2019s second consecutive year skipping the Correspondents\u2019 Dinner, attendance at which would require him to be able to take a joke at his own expense. (The last president to miss the dinner, as CNN\u2019s Brian Stelter pointed out on Twitter, was Ronald Reagan, in 1981\u2014then recovering from an attempted assassination.)\n\nAmong the objects of her scathing one-liners were several White House officials who did attend the Correspondents\u2019 Dinner\u2014for, it seems, they weren\u2019t professionally mandated to fill out the crowd at the Michigan rally\u2014as well as reporters and broadcast journalists across the political spectrum. Mike Pence, Al Franken, Megyn Kelly, Rachel Maddow, Kellyanne Conway, and Morning Joe \u2019s Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski all got a bit of a roast\u2014but perhaps no segment of the speech was quite so noted among audiences as Wolf\u2019s jokes about Trump\u2019s wealth (\u201cMr. President, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re very rich; you might be rich in Idaho, but in New York, you\u2019re doing fine\u201d) and about Sarah Huckabee Sanders, just in general.\n\nSanders was reportedly seated in Wolf\u2019s direct line of sight, making the comments all the bolder: \u201cI loved you as Aunt Lydia in The Handmaid\u2019s Tale ,\u201d Wolf said to her. \u201cI\u2019m never really sure what to call Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Is it Sarah Sanders, Sarah Huckabee Sanders? Is it Cousin Huckabee? Is it Auntie Huckabee Sanders? Like, what\u2019s Uncle Tom, but for white women who disappoint other white women? Oh, I know, Aunt Coulter.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times journalist Maggie Haberman complimented Sanders\u2019s seeming gameness for taking the criticism\u2014\u201cThat @PressSec sat and absorbed intense criticism of her physical appearance, her job performance, and so forth, instead of walking out, on national television, was impressive,\u201d she wrote on Twitter\u2014a perspective that, judging by social media reactions both to her tweet and to the Correspondents\u2019 Dinner as a whole, not all agree with. Kathy Griffin, speaking with The Washington Post after the dinner (she was in the room for Wolf\u2019s speech), said, \u201cWashington is so thin-skinned .\u201d (She would know .) Celebrities like Rosie O\u2019Donnell (whose cover photo is already an image of Wolf), Kumail Nanjiani, and Anthony Bourdain weighed in on social media, largely praising Wolf\u2019s performance\u2014though, of course, conservative commentators and trolls offered the inverse perspective on Twitter as well. See some of the most notable celebrity reactions, below.\n\nBut there was perhaps no response as pithy as Wolf's own, in response to Sean Spicer's tweet that \"Tonight's #WHCD was a disgrace.\" \"Thank you!\" she responded.\n\nAlso, while the president was off in Michigan, remarking, as always, on the size of the crowd at his rally, Wolf closed the night with a reminder: Flint, Michigan, still doesn\u2019t have water."}
{"label": false, "txt": "In this \"Greatest Hits\" album, we rediscover some of the earlier hits of these young twins. From the opening track, \"Your Heartless Void\", we hear a very early four track demo recorded before the girls were picked up by a major label. A truly telling song, we hear honest sincerity as Mary-Kate croons about the emptiness of modern romance and the delicate lines we all must walk to avoid a muddled, worthless existence. With Ashley-Olsen's gentle, yet telling classical guitar wafting in the background, we hear a sound eerily reminiscent of the early minimalist work of Lou Reed.\n\nOn the next two songs, \"Stabbing and Punching\" and \"Toothless Rookie,\" we are treated to the twins brief foray into the punk scene. Despite the repetitious brutal power chords and simplistic bridge-solos, the lyrics carry these songs onto a level formerly reserved only for the likes of The Ramones or even The Clash. \"Stabbing\" particularly stands out, with it's powerful ending of Mary-Kate screaming, \"You can rip out my heart, but you'll never take my soul you filthy [expletive]!\" It just doesn't get more meaningful than that, folks.\n\nThe next five tracks should be skipped as they are the weakest of the album. Mostly all of them are about riding ponies or how cute ponies are or where is a good place to watch ponies. Contextually these tracks are quite funny as they seem to be mocking the music of popular children's recording artists, but, unfortunately, they do seem to drone on a bit. We got the joke, okay?\n\nThe last three songs on the disc are certainly what made the girls the musical powerhouse they are today, as the production levels were greatly improved upon with the addition of Nigel Goodrich at the helms of these pop-classics. With, \"I Wanna Dance All Night,\" we hear Mary-Kate's club anthem about dancing at all-night raves and meeting men with money, power, and guile by the truckload. In the duo's, \"4 All My Posse,\" we see a different side of these girls as they share their take on gangsta rap. From what you hear, you could almost swear that they invented the style (\"I always frontin' on them packin' muthas\"/\"Get my piece out, then we see who got more druthas\"). The last track, a country song about a missing cat is simplicity, yet with such subtle sonic brilliance you might fall over and bump your head on a nearby chair.\n\nCertainly the best compilation in the last several years."}

As a family, Jolie says, she and the children are still recovering.\n\n\"We\u2019re all just healing from the events that led to the filing...They\u2019re not healing from divorce.

{"label": false, "txt": "Did Princess Charlotte recite her great ancestor\u2019s quote unknowingly? Is she advanced for her age?-Know the truths here!\n\nPrincess Charlotte\u2019s recital?\n\nNational Enquirer this week reported that 2-year-old Princess Charlotte, the youngest and only daughter of Prince William and Princess Kate Middleton had randomly recited her grand ancestor, Queen Victoria\u2019s quote. Queen Victoria had served as the Queen of England from 1837 to her death in 1901. The tabloid wrote that the little royal kid had shocked the palace staff members when she said what Queen Victoria used to say. Princess Charlotte was playing with a group of toddlers. After she finished playing, it seems that she looked at the royal helpers and said:\n\n\u201cThe important thing is not what they think of me, but what I think of them.\u201d\n\nThis quote was used by Queen Victoria in the 19th century.\n\nGossip Cop has spoken to a royal insider who laughed off at National Enquirer\u2019s story. The insider also denied any such incident in the palace. The source revealed that the story of the tabloid was completely untrue. It is quite unlikely that a kid as small as Princess Charlotte could put together the words to make such a complete and articulate sentence. And then to repeat what was said almost a century ago is very far-fetched.\n\nIs Princess Charlotte advanced for her age?\n\nLast September, Princess Charlotte had accompanied her parents and brother to Canada. At a royal garden party, Princess Charlotte had mingled with other children and toddlers. Princess Charlotte moved around confidently round the garden lawn and engaged herself with the surroundings. She was just 16 years old when she went to Canada for this tour. But it was clearly seen that instead of the wobbly walk of any her age child, Princess Charlotte was walking quite sturdily and also was seen running at one point in time. She preferred balloons over bubbles. At her age, children usually can only mimic simple tasks. But Princess Charlotte was spotted trying to fold her cardigan which is quite a complex task for such a small child.\n\nShe seemed to have a good vocabulary at that age. Princess Charlotte was heard saying: dada, flower, and pop (for the balloons). Paul Kilshaw, 53, the children\u2019s entertainer said:\n\n\u201cCharlotte asked for a flower, I think she said \u2018flower\u2019 because the other little girls were asking for flowers.\u201d\n\nShe was not copying others like the other children of her age would but was inventing her own plays. She went and sat on the dog Moose. She also ran towards the balloons and started a game of her own of repeatedly hitting at them.\n\nShe also hugged the black and white rabbit around; which reveals her emotional development of passing on love to an animal. A spokesperson for the Royal family said:\n\n\u201cThe Duke and Duchess are really pleased to have this opportunity to introduce their children to Canada and it\u2019s great that they have the chance to play with other children while they are here.\u201d\n\nThe show-stealer\n\nPrincess Charlotte is the show-stealer at most of the occasions. She seems to have inherited the dark Middleton eyes and her mother\u2019s darker hairs. But she is gradually acquiring the royal genes. Her face now resembles that of her great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II when she was small.\n\nPrince William dots on his little one and calls her \u2018the joy from the Heaven\u2019. Friends say that the little Princess has a bubbly and confident character, but talking about her daughter, Princess Kate had said:\n\n\u201cShe is very cute but she has got quite a feisty side. George has turned out to be a really lovely little boy. I hope George will keep Charlotte in order!\u201d\n\nPrincess Charlotte was the bridesmaid for her maternal aunt, Pippa Middleton at the latter\u2019s wedding on 20th May 2017 to financier James Matthews. Princess Charlotte looked cute in her tan-and-white dress by Pepa and Co. and had worn a floral headpiece. She was also holding a tiny basket and seemed quite fond of it. The mother-daughter duo made an amazing and beautiful pair!\n\nThe little Princess had also stolen the show at the Trooping the Colour Ceremony in June 2017 at the Royal Palace. She was in a pretty baby pink dress and stood on the balcony of the Buckingham Palace along with the other royal family members, enjoying the military specter.\n\nThe Princess\u2019 life at Anmer Hall\n\nFor the last two years, Princess Charlotte had stayed with her parents and brother at Anmer Hall, her parents\u2019 10-bedroom mansion at Norfolk, England. It was a simple life there with Kate managing the whole show alone. She had her royal servants and her children\u2019s nanny. An insider told People:\n\n\u201cThere was no formality at all. It really was like any other family sitting down to lunch, with George and Charlotte eating their homemade food in their high chairs and toddling around with their toys.\u201d\n\nHe added:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d think that Kate and William would have an army of staff to help them out, but it really was just them and the children,\u201d\n\nAnother family friend said:"}

Her fans responded on Twitter and Instagram, but they seemed to be paying more attention to arguing whether Rihanna was pregnant or just thick than to her musical success, as the Inquisitr reported. While social media was debating Rihanna\u2019s rumored baby bump, the songstress was celebrating at 1Oak Nightclub in New York City with her rumored billionaire beau, Saudi businessman Hassan Jameel, according to People.\n\nHassan and Rihanna kept the party going until after 3 a.m. at the club. The 29-year-old singer stunned in her third outfit of the evening, glittering in a gold crop top and gold jewelry. Rihanna received her award at the Grammys for Best Rap/Sung Performance for her collaboration with Kendrick Lamar.\n\nAlthough the songstress was immersed in celebrating with Jameel after the Grammys, she also reportedly became aware of the rumors soaring on Twitter and Instagram about her alleged pregnancy.

He began in films in the 1970s, playing a supporting role in Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1977) and a starring role in Days of Heaven (1978). He came to prominence with his role in the film American Gigolo (1980), which established him as a leading man and a sex symbol.[citation needed] He went on to star in many well-received films, including An Officer and a Gentleman (1982), The Cotton Club (1984), Pretty Woman (1990), Primal Fear (1996), Runaway Bride (1999), I'm Not There (2007), Arbitrage (2012) and Norman: The Moderate Rise and Tragic Fall of a New York Fixer (2016). For portraying Billy Flynn in the Academy Award-winning musical Chicago (2002), he won a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award as part of the cast.\n\nEarly life and education [ edit ]\n\nGere was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His mother, Doris Ann (n\u00e9e Tiffany, 1924\u20132016),[1] was a housewife. His father, Homer George Gere (1922-1999),[1][2] was an insurance agent for the Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company and had originally intended to become a minister.[3] Gere is their eldest son and second child.[1]\n\nHis paternal great-grandfather had changed the spelling of the surname from \"Geer\".[1] Both of his parents were Mayflower descendants; Gere's ancestors include Pilgrims Francis Eaton, John Billington, George Soule, Richard Warren, Degory Priest, Francis Cooke, and William Brewster.[1]\n\nIn 1967, Gere graduated from North Syracuse Central High School, where he excelled at gymnastics and music, and played the trumpet.[3] He attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst on a gymnastics scholarship, majoring in philosophy, but he left after two years and did not graduate.[3][4]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nStage [ edit ]\n\nGere first worked professionally at the Seattle Repertory Theatre and Provincetown Playhouse on Cape Cod in 1969, where he starred in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead. His first major acting role was in the original London stage version of Grease in 1973.[3] Gere was one of the first notable Hollywood actors to play a homosexual character, starring as a gay Holocaust victim in the 1979 Broadway production of Bent; Gere's performance earned him a Theatre World Award.\n\nFilm [ edit ]\n\nHe began appearing in Hollywood films in the mid-1970s. Originally cast in a starring role in The Lords of Flatbush (1974), he was replaced after fighting with another star of the film, Sylvester Stallone. He played a small but memorable part in Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1977) and starred in director Terrence Malick's well-reviewed drama Days of Heaven (1978).[3] The crime drama American Gigolo (1980) significantly boosted his profile and the romantic drama An Officer and a Gentleman (1982) (co-starring Debra Winger) cemented Gere's ascent to stardom, grossing almost $130 million[5] and winning two Academy Awards out of six nominations;[6] Gere himself received his first Golden Globe Award nomination.[7]\n\nFor the remainder of the 1980s, Gere appeared in films of varying critical and commercial reception.[8][9] His career rebounded with the releases of Internal Affairs (1990) and Pretty Woman (1990), the latter of which earned him his second Golden Globe Award nomination.[10] The 1990s saw Gere star in successful films including Sommersby (1993) (opposite Jodie Foster), Primal Fear (1996) and Runaway Bride (1999) (which reunited him with his Pretty Woman co-star Julia Roberts).[8] He also took a leading role in the action thriller The Jackal (1997), playing former IRA militant Declan Mulqueen; Gere affected an Irish accent for the role.[11]\n\nGere was named People magazine's \"Sexiest Man Alive\" in 1999. Not long thereafter, all in the same year, he appeared in the hit films The Mothman Prophecies (2002), Unfaithful (2002) and the Academy Award-winning musical film adaptation Chicago (2002),[3] for which he won his first Golden Globe Award. Gere's ballroom dancing drama Shall We Dance? (2004) was also a solid performer that grossed $170 million worldwide.[12] His next film, the book-to-screen adaptation Bee Season (2005), was a commercial failure.[13] Gere went on to co-star with Jesse Eisenberg and Terrence Howard in The Hunting Party (2007), a thriller in which he played a journalist in Bosnia. He next appeared with Christian Bale, Heath Ledger and Cate Blanchett in Todd Haynes' semi-biographical film about Bob Dylan, I'm Not There (2007); Gere was one of six actors to portray a variation of Dylan.\n\nGere co-starred with Diane Lane in the romantic drama Nights in Rodanthe (2008). The film was widely panned by critics[14] (making #74 on The Times Worst Films of 2008 list),[15] but grossed over $84 million worldwide.[16] The film is Gere's most recent to have been produced entirely by a major film studio. Gere has expressed belief that his politics regarding Tibet and China, the latter an important financial resource for major studios, have made him persona non grata within Hollywood.[17]\n\nGere embraced his apparent exile from Hollywood, appearing in independent features that garnered some of the best reviews of his career.[9] He was notably singled out for portraying businessman Robert Miller in Arbitrage (2012), earning his fourth Golden Globe Award nomination. Among many positive reviews,[18] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone cited Gere's performance as \"too good to ignore\" and \"an implosive tour de force\".[19] Lou Lumenick of the New York Post further wrote \"Richard Gere gives the best performance of his career\".[20][21] Also in 2012, Gere received the Golden Starfish Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Hamptons International Film Festival and the Career Achievement Award from the Hollywood Film Awards.[22][23] He had earlier received an award from the 34th Cairo International Film Festival in December 2010.[24]\n\nGere made a notable departure from his traditional screen persona with Norman: The Moderate Rise and Tragic Fall of a New York Fixer (2016). The political drama (written and directed by Academy Award-nominee Joseph Cedar) saw him portray Norman Oppenheimer, a \"small time Jewish 'fixer'\". Gere himself described the character as an embodiment of the \"sides of us we know are annoying and needy\".[25] His portrayal of Oppenheimer was called \"consistently, completely fascinating\" by RogerEbert.com[26] and was singled out as a worthy Academy Award contender by Variety.[27]\n\nPersonal life and activism [ edit ]\n\nGere had a relationship with actress Penelope Milford from 1971-78.[28] He had affairs with Priscilla Presley in 1983[29] and Kim Basinger in 1986.[30]\n\nGere was married to supermodel Cindy Crawford from 1991-95. In November 2002, he married model and actress Carey Lowell.[31] They have a son, Homer James Jigme Gere, who was born in February 2000 and is named for his grandfathers as well as the Tibetan name Jigme.[3][32]\n\nIn September 2013, the two separated after 11 years of marriage. The couple spent three years in highly contested divorce proceedings in New York County Supreme Court.[33][34] The case was settled in October 2016.[35]\n\nIn early April 2018, he married Spanish activist Alejandra Silva.[36] As per August 2018, the couple was expecting their first child.[37][38]\n\nGere was raised Methodist.[39][40]\n\nHis interest in Buddhism began when he was in his 20s.[41] He first studied Zen Buddhism[41] under Kyozan Joshu Sasaki. After having studied Zen for five or six years,[41] in 1978 he traveled with the Brazilian painter Sylvia Martins[42] to Nepal, where he met many Tibetan monks and lamas.[42] He then met the 14th Dalai Lama in India[41] and became a practicing Tibetan Buddhist of the Gelugpa school of Tibetan Buddhism[41] and an active supporter of the Dalai Lama.[3] Gere regularly visits Dharamshala, the headquarters of the Tibetan government-in-exile.[43]\n\nGere is also an advocate for human rights in Tibet. He is a co-founder of the Tibet House, creator of the Gere Foundation and Chairman of the Board of Directors for the International Campaign for Tibet. Because he supports the Tibetan Independence Movement, he is permanently banned from entering the People's Republic of China.[44][45]\n\nIn 1993, Gere was banned from being an Academy Award presenter after he denounced the Chinese government in his capacity while announcing the nominees.[46][47]\n\nIn September 2007, Gere called for the boycott of the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games to put pressure on China to make Tibet independent. He starred in a Free Tibet-themed Lancia commercial featuring the Lancia Delta.[48] On June 27, 2011, Gere meditated in Borobudur Temple,[49] in Indonesia.\n\nGere actively supports Survival International, an organization dedicated to protecting the rights and lands of tribal peoples throughout the world.[42]\n\nHe contributed some of his writing for the book, We Are One: A Celebration of Tribal Peoples, released in October 2009.[50] Gere discussed the persecution and loss of land of the Jummas as an example of a tragic story that repeats itself in different continents of the world, calling attention to the crime against their peaceful culture and how it reflects on humankind's own relationship with nature and capacity to survive.[51] The royalties from the sale of the book go to the indigenous rights organization, Survival International.\n\nGere campaigns for ecological causes and AIDS awareness. He currently serves on the board of directors for Healing the Divide, an organization that supports global initiatives to promote peace, justice and understanding.[52] He helped to establish the AIDS Care Home, a residential facility in India for women and children with AIDS, and also supports campaigns for AIDS awareness and education in that country. In 1999, he created the Gere Foundation India Trust to support a variety of humanitarian programs in India.[53]\n\nOn April 15, 2007, Gere appeared at an AIDS awareness rally in Jaipur, India. During a live news conference to promote condom use among truck drivers, he embraced Bollywood superstar Shilpa Shetty, dipped her, and kissed her several times on the cheek. As a result of that gesture, a local court ordered the arrest of Gere and Shetty, finding them in violation of public obscenity laws. Gere has said the controversy was \"manufactured by a small hard-line political party.\" About a month later, a two-judge bench headed by the Chief Justice of India, K. G. Balakrishnan, described the case as \"frivolous\" and believed that such complaints (against celebrities) were filed for \"cheap publicity\" and have brought a bad name to the country. They ruled that Gere would remain free to enter the country.[54]\n\nIn June 2008, Gere appeared in a Fiat commercial for the European market, driving a new Lancia Delta from Hollywood to Tibet. The commercial concluded with a tagline of \"the power to be different.\" The commercial was reported in Chinese newspapers, and Fiat apologized to China.[citation needed]\n\nGere's name is on some lists of famous vegetarians.[55][56] However, he is not a vegetarian.[57]\n\nIn 2016, he endorsed Hillary Clinton for president and donated $2,700 to her campaign.[58]\n\nGere is an accomplished musician, composing and performing the Pretty Woman piano theme and a guitar solo in Runaway Bride. He learned tap dance for Chicago and karate for An Officer and a Gentleman.[59]\n\nHonors and awards [ edit ]\n\nIn 1995, he was the President of the Jury at the 19th Moscow International Film Festival.[60]\n\nOn May 17, 2012, Albanian President, Bamir Topi awarded the \"Medal of Gratitude\" to Richard Gere with the citation: \"With gratitude and honor outstanding personality of the world art, great humanist and activist for the protection of human rights, which unmasked and the American public made known, and further, inhuman crimes, ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, in 1999, the Serbian military machine against the Albanian civilian population living in its land\".[61] On February 16, 2012, the George Eastman Museum honored Gere with the George Eastman Award for distinguished contribution to the art of film.[62]\n\nPolitical views [ edit ]\n\nIn 2010, Gere stated that the war in Iraq wasn't supported by the American people and that the George W. Bush administration \"bullied\" Americans into the decision. He called George W. Bush a very \"poor president\".[63]\n\n\"I'm very sorry about what the U.S. has done in Iraq. This war has been a tragedy for everyone. I hope that the people of Iraq can rebuild their country,\" Gere said in a press conference held on the sidelines of the 34th Cairo International Film Festival.[64]\n\nFilmography [ edit ]\n\nAwards and nominations [ edit ]"}

According to Gossip Cop, it\u2019s the latter.\n\nThe rumor-busting website says that Stefani and Shelton are not at war over Kohanski, and Stefani\u2019s rep told them that reports of a wedding being called off are simply untrue. The couple isn\u2019t anywhere near a split, and their relationship is not \u201con the rocks.\u201d\n\nThe truth about Stefani and Shelton is that they are happy and spent time together over the holidays having an outdoor adventure with her three sons, Kingston, Zuma, and Apollo.\n\n#merrychristmas \u2764\ufe0f?\u2764\ufe0f??gx A post shared by Gwen Stefani (@gwenstefani) on Dec 25, 2017 at 10:34am PST\n\nUS Weekly reports that just before the new year, Stefani documented their Oklahoma outings via multiple Instagram stories. Shelton and the boys all rocked camouflage clothes, and in one clip, the kids are roasting marshmallows and tossing wood on the fire.\n\nBack indoors, they continued their holiday festivities by goofing off in pajamas in front of the Christmas tree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGwen Stefani told Ryan Seacrest in an interview in early December, that since she had the kids this Christmas, she and Blake Shelton were going to split their time between Oklahoma and Los Angeles."}

The high-profile and public affair between Camilla and Prince Charles is something the boys will never truly forget. Understandably, they have had a rocky relationship with Camilla over the years. Some years have been better than others, but it\u2019s impossible to completely erase the dark history between each other.\n\nLet\u2019s take a quick look at the revealing details behind the relationship between Prince William, Prince Harry, and Camilla, including a major sign of progress for their relationship (No. 9). We\u2019ll also discuss the surprisingly blunt statement from Prince William (No. 12).\n\n1. William was resistant to meeting Camilla\n\nPrince William was wary of Camilla as a teenager. | Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images Prince William was wary of Camilla as a teenager. | Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn the summer of 1997, two months before Diana\u2019s death, Charles sat his kids down to talk to them about Camilla. He explained their relationship from his point of view, but Diana had already tainted the mere thought of Camilla for the boys. William was especially resistant to meeting her. Charles did not push the relationship on the boys because he wanted them to warm up to her and knew they were aware of the trouble Camilla had caused Charles and Diana.\n\nNext: William took the initiative.\n\n2. William eventually set up a meeting with Camilla to clear the air\n\nWilliam agreed to meet with Camilla in 1998. | Joel Robine/AFP/Getty Images William agreed to meet with Camilla in 1998. | Joel Robine/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAfter taking a break from pushing the boys to meet Camilla, Charles tried once more. In 1998, William finally agreed to set up a meeting with Camilla so he could learn a little more about her. Afterward, both agreed that things went well. However, Camilla was not yet out of the woods with William. There was still a lot he wanted to know.\n\nNext: The brothers did not meet her at the same time.\n\n3. Harry let William get to know her first\n\nHarry\u2019s meeting with Camilla was more casual. | Carl de Souza/AFP/Getty Images Harry\u2019s meeting with Camilla was more casual. | Carl de Souza/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHarry did not attend the meet up with William. Instead, he met Camilla a few weeks later over tea. The two were at Highgrove, Charles\u2019 home. Camilla\u2019s children were present as well, and it was reportedly more casual than her meeting with William. Tensions were not as high, possibly since William had gotten to know Camilla a bit and filled Harry in.\n\nNext: Diana made no bones about her feelings.\n\n4. Diana made her feelings about Camilla clear to her sons\n\nLeft: Princess Diana in Australia in 1996 | Patrick Riviere/Getty Images, Right: Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall in 2017 | WPA Pool/Pool/Getty Images Left: Princess Diana in Australia in 1996 | Patrick Riviere/Getty Images, Right: Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall in 2017 | WPA Pool/Pool/Getty Images\n\nIt was evident that Diana was not OK with the affair between Charles and Camilla. She quickly confronted Camilla about it and reportedly let her sons know, too. She referred to him as \u201cCharles\u2019 lady\u201d to her sons. The boys immediately got a bad taste in their mouths about Camilla, which likely led to a years-long, up-and-down relationship with their father\u2019s current wife.\n\nNext: Things did not improve too quickly.\n\n5. The relationship was still rocky at Charles\u2019 50th birthday party\n\nPrince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, formerly Camilla Parker Bowles at their wedding. | Chris Ison/AFP/Getty Images Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, formerly Camilla Parker Bowles at their wedding. | Chris Ison/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe boys organized a birthday party for Charles when he was turning 50. They made the nice gesture of inviting Camilla to sit with Charles. However, it\u2019s been reported that their relationship was still very tentative at the time. The boys wanted to make progress with Camilla but still felt shadowed by how she had split up their mother and father.\n\nNext: This person may have had an influence on the boys, too.\n\n6. The queen may have delayed the brothers\u2019 acceptance of Camilla\n\nBritain\u2019s Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Harry share a joke at Prince Charles and his bride Camilla\u2019s wedding. | Alastair Grant/AFP/Getty Images Britain\u2019s Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Harry share a joke at Prince Charles and his bride Camilla\u2019s wedding. | Alastair Grant/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAt Charles\u2019 party, Camilla sat with him, and the whole family celebrated his milestone birthday. The one missing person? The queen. She refused to attend the event knowing Camilla would be present. The queen had still not accepted her son\u2019s infidelity. Her hesitation toward letting Camilla join the family may have fueled additional hesitation from William and Harry.\n\nNext: Charles took a big step with this invitation.\n\n7. A family vacation built some connection\n\nEveryone reportedly had a good time on vacation. | Rodrigo Buendia/AFP/Getty Images Everyone reportedly had a good time on vacation. | Rodrigo Buendia/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWilliam, Harry, and Charles were set to fly to Greece to spend a vacation together. Charles invited Camilla to attend. She accepted the invitation and flew to Greece with the family. While it is unclear exactly what happened there, it appeared that the boys enjoyed the time spent with their father and Camilla.\n\nNext: Things were looking up for Camilla and the boys.\n\n8. By the time Camilla and Charles married, her relationship with the boys had greatly improved\n\nEveryone was smiles by the time the wedding rolled around. | Hugo Burnand/Pool/Getty Images Everyone was smiles by the time the wedding rolled around. | Hugo Burnand/Pool/Getty Images\n\nCamilla wed Charles in 2005. After the wedding, Harry had nothing but good things to say about his new stepmother. \u201c[Camilla is] a wonderful woman who makes my father very, very happy,\u201d Harry said in an interview with BBC. \u201cWilliam and I love her to bits.\u201d He also reinforced that they do not see her as a wicked stepmother.\n\nNext: William played a big role in his father\u2019s second wedding.\n\n9.

When Charles asked, William accepted without much hesitation.\n\nNext: This gift from Camilla symbolized a harmonious family.\n\n10. Camilla gave Kate Middleton a gift at William and Kate\u2019s wedding\n\nKate Middleton received a thoughtful wedding gift from Camilla. | Charlie Crowhurst/Getty Images Kate Middleton received a thoughtful wedding gift from Camilla. | Charlie Crowhurst/Getty Images\n\nWhen William and Kate tied the knot in 2011, Camilla gave Kate a special wedding gift. It was a gold charm bracelet with each of their initials engraved on either side. Kate sported the bracelet on multiple occasions, as if to say that she was happy to have Camilla in the family. It seemed as though the feud between Charles\u2019 children and Camilla had finally ended.\n\nNext: \u2026 but things have not been perfect since.\n\n11. The brothers were silent at Camilla\u2019s 70th birthday celebration\n\nPrince Charles and Camilla | Tim Rooke/Pool/Getty Images Prince Charles and Camilla | Tim Rooke/Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe Daily Mail recently reported that at Camilla\u2019s 70th birthday celebration, no words were said by the brothers. Most people expected the brothers to make a public statement about their stepmother, whom they had once seemed to fully patch things up with. Instead, they stayed silent, leading people to question whether things had changed between the three.\n\nNext: This statement from William hints at an unstable relationship.\n\n12. William made it clear that his children only have two grandmothers\n\nCamilla is not \u201cgrandma\u201d to George and Charlotte. | Patrik Stollarz/AFP/Getty Images Camilla is not \u201cgrandma\u201d to George and Charlotte. | Patrik Stollarz/AFP/Getty Images\n\n2017 marked 20 years since the tragic death of William\u2019s mother, Princess Diana. In Diana, Our Mother: Her Life and Legacy, William made it clear that Camilla was not a grandmother to his two children. \u201c\u2026 [I] just try and remind them that there are two grandmothers \u2014 there were two grandmothers \u2014 in their lives,\u201d he said. William did not mention Camilla when speaking about the childrens\u2019 grandmothers, even though she was their grandfather\u2019s wife and had known them since birth, just like Kate\u2019s mother.\n\nNext: It appears the tides have turned.\n\n13. More than a decade later, the relationship \u2018has changed\u2019\n\n(L-R) Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry, Prince Charles, Prince of Wales and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge | Ben A. Pruchnie/Getty Images (L-R) Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry, Prince Charles, Prince of Wales and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge | Ben A. Pruchnie/Getty Images\n\nA source later confirmed to the Daily Mail that things have not been the same between Camilla and the boys in recent years. \u201cThey are not close to Camilla anymore,\u201d said a friend of the royal family. \u201cThe relationship has changed.\u201d Other friends of the family have backed up those claims. One person, an old friend of Diana\u2019s, said, \u201cIt was pretty clear they don\u2019t have a good word for Camilla.\u201d\n\nNext: The boys don\u2019t want Camilla gaining this role.\n\n14. They likely do not want Camilla to be named queen\n\nHarry and William have the public\u2019s support on this one. | Carl de Souza/AFP/Getty Images Harry and William have the public\u2019s support on this one. | Carl de Souza/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe public has made it clear that when Charles is passed the throne and becomes king, Camilla should not be queen. That was supposed to be Diana\u2019s role, and the public remains loyal to her. They have also declined to call Camilla \u201cPrincess of Wales\u201d because that was Diana\u2019s title. Since the boys have seemed to distance themselves from Camilla, it\u2019s likely that they do not want her to be queen, either. Rumors have swirled that the feud has heated up again since it was suggested that William and Kate take the role, but those rumors have not been confirmed.\n\nNext: This one thing could be a big reason for their resistance.\n\n15. The boys never fully came to terms with their mother\u2019s death\n\nDiana meant a lot to her sons. | Johnny Eggitt/AFP/Getty Images Diana meant a lot to her sons. | Johnny Eggitt/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn Diana, Our Mother, Harry and William went into detail about how little they actually cried over their mother. Harry made a comment that he still felt like there was much more he had to let out about her death. Since the boys seemed to never properly mourn their mother, they may have never had that closure that would allow them to let another mother into their lives. Plus, Camilla caused Diana so much pain that not having the closure of her death might make it even more difficult to let someone like that in.\n\nNext: Is there already a feud between Camilla and Meghan Markle?\n\n16. For starters: Why would they fight?\n\nNot everyone is ready for Markle to join the royal family. | Chris Jackson/Getty Images Not everyone is ready for Markle to join the royal family. | Chris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nMeghan and Camilla can\u2019t possibly know each other very well. And Camilla recently gushed over the engagement to Prince Harry. So why would a feud be on the horizon? As one online rag alleges, the Duchess of Cornwall has never thought the American actress was worthy of marrying into the royal family.\n\nNext: Trying to decipher how a feud might have started.\n\n17. Why would Camilla think of Meghan this way?\n\nCamilla doesn\u2019t like that Meghan is American. | STEFAN ROUSSEAU/AFP/Getty Images Camilla doesn\u2019t like that Meghan is American. | STEFAN ROUSSEAU/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFor starters, Camilla supposedly isn\u2019t fond of Meghan because she is American and does not come from a royal background. (Camilla allegedly felt the same way about Kate Middleton entering the royal family, so there could potentially be some truth to this rumor.) It is also rumored that Camilla wasn\u2019t a fan of Meghan dumping her boyfriend of two years the second she met Harry, seeing it as a social climbing move. (Something Meghan\u2019s stepsister has also accused her of.)\n\nNext: Seeing if a fight interrupted the engagement timeline.\n\n18. Was the engagement really postponed?\n\nWas the engagement secretly postponed? | Kensington Royal via Instagram Was the engagement secretly postponed? | Kensington Royal via Instagram\n\nAccording to Inquisitr, Camilla flew to Toronto in the summer of 2017 to tell Meghan in person that she should not accept a marriage proposal from Harry. And that, if Meghan accepted, the Camilla would \u201cmake life difficult\u201d for her. While Harry and Meghan announced their engagement later in the year, it was alleged that Camilla\u2019s meddling pushed things back.\n\nNext: Examining the lengths Camilla might have gone to.\n\n19. Has Camilla continued to cause trouble?\n\nSources claim that there\u2019s drama at the palace. | Ben Birchall/AFP/Getty Images Sources claim that there\u2019s drama at the palace. | Ben Birchall/AFP/Getty Images\n\nNew Idea claims that Camilla didn\u2019t stop at trying to sabotage the engagement. The site alleges that the duchess is responsible for at least 14 key staffers at Buckingham Palace resigning, which in turn postponed the early stages of planning the wedding. It\u2019s also said that Prince Harry was livid and supposedly confronted his stepmother about the matter. (Of course, this is all from \u201cwell-placed sources\u201d and it isn\u2019t completely clear if this rumor is true.)\n\nNext: Relating the allegations to previous rumors.\n\n20. Has Camilla meddled like this before?\n\nCamilla may have tried to meddle in William and Kate\u2019s wedding plans. | CARL DE SOUZA/AFP/Getty Images Camilla may have tried to meddle in William and Kate\u2019s wedding plans. | CARL DE SOUZA/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAs it turns out, this isn\u2019t the first time that Camilla has been accused of trying to ruin a royal wedding. Gossip columns pointed their fingers at her back in 2011 for allegedly trying to interfere with Prince William and Kate Middleton\u2019s relationship. It was said that Camilla had confidantes leak lies about Kate to the tabloids in order to paint her in a bad light.\n\nNext: Speaking of Duchess Catherine \u2026\n\n21. What does Kate think?\n\nIs there some plotting going on behind the scenes? | Arthur Edwards-WPA Pool/Getty Images Is there some plotting going on behind the scenes? | Arthur Edwards-WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nHere\u2019s where things get interesting. One gossip rag claims that the Duchess of Cambridge and the future royal have joined forces to kick Camilla out of the royal family. Another gossip site, Gossip Cop, says that story is untrue because it has \u201cinside sources\u201d telling it the claim is 100% not true. (Although if you read the bottom of that post, it appears this could just be a case of two tabloids fighting with each other.)\n\nNext: Only one questions remains \u2026\n\n22. Will we ever know the truth?\n\nThese rumors will be in the tabloids for years to come. | Andy Stenning/AFP/Getty Images These rumors will be in the tabloids for years to come. | Andy Stenning/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUnless Meghan unleashes a right hook that connects with Camilla\u2019s jaw, we\u2019ll likely never know if the two are actually at odds or not. Surely there will be a million photographers trying to catch Camilla glaring in Meghan\u2019s direction at the wedding. Or body language experts deciphering how uncomfortable they look standing next to each other. But for now, all we have is the good ol\u2019 rumor mill.\n\nAdditional reporting by Chelena Goldman.\n\nCheck out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!"}
{"label": false, "txt": "Rumors that Kim Kardashian wants her surrogate to carry triplets for her have been proven false by comments she made herself.\n\nThe story began in Closer, where a a report suggested that Kardashian wanted to have triplets as a birthday surprise for her husband, Kanye West. The article, headlined: \u201cKim: \u2018Surprising Kanye With Triplet News Will Save Our Marriage,'\u201d also indicated that their marriage was crumbling, though that too appears to be unfounded.\n\nIn the piece, sources claimed that Kardashian is \u201ckeen to set the wheels in motion for her next surrogacy.\" Alleged insiders said that she intends to \u201ccomplete her family with triplets.\u201d They went on to frame it as a birthday gift, claiming that she is \u201cdetermined to surprise\u201d West \u201con his 41st birthday... with the news that their surrogate is ready to get pregnant again.\u201d\n\n\u201cKim\u2019s been racking her brains over what to give Kanye for his birthday, and she says that giving him more children would be the best present he could ever wish for,\" the source claimed. After his recent public meltdown, Kardashian reportedly believed that \u201cthe best thing for him is to focus on family, and what better way than celebrating baby news?\u201d\n\nThe source explained that the plan was for Kardashian's surrogate to \u201cbe implanted with three embryos to maximize their chances\u201d of conceiving a bigger family. They added that West \u201claughed when Kim suggested triplets, but she knows he\u2019s always wanted a big family\u2026 so she\u2019s sure he\u2019ll be ecstatic with her decision.\u201d\n\nThey even included the alleged reaction of Kourtney and Khloe Kardashian, saying the sisters \u201chave warned [Kim] that it could backfire, given that it\u2019s such a big step to take without discussing it properly with Kanye.\u201d\n\nIt turns out there's not much to back these strange claims, despite the tabloid's insistence. A report by Gossip Cop points out that Kardashian herself talked about children in March when she did an interview with Elle. The reality star specifically said she doesn't want more than four kids.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I could handle more than that. My time is spread really thin,\u201d she said at the time. In May, she talked about it again on Live with Kelly and Ryan.\n\n\u201cI would have maybe one more,\" she said.\n\nWhile the rumors about Kardashian seem to be false, it is true that surrogates have a high chance of gestating twins, triplets or more. According to a report on simplesurrogacy.com, several factors of the surrogacy process combined with advancements in in vitro fertilization technology make it likely for multiple embryos to mature."}
{"label": false, "txt": "THE MOST NOTICEABLE thing about Angelina Jolie Pitt\u2014apart from her almost preternatural physical presence\u2014is that nearly everywhere she goes she turns up more or less unattended (unless, of course, you count husband Brad Pitt and their brood of six). Arriving for an interview at a West Hollywood hotel suite to promote By the Sea, her upcoming movie with Pitt, she\u2019s trailed only by a lone bodyguard\u2014she doesn\u2019t employ a manager or even a publicist. A few weeks earlier, photos of the Jolie-Pitt clan\u2019s visit to a Subway in Glendale, California, had been splashed across multiple websites (\u201cThey\u2019re just like us!\u201d), but the trip from which Jolie Pitt has returned just before the interview\u2014an outing to a lakeside retreat the couple owns near Pitt\u2019s hometown of Springfield, Missouri\u2014had gone entirely unnoticed. (\u201cIt\u2019s a real Midwestern family kind of place,\u201d says Tom Brokaw, who got to know Jolie Pitt during the making of her most recent film, Unbroken. \u201cHis whole family comes down, cousins, you name it.\u201d) Likewise, the couple\u2019s wedding ceremony at their ch\u00e2teau in the south of France in August 2014 was not followed by a romantic getaway featuring the typical telescopic paparazzi shots of sunbathing on a yacht. The two went back to work almost immediately, shooting the new film together on a tiny island in Malta, \u201cwhile our children ran around the set,\u201d says Pitt. \u201cThat this became our honeymoon is just f\u2014ing funny.\u201d WSJ. Magazine November 2015 All this under-the-radar normalcy would not be noteworthy in the least if the two stars weren\u2019t the most staggeringly high-profile Hollywood couple since Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton (except with only three divorces between them and not nearly as much booze or bling). This month, in By the Sea, they\u2019ll appear together for the first time in a decade, since the action-packed romp Mr. and Mrs. Smith introduced them to the world as a couple onscreen and (subsequently, they insist) off. Though the new film, by Jolie Pitt\u2019s own account, is a \u201csmall\u201d one, it will likely attract a lot of interest in the media juggernaut known as Brangelina\u2014especially since the story involves a couple whose marriage is in deep crisis. The movie, set in an isolated seaside hotel in France, lays them emotionally bare in a way they\u2019ve rarely been seen before, and certainly not together. \u201cIt was not easy,\u201d says Jolie Pitt. \u201cWe just had to be brave and say, \u2018OK, honey, we\u2019re strong enough to do this; let\u2019s somehow use this to make us stronger.\u2019 \u201d Jolie Pitt wrote the script, her first, not long after her mother, Marcheline Bertrand, died in 2007. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know if I could make film and I didn\u2019t think I could write film, so I wrote with a certain amount of freedom,\u201d she says. \u201cI gave myself the task that it would be about grief and how different people react to and process it.\u201d In one scene, the local barkeep (played by a remarkable French actor, Niels Arestrup) talks to Pitt\u2019s character, who is trying to restart a foundering writing career, about forcing himself to love his terminally ill wife enough to let her go. \u201cThat\u2019s me speaking about my mother,\u201d Jolie Pitt says. \u201cI think maybe his character came from the purest place inside me.\u201d The actress-writer-director Angelina Jolie Pitt occupies a rarefied station in contemporary culture, at once a Hollywood icon and compassionate humanitarian. A film by MediaStorm The most difficult scenes of the film were made harder by the fact that \u201cwe had to stay in our corners, like boxers, and not be husband and wife,\u201d Jolie Pitt says. \u201cIt was very hard to do those scenes without Brad and I taking care of each other. Normally in between takes, you\u2019d make sure that the other\u2019s OK, but we had to be able to really get ugly.\u201d At the end of the day, she adds, it was the kids who kept them from staying in character. \u201cThat might have been an absolute disaster. But as soon as we got home, it was bedtime stories, children\u2019s needs and problems, the fights they\u2019d had during the day. We had to immediately snap back to something that was uniting and positive and loving.\u201d WSJ. Magazine 2015 Innovators Angelina Jolie Pitt\n\nRichard Serra\n\nKarl Ove Knausgaard\n\nMiuccia Prada\n\nThomas Heatherwick\n\nStewart Butterfield\n\nMark Parker For Pitt,By the Sea marked the first time he\u2019d been directed by a woman, let alone his own wife, but he professes not to see the difference. The main thing, he says, is that the director has \u201cthe reins on the story and taste in the telling\u201d so that the actors have \u201cfreedom to explore.\u201d In his case, he adds, \u201cMy director has an elegant intuition for character. And anyway, I trust her with my life.\u201d Occasionally, though, their husband-wife ease on set was a double-edged sword. \u201cBeing a couple, we have that shorthand that can be communicated in a look. Conversely, it means I knew immediately if she felt a take stunk.\u201d If By the Sea\u2014the third feature film Jolie Pitt has directed\u2014could not be further in intent or plot from the couple\u2019s comic debut, it\u2019s consistent with Jolie Pitt\u2019s pattern of taking on risky projects. As a director and screenwriter, she came out of the box in 2011 with In the Land of Blood and Honey, a romantic drama set in a place\u20141990s war-torn Bosnia\u2014most Americans had managed to ignore. As a rule, actors who direct for the first time tend toward slightly less complicated fare; even Tom Hanks went with a comedy/drama about a one-hit-wonder rock band in the 1960s. Jolie Pitt\u2019s period piece touched on issues of rape and captivity, was cast with local unknowns and was filmed simultaneously in Bosnian and English. Though ultimately well received, the film was hardly an obvious bet. \u201cShe called me to take a look at the script and after about 25 pages, I remember thinking, Wait, I have to go back and read this again,\u201d says Graham King, the Oscar-winning producer (The Departed, Argo) who ended up investing in and producing the film with Jolie Pitt. \u201cI did not expect Bosnia.

These are the most painful, personal memories in these men\u2019s lives. But she threw her whole heart and soul into it.\u201d Hillenbrand says she was reassured that her book was in the right hands when Jolie Pitt, whom she now refers to as \u201ca sister,\u201d called to inquire about the uniforms of a high school track team Zamperini had raced against in the 1930s. Hillenbrand, known for her meticulous period research, had no idea what they looked like. \u201cBut I knew from the question that I could relax. It was a pleasing question to get even though it was impossible!\u201d\n\nC\u00e9line dress, $3,250, C\u00e9line Madison Avenue, New York\n\nJolie Pitt was equally painstaking about By the Sea\u2019s 1970s period wardrobe\u2014including her oversize sunglasses, which Pitt\u2019s character, Roland, keeps righting for his wife after she tosses them, a lot, onto tables, a mini pas de deux Jolie Pitt took from their actual marriage. \u201cBrad hates that I always scratch my glasses,\u201d she says, adding that in the film, the gesture shows that Roland still cares for her character, Vanessa. \u201cEven when he wants to punch her in the face, he still fixes her glasses!\u201d In life, Jolie Pitt says, \u201cI wear the same thing every day, very much like now.\u201d As she speaks, she\u2019s in fairly minimalist garb (skinny black pants, a camel jersey T-shirt and camel flats) with equally minimal makeup (a bit of eyeliner) and jewelry (a Cartier tank watch, a diamond-encrusted gold wedding band). The far more self-conscious Vanessa, on the other hand, sports a collection of elaborate negligees and peignoirs, frilly 1970s blouses and midi skirts, and full-on eye makeup, including lashes, which we watch her apply each morning. According to King, Jolie Pitt\u2019s attention to detail extends well beyond wardrobe. When she first approached him about In the Land of Blood and Honey, she was \u201cextraordinarily well prepared,\u201d he says. \u201cShe turned up in my office with the location, photos, storyboards, casting information. The train was leaving the station. When she said, \u2018I\u2019d love for you to produce this movie,\u2019 I was already hooked.\u201d He also came to admire her \u201chands-on\u201d approach. \u201cWhether it\u2019s interviews, photo shoots or directing films, she gets involved herself,\u201d he says. \u201cAngie does not send people into meetings.

Haider Ackermann coat, $2,500, haiderackermann.com Even before Blood and Honey and Unbroken, Jolie Pitt was attracted to stories about real-life characters and bravery under all sorts of fire. Mariane Pearl, widow of Daniel Pearl, the Wall Street Journal reporter who was kidnapped and murdered in Pakistan in 2002, was thrilled when Jolie Pitt signed on to play her in A Mighty Heart, a 2007 film adaptation of her memoir. As early as 2004, Jolie Pitt optioned Franklin and Winston, Jon Meacham\u2019s best-selling portrait of the genuine and all-important friendship between Roosevelt and Churchill during World War II. She says Anthony Hopkins has been attached to the project, as Churchill, for years but that she herself has no desire to play a role or direct. \u201cI just wanted to see it get made, because I have a thing for those guys. It would give me an excuse to work on it and be around the characters.\u201d HBO has expressed interest in the project, but more imminent on Jolie Pitt\u2019s to-do list is a film for Netflix, First They Killed My Father, which begins shooting this month. Based on a memoir by Cambodian author and human rights activist Loung Ung, it chronicles her survival under the murderous Khmer Rouge. The whole family will relocate to Cambodia for the shoot, during which Jolie Pitt\u2019s 14-year-old son, Maddox, whom she adopted from Cambodia when he was barely 1 (Pitt subsequently adopted him as well), will help with the research. \u201cHe\u2019s going to sit with me while we watch the videos and re-create such a difficult time in his people\u2019s history,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s important that the whole family understands all that it means to him and to us.\u201d The Cambodian connection is both familial and visceral. Not only is it the place where Jolie Pitt had the \u201cepiphany\u201d that she could be somebody\u2019s mother, but her initial experience in the country (while shooting Lara Croft: Tomb Raider) led to her lasting connection to the United Nations, for which she currently serves as special envoy for refugee issues. \u201cI\u2019d been expecting people who were bitter and unhappy,\u201d she says, \u201cand instead, they were full of light and kindness and humor.\u201d She spent much of the shoot avoiding land mines, meeting land mine victims, learning about refugees. \u201cI thought, There is so much I\u2019m not aware of, and it\u2019s a big world out there and I really need to educate myself.\u201d She came back, did a lot of research and found herself deeply affected by the vast number of people around the world displaced by war. When she asked the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to put together a learning trip (which she paid for herself), she ended up in Tanzania, at a camp where many refugees were missing limbs. \u201cI called my mom from the airport and said, \u2018I am never going to take my life for granted, I\u2019m never going to complain.

We\u2019ve got EXCLUSIVE details on why Chris is enjoying the feud and anticipating more disses.\n\nThe rap war between Pusha T and Drake just got super ugly as the 41-year-old claimed in a new diss track that Drizzy is a deadbeat dad to a secret son with former porn star Sophie Brussaux. Chris Brown is right there with all of us hoping Drake\u2019s got a clap back track coming, but in the meantime he\u2019s pulled up some popcorn and is having a blast watching their drama. \u201cChris is on Team Pusha and believes him when he says that Drake may be ignoring his own baby. Chris is loving all the drama between Pusha and Drake. He is glad that for once, he is not in the middle of this feud,\u201d a source close to the 29-year-old singer tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\n\u201cChris can\u2019t stop laughing at Pusha\u2019s track, from the black face pic to calling Drake a deadbeat, Chris thinks it is all hilarious. Chris feels bad for the baby and thinks Drake is being irresponsible. If the kid really is Drake\u2019s, Chris thinks he should man up quickly and take a more active role in the child\u2019s life. Chris feels if the baby is not Drake\u2019s, then he should probably let that be known pretty quickly too. Chris hopes another diss track is on the way from Drake defending himself either way,\u201d our insider continues. So far, Drake hasn\u2019t responded to Pusha\u2019s claims that he\u2019s got a secret son and is a deadbeat dad. His reps aren\u2019t commenting on the issue either.\n\nChris is a daddy to his precious daughter Royalty, who just turned four. He can\u2019t understand why if Drake is really a father to son Adonis like Pusha claims, that he isn\u2019t stepping up. \u201cChris believes that Royalty is the best thing that ever happened to him. His daughter has kept him grounded, stable, happy and motivated. He can\u2019t imagine life without her and he can\u2019t think of why Drake would turn his back on his baby too. It\u2019s a huge mistake. Chris feels if Drake denies his own baby then he is missing out on one of the most wonderful things in life, being a father,\u201d our source adds.\n\nBut, aside from being a father, why else would Chris be siding with Pusha T? Well if you recall, both he and Drake were romantically linked to Rihanna. While Drake and Rihanna\u2019s romance was never confirmed, Chris\u2019 dramatic relationship with the \u201cUmbrella\u201d singer was pretty high profile. Plus, back in 2012, Drake and Chris were allegedly involved in an altercation that turned violent at WIP nightclub in NYC. And, it was supposedly over Rihanna. Yikes! Can\u2019t we all just get along?!"}

Lo thinks Rodriguez is \u201cthe one,\u201d but she doesn\u2019t want to put too much pressure on him since they have both been married before. But, that isn\u2019t keeping her from looking at rings and pointing out what she likes when they walk past an expensive jewelry store.\n\n#FeelingTheLove #GroupHug #FamilyTime A post shared by Alex Rodriguez (@arod) on May 19, 2018 at 9:53pm PDT\n\nLopez tied the knot for the first time back in 1997 when she married Ojani Noa, but they divorced just one year later. Her second marriage to Cris Judd lasted for only two years, 2001 to 2003. Then, she got married a third time back in 2004 to singer Marc Anthony. They share two children \u2013 10-year-old twins Emme and Max \u2013 but the relationship ended when they parted ways in 2014.\n\nAs for Rodriguez, he has been married just once. He wed Cynthia Scurtis in 2002, but the couple divorced in 2008. They also share two children, 14-year-old Natasha and 10-year-old Ella.\n\nBut even though they have both done the marriage thing before, it doesn\u2019t mean they are against trying it again. Sources say Rodriguez isn\u2019t opposed to getting married, and he and Lopez have talked about it.\n\n\u201cHe and Jennifer have talked at great length about tying the knot.

And, J. Lo\u2019s friend and World of Dance co-star Jenna Dewan believes that a ring is in the near future for Lopez and Rodriguez.\n\nDewan recently admitted that she is sure an engagement is happening soon, and she isn\u2019t the only one. Another World of Dance star, Ne-Yo, says that if you have ever seen the two of them together, you would know that an engagement is pretty much the next step. He went on to say that they are \u201cannoyingly cute,\u201d to the point that you want them to just stop touching each other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInsiders say that Lopez and Rodriguez\u2019s kids are also ready for them to tie the knot, and the couple is happy that all of the children get along and have accepted their new family.

{"label": false, "txt": "Jim Carrey has responded to a new report that says he and the late Robin Williams were engaged in a \"bitter feud.\" The original report seems to stem from a new biography about Williams that was written by New York Times journalist Dave Itzkoff. In Itzkoff's book, it's touched on that the late comedian felt threatened by Carrey's success in the 1990s. To make matters worse, Robin Williams was reportedly upset that Jim Carrey took over on the role of the Riddler in 1995's Batman Forever after he turned the role down.\n\nThe report in question comes from Radar Online, which isn't always 100 percent accurate in all of its reporting. Jim Carrey has made a statement calling the entire report fabricated and made up after a tiny blurb was mentioned in Dave Itzkoff's biography. Carrey acknowledges that there might have been some insecurity on the part of Williams, but there was absolutely no feud. Carrey explains.\n\n\"RadarOnline is completely off base and creating a feud that didn't exist. Robin may have expressed insecurity about me and my rise to success but I have never had anything but the greatest respect for him and his genius. He was also always respectful to me in person. He called me Maestro and I called him Billy the Kid. Let's get it straight. There's no feud if one side isn't aware of it.\"\n\nIn addition to his statement on the so-called feud with Robin Williams, Jim Carrey took a break from painting the Trump administration and shared a new painting that he did of the late comedian on social media. The painting is done in Carrey's unique style and features Robin Williams with a radiating golden glow around him. Carrey continued to heap praise on Williams in the caption of the photo. He says.\n\n\"Robin Williams' mind was a quantum computer. He was the fastest gun in the West. I loved, respected and admired his brilliance - always.\"\n\nThis August will be the fourth anniversary of Robin Williams' death. Williams committed suicide on August 14th. The comedian was diagnosed with diffuse Lewy body dementia, which reportedly caused him to lose some of the energy that he was best known for. Williams was misdiagnosed with Parkinson's disease, suffered paranoia, hallucinations, and blank moments at the end of his life. In addition, he didn't feel like he could be funny anymore, according to Itzkoff's biography.\n\nAs for Jim Carrey, he's mostly been focusing on painting as a way of social protest after being cleared in the death of his girlfriend. Carrey is a harsh critic of President Trump and creates very unflattering pieces of artwork that portray the president and his administration. While it could be said that he may be in a feud with Trump, he was never in a \"bitter feud\" with the late great Robin Williams. You can read the rest of Carrey's comments on Williams at Gossip Cop."}

Last June, fans were shocked when Kylie and Travis debuted their new matching butterfly tattoos, but now it all makes sense. She got the butterfly to symbolize her relationship with the father of her baby girl!\n\nWhat's more surprising is Kylie got a tattoo of an insect that she's afraid of! Over the summer, her show Life of Kylie, has really taught us a lot about the makeup mogul. In a clip from an episode from Season 1, Kylie and her BFF Jordyn Woods went to a zoo together. Too bad Ky learns that she's terrified of butterflies.\n\n\"I'm scared if one lands on me!\" the 20-year-old screamed as her friend laughed. Of course, the workers assured her that the butterflies are harmless, but she didn't care.\n\n\"Butterflies are just part of the secrets of Kylie,\" she said in a voiceover. \"It's kind of just ironic because I'm terrified, terrified of butterflies. All butterflies. This is how I think of them: cut the wings off and if you just look at their bodies, they're not that pretty. It's literally a bug.\"\n\nThe irony came from the fact that she and boyfriend Travis Scott have matching tatoos of those \"bugs.\" Kylie got a mini butterfly above her right ankle while Travis, 25, got the same exact ink on his left ankle.\n\nA post shared by c/s \u2234jon\u271eboy\u2234 p/v (@jonboytattoo) on Feb 4, 2018 at 3:54pm PST\n\nThis isn't the first time the couple has shown their love using the winged insect. Over the course of their ten-month romance, they have sent each other cryptic messages on social media using the butterfly emoji, most likely inspired by Travis' song, \"Butterfly Effect\".\n\n\"She caught the waves just thumbin' through my braids (alright)/ Heatin' up, baby, I'm just heatin' up (it's lit),\" he rapped in the NSFW hit. \"Need ya love, not a need it is a must/ Feelin' stuck, you know how to keep me up.\" And it looks like the song even inspired their baby's nursery room!\n\n(Photo Credit: YouTube)\n\nBack in June, Life & Style reported that Kylie and Travis may have made their relationship even more permanent by getting married in a super secret ceremony. \"Kylie and Travis tied the knot at her Calabasas mansion,\" a source revealed. \"It wasn't a big, glamorous affair like other Kardashian weddings, and only a few close friends were invited. But Kylie is crazy about Travis.\"\n\nThe insider continued, \"There were no official E! cameras there, but Kylie asked her friends to film the special moment on their iPhones. She plans to use the footage on her new show.\"\n\nAs expected, her ex-boyfriend Tyga was not thrilled. \"Tyga will be upset,\" an insider said of the 27-year-old, who dated the lip kit mogul for almost three years. \"But he won't necessarily be surprised.

And I just thought it was funny, because I\u2019ve been so private before \u2014 and what do I really care if I was pregnant again?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get my period this month, so I was just really confused,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t stand to be on a flight for 10 hours not knowing.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kim Kardashian West Is Trying for a Third Baby \u2014 But Doctors Warn It\u2019s Not Safe\n\nExploring Other Options\n\nA few months later, in a November 2016 episode of KUWTK, Kardashian West broached the possibility of having someone else carry her third child.\n\nKardashian West then met with two fertility specialists, including Dr. Wong, who was on board with the option considering the medical risks of a third pregnancy for the star.\n\n\u201cUsing a surrogate is not an unreasonable option,\u201d he said. \u201cIf our goal is to grow your family like you want to, then a surrogate makes sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the two doctors that I trust have told me it wouldn\u2019t be safe for me to get pregnant again, I have to listen to that,\u201d said Kardashian West. \u201cBut because I don\u2019t know anyone that has been a surrogate or used one, I didn\u2019t really think about that as an option for me.\u201d\n\nKim Kardashian West/Instagram\n\nAt sister Kourtney Kardashian\u2018s suggestion, Kardashian west met with a woman named Natalie who had both carried a pregnancy herself and used a surrogate.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m more worried because I gave birth to two [children] \u2014 there\u2019s a sense in me that because I went through all that pain for these two babies and that I know we did this together \u2026 There\u2019s no one that would feel your love [like that],\u201d she said. \u201cThey are literally near your heart and inside of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy bond with my kids is so strong,\u201d she continued. \u201cI think my biggest fear if I had a surrogate is: Would I love them the same? That\u2019s the main thing I keep thinking about.\u201d\n\nNatalie reassured the star that the bond is just as strong, and Kardashian West sat down with momager Kris Jenner to discuss the news.\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that I can\u2019t carry another one,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to explore surrogacy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat scares me for you,\u201d said Jenner. \u201cWhat if she gives birth and then grabs the baby and makes a run for it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she can,\u201d said Kardashian West. \u201cAlso, the best thing is I could have a new baby and have no one know and live my life for a good year before we announce it.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Katherine Heigl Reveals the Emotional Way She Told Her Daughters She Was Pregnant\n\nBaby Fever Hits Hard\n\nIn an April episode of the most recent season of KUWTK, the reality star revealed that she and West, 40, are trying to conceive again despite their challenging pregnancies.\n\n\u201cI want my kids to have siblings, but the doctors don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s safe for me,\u201d she said, telling sister Kourtney and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian that she\u2019s \u201cgoing to try to have one more baby.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019d love nothing more than to expand my family and just know that I have this world at home that\u2019s safe,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd if for some reason I left this earth sooner than I really wanted to, then my kids would have a support system at home \u2014 so that I know that they would be okay if I wasn\u2019t here.\u201d\n\n\u201cKanye and I have always talked about having more kids,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut after what I went through in Paris, the urgency is even greater.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Kardashian West and her husband had been working hard on their relationship, having finally settled into a good place after enduring a period of marital strain sparked by her Paris robbery last October, followed swiftly by the rapper\u2019s hospitalized for exhaustion in November.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows she had major medical complications during her other two pregnancies,\u201d a source told PEOPLE. \u201cBut whenever things are going great with Kanye, Kim talks about having another baby.\u201d (The insider also acknowledged that a third baby would be \u201ca great storyline for the show.\u201d)\n\nSource: Kim Kardashian Instagram\n\nGetting Serious About Surrogacy\n\nIn the same April KUWTK episode, Kardashian West underwent a procedure in an attempt to help her become able to carry another child \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t successful.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t carry anymore kids \u2026 it\u2019s the worst,\u201d she confessed. \u201cI give up.\u201d\n\nAs a result, the star decided it was time to revisit the option of hiring a surrogate.\n\n\u201cKanye was really nervous about the surgery \u2026 but I know he would want to have more kids,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like surrogacy is the only option for me. Kanye and I are going to look into other options and see what we are comfortable with \u2026 but I\u2019m definitely leaning towards [surrogacy].\u201d\n\n\u201cI always knew surrogacy was an option \u2014 now it\u2019s my reality,\u201d she eventually concluded. \u201cWhatever is meant to be will be.\u201d\n\nA Plan in Motion\n\nIn June 2017, a source confirmed to PEOPLE that the stars had hired a surrogate. TMZ was the first to report the news.\n\nIt\u2019s a Girl!\n\nThe soon-to-be mother of three told host Ellen DeGeneres that her 4-year-old daughter North had taken to calling the unborn child, \u201cBaby Sister\u201d during an October 2017 appearance on the talk show. \u201cMy daughter thinks she\u2019s tricky,\u201d Kardashian West said. \u201cWe had a baby shower over the weekend, and I thought, \u2018You know, I really do want to have a baby shower because I want [North] to feel that something\u2019s coming and for her to really understand it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nA New Experience\n\nWhile she was excited to share the news with the rest of the Kardashian crew, Kardashian West admitted the situation felt different than when she was pregnant the first two times. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of weird when it\u2019s not you, so I don\u2019t know whether I should start eating donuts and celebrate like I would like old times or just go to the gym,\u201d Kardashian West told sister Kourtney on a December 2017 episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians. \u201cI\u2019m totally gonna forget and then a month before I\u2019m gonna be like holly sh\u2014, we need to get a nursery.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s Here!\n\nThe couple\u2019s second daughter has arrived via surrogate, Kardashian West shared via her website on January 16, 2018. The baby girl was born Jan. 15, at 12:47 a.m., weighing 7 lbs., 6 oz. \u201cKanye and I are happy to announce the arrival of our healthy, beautiful baby girl,\u201d she wrote in a post titled \u2018She\u2019s Here!\u2019.\n\n\u201cWe are incredibly grateful to our surrogate who made our dreams come true with the greatest gift one could give and to our wonderful doctors and nurses for their special care.\u201d"}

That was also the last time she won a Grand Slam, though she came close earlier this year when she played in the Australian Open finals.\n\nMuguruza has also won a Grand Slam title, but just one \u2014 taking home the win on the clay of Roland Garros, the French Open.

{"label": false, "txt": "The line-up for Victoria\u2019s Secret annual fashion show has been announced. While Gigi and Bella Hadid return to the stage, VS has cut off Kendall Jenner\u2019s wings.\n\nThe fashion world is gearing up for the biggest fashion event of the year \u2013 Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show. The lingerie brand have shortlisted the models who will walk the ramp this year and have handed out their wings. While model-sisters Gigi and Bella Hadid have reclaimed their wings and are preparing to return to the stage, the organisers have dropped Kendall Jenner from this year\u2019s line up.\n\nThe 21-year-old, who has been a part of the prestigious fashion event for two years now, will not return this year and the news has left the Kardashian family member disappointed. Reports suggest that Jenner is so mad with the brand that she is going about dissing and name-calling them.\n\nA website named News Punch claimed that Jenner was overheard telling friends that she was not added to this year\u2019s show because she told the brand\u2019s bosses that she doesn\u2019t worship Satan, indirectly hinting them as illuminati.\n\nThe website in question also quotes the model saying that Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2019s models are \u201cIlluminati prostitutes\u201d who are \u201cdegraded on a daily basis by the worst kind of guys \u2013 followers of Satan.\u201d\n\nApparently Jenner added, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t believe what these girls are forced to go through. They tried to lure me into the cult but I had to take a step back to hold onto my soul. [Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2019s models have] made a pact with Satan to get where they are. These girls have really bad mental health issues. They are beaten and sexually tortured, and regularly drugged so that they fall unconscious and their owners can do what they like with them.\u201d\n\nWhile these statements are shocking, Gossip Cop\u2019s sources claim that they aren\u2019t true. The website also reveals that Jenner\u2019s absence from 2017 Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show is due to a deal she signed with lingerie giant La Perla.\n\nThough fans of the famous brand will feel Jenner\u2019s absence, they have a lot more to look forward to. This year\u2019s line up features not only the Hadid sisters, Supermodels Lily Aldridge, Alessandra Ambrosio, Taylor Hill, Elsa Hosk, Martha Hunt, Adriana Lima, Stella Maxwell, Behati Prinsloo, Lais Ribeiro, Sara Sampaio, Josephine Skriver, Romee Strijd, Candice Swanepoel and Jasmine Tookes will flaunt their wings on the ramp.\n\nThe fashion show will take place in Shanghai this year on November 28.

{"label": false, "txt": "The rumour: Meghan Markle had a secret first husband\n\nWhere you heard it: The National Enquirer\n\nThe report: Markle\u2019s status as divorc\u00e9e has never been in dispute, but according to a new \u201cbombshell\u201d Enquirer cover story (is there any other kind?), Prince Harry will be the ex-actress\u2019s third kick at the matrimonial can. \u201cHow she HID PAST from Husband No. 2!\u201d claims one scandalous cover line, referring to \u201cMan-eater Meghan\u2019s\u201d ex Trevor Engelson. Inside, an unnamed source explains how Harry was \u201cblindsided\u201d by the news, which has been kept secret until now (per the NE), thanks to a \u201chush-hush annulment.\u201d\n\nSubscribe To Our Newsletters \u2014 And Get All Our Royal Coverage Straight To Your Inbox\n\nThe smell test: For the love of Liverpool \u2014 this stinks worse than the royal stables after derby day! Just for starters, if Meghan had been married before she married Trevor Engelson in 2011, why would she have felt the need to hide it? Back then she was a Hollywood actress, existing in a world where divorce is no biggie. It\u2019s not like she could have been planning for her royal future (yes, MM may be calculated, but she\u2019s not clairvoyant). And even if we run with this idea of a secret ex-hubby (whom The Enquirer never names, btw), wouldn\u2019t we already know about him? For his recent book Meghan Markle: A Hollywood Princess, royal biographer Andrew Morton spoke to dozens of people who knew Markle long before she was one half of a commemorative plate design. So we\u2019re supposed to believe that not one of them would have mentioned old what\u2019s-his-name? Never mind the fact that even \u201chush-hush annulments\u201d are a matter of public record. The Enquirer\u2019s insider speculates that MI-5 (a.k.a. her Majesty\u2019s Secret Service) probably \u201cscrubbed the records\u201d to conceal Markle\u2019s past, which is totally something that MI-5 would try to do. Except that unless they have a time machine, this is a story with way too many loose ends. In summation: Either Meghan Markle does not have a secret first husband (smart money), or she does, and anyone who knows about it better sleep with one eye open.\n\nThe rumour: The Palace is freaking out about the steamy love scenes in the upcoming Meghan and Harry Lifetime movie\n\nWhere you heard it: Vanity Fair\n\nThe report: In case you are not already counting down the days, Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance is the upcoming Lifetime movie that depicts the couple\u2019s courtship, including (per this preview), some between-the-sheets time, and one scene-stealing giraffe. It\u2019s that first part that purportedly has the palace press office in a tizzy. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve heard is that they\u2019re seriously worried about the sex scene,\u201d the movie\u2019s director, Menhaj Huda, told VF last week, adding that his info is on good authority, as his \u201cwife\u2019s best friend has been dating the palace press secretary.\u201d\n\nThe smell test: What really reeks here is Huda\u2019s indiscretion. Whatever insider info he did or did not receive via his wife\u2019s connection, you can be sure he won\u2019t be hearing anything else in the future. (Jeez, dude \u2014 it\u2019s called protecting your source.) Is the palace \u201cseriously worried\u201d about this movie? It\u2019s easy to see why Huda would want us to think that, since scandal sells. In truth, it\u2019s probably a matter of relativity. Because sure, they\u2019d probably prefer that a factually based account of Harry and Meghan\u2019s premarital sex-fest wasn\u2019t coming soon to a TV near you, but it\u2019s not like it\u2019s a documentary. On the scale of royal scandal \u2014 a 1 being Kate Middleton\u2019s cork wedges and a 10 being Prince Charles\u2019s tampon ambitions \u2014 this is a 2.\n\nThe rumour: Meghan\u2019s mom Doria will tell all in an interview with Oprah\n\nWhere you heard it: The Mirror\n\nThe report: Last week, The Daily Mail reported that Markle\u2019s mom visited Winfrey\u2019s Santa Barbara Estate, where she stayed for six hours, and exited with gifts (presumably a bunch of the Big O\u2019s favourite things). At the time, the reason for the visit was unknown, but now The Mirror is quoting an unnamed \u201cUS TV source,\u201d who claims that the pair were brainstorming ideas for a TV appearance (well, duh). Apparently both women are keen to discuss the reaction to Meghan and Harry through the lens of racism: \u201cIt\u2019s an issue close to both Oprah and Doria,\u201d quoth The Mirror\u2019s source, adding that the only thing needed now is a green light from Buckingham Palace.\n\nRumour Has It That Meghan Markle And Kate Middleton \u2018Hate Each Other\u2019s Guts.\u2019 Is That Really The Case?\n\nThe smell test: Not to nitpick here, but can an interview really be a \u201ctell-all\u201d if the palace has to approve it? Historically, the royal family has espoused more of a \u201ctell-none\u201d approach to the media. Oprah (who has interviewed pretty much everyone on the planet) never sat down with Diana or Charles or Queen Lizzie herself. That said, Markle is at the forefront of a whole new era, particularly when it comes to royals and the public. Both Harry and Wills have done interviews recently, discussing personal details about their own mental health, and clearly the Queen approved those. Given that Doria has thus far kept her mouth shut (unlike many members of the Markle clan who have made a full-time job of trashing their world-famous relation in the press), it\u2019s possible a (highly scripted) sit-down with Winfrey will be her well-earned reward.\n\nThe rumour: Prince Harry will wear a wedding ring\n\nWhere you heard it: E! News\n\nThe report: This will-he-or-won\u2019t-he drama has been ongoing since the engagement announcement, but now a source is telling E! that the Royal Ginger Snap \u201cdoes want to wear a wedding band.\u201d Improbably, this is one matter that is not covered in the royal etiquette handbook, and is instead a matter of personal preference: The Queen\u2019s husband Prince Philip does not wear a ring (no big surprise there), and neither does William, while is father, Prince Charles, does.\n\nThe smell test: The idea that there is no existing protocol on the subject of male finger bling is hard to fathom, but if that\u2019s the case, this all smells pretty sound. E! has proven to have some pretty well-placed royal sources. Meghan\u2019s feminism could mean that she believes rings are for both genders. And Harry is definitely more a jewellery guy than super-traditional Wills. If royal memory serves, he and Meghan wore matching bracelets even before they went public as a couple."}

The 29-year-old star has been making headlines as she and her much younger boyfriend, 18-year-old rapper YBN Almighty Jay, continue to step out together, but according to a new report by MTO News that was further confirmed by Page Six on April 30, Chyna is nearly three months pregnant with his baby.\n\nChyna sparked the pregnancy rumors when she and Jay were spotted at LAX on April 28, where fans thought she was sporting a bit of a bump, which she tried to cover up with a baggy sweatshirt. According to the report, Chyna flashed a smile at the paparazzi and even rubbed her stomach. In a recent interview, Jay admitted he wasn't wearing condoms, and that he wouldn't mind if Chyna got pregnant. \"I don\u2019t wear condoms,\" he said. \"I would not want to f\u2013k a bitch I did not want to get pregnant.

She shares 16-month-old daughter Dream with her ex Rob Kardashian, and she also shares a five-year-old son named King with her ex, Tyga. Even though it seems like Chyna really enjoys motherhood, her co-parenting relationship with her exes aren't going as smooth. Rob and Chy may start battling it out soon for custody of Dream after Chyna was involved in a violent incident at an amusement park earlier this month. TMZ also stated that Rob doesn't want Chyna introducing Dream to all of the men that she dates unless she becomes involved in a long-term romance.\n\nChyna and Jay may have only been dating since February, but things seemed to have turned serious quickly. Just a few weeks ago, Jay posted an Instagram of Chyna with the caption, \"Will You Marry Me?\" It looks like Jay was just professing his love for his girlfriend, as Chyna hasn't been seen wearing a ring, and she's been staying silent on both the engagement and pregnancy rumors \u2014 though the speculation is only growing, as fans have started posting comments on her Instagram claiming that they see a baby bump.\n\nA post shared by Blac Chyna (@blacchyna) on Apr 28, 2018 at 1:37am PDT\n\nOn one of her most recent photos, one fan wrote, \"I love the outfit, but... Chyna looks pregnant in this picture... I see her glow... I tried to hold it in and I can't,\" while another simply exclaimed, \"I see a bump!!!

{"label": false, "txt": "Powered by imdb\n\nAn actor and producer known as much for his versatility as he is for his handsome face, Golden Globe-winner Brad Pitt's most widely recognized role may be Tyler Durden in Fight Club (1999). However, his portrayals of Billy Beane in Moneyball (2011), and Rusty Ryan in the remake of Ocean's Eleven (2001) and its sequels, also loom large in his filmography. Pitt was born William Bradley Pitt on December 18th, 1963, in Shawnee, Oklahoma, and was raised in Springfield, Missouri. He is the son of Jane Etta (Hillhouse), a school counselor, and William Alvin Pitt, a truck company manager. He has a younger brother, Douglas (Doug) Pitt, and a younger sister, Julie Neal Pitt. At Kickapoo High School, Pitt was involved in sports, debating, student government and school musicals. Pitt attended the University of Missouri, where he majored in journalism with a focus on advertising. He occasionally acted in fraternity shows. He left college two credits short of graduating to move to California. Before he became successful at acting, Pitt supported himself by driving strippers in limos, moving refrigerators and dressing as a giant chicken while working for \"el Pollo Loco\". Pitt's earliest credited roles were in television, starting on the daytime soap opera Another World (1964) before appearing in the recurring role of Randy on the legendary prime time soap opera Dallas (1978). Following a string of guest appearances on various television series through the 1980s, Pitt gained widespread attention with a small part in Thelma & Louise (1991), in which he played a sexy criminal who romanced and conned Geena Davis. This lead to starring roles in badly received films such as Johnny Suede (1991) and Cool World (1992). But Pitt's career hit an upswing with his casting in A River Runs Through It (1992), which cemented his status as an multi-layered actor as opposed to just a pretty face. Pitt's subsequent projects were as quirky and varied in tone as his performances, ranging from his unforgettably comic cameo as stoner roommate Floyd in True Romance (1993) to romantic roles in such visually lavish films as Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles (1994) and Legends of the Fall (1994), to an emotionally tortured detective in the horror-thriller Se7en (1995). His portrayal of frenetic oddball Jeffrey Goines in Twelve Monkeys (1995) won him a Globe for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role. Pitt's portrayal of Achilles in the big-budget period drama Troy (2004) helped establish his appeal as action star and was closely followed by a co-starring role in the stylish spy-versus-spy flick Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005). It was on the set of Mr. & Mrs. Smith that Pitt, who married Jennifer Aniston in a highly publicized ceremony in 2000, met his current partner Angelina Jolie. Pitt left Aniston for Jolie in 2005, a break-up that continues to fuel tabloid stories years after its occurrence. He continues to wildly vary his film choices, appearing in everything from high-concept popcorn flicks such as Megamind (2010) to adventurous critic-bait like Inglourious Basterds (2009) and The Tree of Life (2011). He has received two Best Actor Oscar nominations, for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008) and Moneyball (2011). In 2014, he starred in the war film Fury (2014), opposite Shia LaBeouf, Logan Lerman, Jon Bernthal, and Michael Pe\u00f1a. Pitt and Jolie have six children, including two sons and a daughter who were adopted. See full bio on IMDb \u00bb"}

Jolie turned in the same salary for three years in a row for Salt to Forbes.when that was the only film she'd done in that time period. Her estimated salaries were always inflated also by Jolie and her loonies to try to keep her on top of the pay scale in some insane competition with every other actress in Hollywood. Other films that she did, those Oscar bait indies, barely made back their production and promotion. That film with Damon, the one that Eastwood directed. Salt was a disappointment, as was The Tourist and Disney said they were disappointed in Maleficent. One does not keep getting top salary for disappointments despite what Jolie lied about to Forbes during the last twelve years. One also does not keep getting top value either when chasing the paparazzi route for income. Those deals (her own private pap) smelled of desperation and brought down the price too. Jolie finally had to open her own fan site to post those exclusive pictures that no one else would pay for on their celeb gossip sitesall to keep the few remaining old loonies happy.Despite Jolie's declarations of income and the loonies posting those exaggerations all over the net, Hollywood is a Business. They want to make money for Themselves, and if the product isn't breaking even time and again, the stars are not gifted with large salaries in the amounts making more than the studios."}

It\u2019s been rumored for weeks that the 41-year-old had plans to purchase Cecil B.

The amount was reportedly accepted by the owner and is currently in escrow.\n\nCecil\u2019s home, which he lived in until his death in 1959, is considered one of the greatest properties in L.A., and Angie will have some famous neighbors, including Casey Affleck, Natalie Portman and Ellen Pompeo. There\u2019s tons of space for the six kids, too \u2014 the house boasts 6 bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, plus a spacious backyard.\n\nThis huge purchase comes following rumors that Angie planned on moving her kids to London so she could work there after her September 2016 split from Brad Pitt, 53.

{"label": false, "txt": "When Jennifer Aniston opens the door to the Malibu bungalow she\u2019s been holed up in lately, she gives me a radiant smile and an effusive hello. Then she bursts into tears. We have scarcely sat down in the living room, a serene little haven simply furnished with cushy white sofas and white flowers and white candles, when her face crumples. She is instantly aghast. \u201cI haven\u2019t been feeling emotional lately, really I haven\u2019t,\u201d she wails, fluttering her hands like Rachel Green in distress, except that this time it isn\u2019t funny. Other than the 24-hour security detail guarding her safety, Aniston is all alone in the modest rental where she has camped out while dealing with the end of her marriage to Brad Pitt\u2014and its devastating aftermath, which has been far worse than the actual split. The last few months have brought an endless nightmare of hurtful headlines about her soon-to-be-ex-husband, along with blatantly fraudulent stories about herself, in the tabloids and supermarket gossip magazines. Pursued around the clock by the rabid paparazzi she refers to as \u201cratzies,\u201d she is ambushed even on her own deck by photographers who lurk on the beach outside her door, spying on her every move. As she squeezes her eyes shut in an effort to stop crying, the scene provides a painful contrast with the last time we met. Little more than a year ago, I interviewed Pitt at the Beverly Hills mansion that he and Aniston had just spent two years renovating. A testament to both his passion for architecture and the couple\u2019s hopeful vision of their shared future, the beautiful old house awaited only a baby in a bassinet to complete a picture-perfect existence. When I left, they both walked me out to my car. Their home, its windows lit and welcoming, glowed in the twilight. As we said our good-byes, Pitt and Aniston leaned together in the driveway, arms twined around each other. Her head rested trustingly on his buff chest, still pumped up from his rigorous training to play the warrior Achilles in Troy. They seemed the most fortunate couple imaginable\u2014two beautiful superstars who had hit the jackpot, earning not only fame and riches but also an enduring love. Their fans had long been captivated by the romance of America\u2019s Sweetheart and the Sexiest Man in the World, and now they were ready to begin a thrilling new chapter. Aniston\u2019s 10-year run on Friends was ending, and she and Pitt had vowed to start a family when her stupendously successful television series was finished. Pitt\u2019s final words to me reinforced the impression of connubial bliss: \u201cI\u2019m happier than I\u2019ve ever been.\u201d But the ensuing months brought an onslaught of rumors that he had gotten involved with Angelina Jolie while filming Mr. & Mrs. Smith. Instead of the joyful announcement many had anticipated from the Pitts, there was only silence. The New Year began with photographs of the beautiful couple strolling hand in hand along the beach on Anguilla, looking relaxed and happy. Immediately the buzz shifted into rhapsodic re-appraisals of the state of their union. And then came the oh-so-civilized announcement, on January 7, that Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt were separating\u2014that their parting was \u201cthe result of much thoughtful consideration,\u201d that it was not caused by \u201cany of the speculation reported by the tabloid media,\u201d and that they would remain \u201ccommitted and caring friends with great love and admiration for one another.\u201d If Pitt had kept a low profile in the months to come, that might even have turned out to be true. Instead, the ominous drumroll of gossip began to crescendo as he and Jolie rendezvoused in exotic locales, still denying that they were an item. With the paparazzi snapping away, Pitt stepped into what looked suspiciously like a paternal role with Jolie\u2019s adopted Cambodian son, Maddox. \u201cIt was extremely hurtful to Jen that he was seen with another woman so quickly after they were separated,\u201d says Andrea Bendewald, an actress who has been one of Aniston\u2019s closest friends since they were teenagers. Instead of being reviled as The Other Woman, Jolie posed for pictures on an energetic round of appearances as a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations\u2014and then trumped even that public-relations bonanza by adopting another orphan, an African girl whose parents had died of AIDS. In the blink of an eye, the twice-divorced Jolie\u2014previously known as a tattooed vixen with a taste for bisexuality, heroin, brotherly incest, mental institutions, and wearing her husbands\u2019 blood\u2014had morphed into a globe-trotting humanitarian who seemed to be channeling Audrey Hepburn. For the 36-year-old Aniston, who had expected to spend the past year being pregnant, the pain of watching this spectacle unfold was compounded by vicious rumors about herself. As misogynist as they were false, sensationalistic stories claimed the real reason the marriage ended was that Aniston refused to have Pitt\u2019s baby because she was so ambitious she cared only about her career. Even now, that sexist slur makes her face darken. \u201cA man divorcing would never be accused of choosing career over children,\u201d she says. \u201cThat really pissed me off. I\u2019ve never in my life said I didn\u2019t want to have children. I did and I do and I will! The women that inspire me are the ones who have careers and children; why would I want to limit myself? I\u2019ve always wanted to have children, and I would never give up that experience for a career. I want to have it all.\u201d Aniston\u2019s intimates note acidly that Pitt could have done more to refute the mean-spirited rumor that his wife wouldn\u2019t bear his child, which reinforced the impression that he had good cause to leave her for Earth Mother Jolie. To some, this looks like sheer hypocrisy. \u201cWhen Brad and Jen were in the marriage, having a baby was not his priority\u2014ever,\u201d says one mutual friend. \u201cIt was an abstract desire for him, whereas for Jen it was much more immediate. So is there a part of Brad that\u2019s diabolical? Did he think, I need to get out of this marriage, but I want to come out smelling like a rose, so I\u2019m going to let Jen be cast as the ultra-feminist and I\u2019m going to get cast as the poor husband who couldn\u2019t get a baby and so had to move on?\u201d As the image wars raged in the gossip media, a heartbroken Aniston retreated to her Malibu hideaway to lick her wounds in private, accompanied only by her elderly corgi-terrier mix, Norman, who spends most of his time snoring on his dog bed. Public sympathy seemed to be on her side; the Hollywood boutique Kitson reported that its \u201cTeam Aniston\u201d T-shirts were outselling \u201cTeam Jolie\u201d T-shirts by a margin of 25 to 1. But that was cold comfort as Aniston was assaulted by one provocation after another. When the Pitts split up, Brad insisted he hadn\u2019t slept with Jolie, and Aniston accepted his denial. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t na\u00efve,\u201d says Kristin Hahn, an executive at the Pitts\u2019 production company, Plan B. \u201cShe\u2019s not suggesting she didn\u2019t know there was an enchantment, and a friendship. But Brad was saying, \u2018This is not about another woman.\u2019\u201d The moment he and Aniston separated, however, he re-emerged in what looked like a full-blown affair with Jolie. Struggling to accept a separation she never wanted, Aniston found that the \u201cfacts\u201d she had been told kept shifting like quicksand beneath her feet. When I ask about that gracious, no-one-is-to-blame announcement of their separation, she takes a deep breath. \u201cWhat we said was true\u2014\u201d As I raise my eyebrows, she pauses for a moment, and then adds carefully, \u201c\u2014as far as I knew. We wrote it together, very consciously, and felt very good about it. We exited this relationship as beautifully as we entered it.\u201d All Aniston wanted then was to figure out what happened; how did the happy life they\u2019d planned drift so far off course? But everything changed on April 29, when photographs broke of Brad and Angelina frolicking on the beach with Maddox at a romantic resort in Africa. \u201cThe world was shocked, and I was shocked,\u201d she says, still bending over backward not to excoriate her ex. But to say that this news was like pouring salt in the wound would understate its impact considerably; how about pouring molten lava into the hole where somebody ripped your heart out? And then things got worse.\n\nThe skies over Los Angeles are uncharacteristically gray today, and the Pacific shimmers with an opalescent sheen. Although the weather is gloomy, the ocean is calm; waves lap gently at the shoreline, making a soft shushing sound that Aniston has found very soothing lately. \u201cThat\u2019s quite a backyard, in my opinion,\u201d she says as we stand on her deck, watching the hypnotic rhythm of the waves. \u201cJust being able to go to the water\u2019s edge and scream\u2014\u201d Photographed by Mario Testino for the September 2005 issue. She grins. \u201cNot too loudly. You don\u2019t want people to think that you\u2019re crazy. But it can be very cathartic.\u201d She is wearing a white tank top and white drawstring linen pants, with a vivid lavender cashmere cardiwrap around her to ward off the unseasonable chill. Formidably toned by yoga, her body is in superb shape, but despite her tanned skin and megawatt smile she looks fragile and wan. She remains resolutely upbeat nonetheless, casting her current situation in the most positive light possible. \u201cIt\u2019s beautiful here; I love it,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to have a little Malibu beach house, and it feels good. I\u2019m enjoying simplifying things.\u201d Although the bungalow was dark and depressing when she first saw it, a quickie makeover has transformed it into a cozy sanctuary that\u2019s far more representative of Aniston\u2019s personal taste than the showplace she and Pitt shared, where the d\u00e9cor seemed all hard edges and unforgiving materials. \u201cBrad and I used to joke that every piece of furniture was either a museum piece or just uncomfortable,\u201d Aniston says. \u201cHe definitely had his sense of style, and I definitely have my sense of style, and sometimes they clashed. I wasn\u2019t so much into modern.\u201d I mention Nicole Kidman\u2019s quip after splitting up with Tom Cruise, when she was asked what she looked forward to in her new life without the diminutive husband who had abruptly ended their marriage. \u201cWearing high heels again,\u201d Kidman retorted. So I ask Aniston\u2014who filed for divorce on March 25 and expects it to become final this fall\u2014what she\u2019s enjoying about being on her own. \u201cI can have a comfortable couch,\u201d she says with a wry smile.\n\nIn the tabloids and celebrity gossip magazines, the soap-opera version of her life continues to hurtle along like a runaway express train, rushing Aniston through major life stages with ludicrous speed: Jen Is Devastated! Jen Is Furious! Jen Gets Revenge! Jen Has a New Man! Jen Is Over Brad! Most of the stories are wrong. (No, Oprah didn\u2019t try to get Brad and Jen back together; no, Jen is not romantically involved with Vince Vaughn, her co-star in The Break-Up, a comedy about a separating couple who continue to live together, which they shot in Chicago over the summer.) Other reports are just idiotically simpleminded, breathlessly advancing a plot that bears little resemblance to the long, complex, painful experience of getting over a divorce. While the tabloids insist on dividing Aniston\u2019s emotions into neat, distinct chapters, the reality is that pain and denial and anger and resignation all blur together, sometimes at the same moment\u2014and the lengthy process of mourning is nowhere near over. \u201cThere are many stages of grief,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s sad, something coming to an end. It cracks you open, in a way\u2014cracks you open to feeling. When you try to avoid the pain, it creates greater pain. I\u2019m a human being, having a human experience in front of the world. I wish it weren\u2019t in front of the world. I try really hard to rise above it.\u201d Aniston is struggling to find a deeper meaning in the debacle. \u201cI have to think there\u2019s some reason I have called this into my life,\u201d she says. \u201cI have to believe that\u2014otherwise it\u2019s just cruel.\u201d Her friends are filled with admiration for the way she\u2019s handled the whole mess. \u201cThis woman is basically having a root canal without anesthesia, but she\u2019s really trying not to numb the pain or shove it under the rug,\u201d says Hahn. \u201cShe\u2019s grown so much, and she continues to grow on a daily basis, because every time you think, \u2018Well, I\u2019ve dealt with this,\u2019 there\u2019s another hurdle to get over. It\u2019s a bit Job-like at the moment.\u201d Photographed by Mario Testino for the September 2005 issue.\n\nAniston\u2019s response has been to retreat into her cocoon, \u201cin an effort to take care of myself and my heart,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m nesting. I love being home. I have friends that come over. My girlfriends I\u2019ve had for 20 years. When things happen, the tribe gathers around and lifts you up. I\u2019ve had lonely moments, sure, but I\u2019m also enjoying being alone. There\u2019s no question it takes getting used to; I\u2019m a partnership person, and if something happens your instinct is to share it\u2014but you\u2019re no longer part of a couple. I definitely miss that. It\u2019s sort of like Bambi\u2014like you\u2019re trying to learn how to walk. You\u2019re a little awkward; you stumble a little bit. The things you would do with your partner, you don\u2019t do. It\u2019s uncharted territory, but I think it\u2019s good for me to be a solo person right now. You\u2019re forced to re-discover yourself and take it to another level. If you can find a way to see the glass half full, these are the moments when you learn the most. I\u2019ve had to re-introduce myself to myself in a way that\u2019s different.\u201d She doesn\u2019t downplay the difficulties. \u201cAm I lonely? Yes. Am I upset? Yes. Am I confused? Yes. Do I have my days when I\u2019ve thrown a little pity party for myself? Absolutely. But I\u2019m also doing really well,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve got an unbelievable support team, and I\u2019m a tough cookie.\u2026 I believe in therapy; I think it\u2019s an incredible tool in educating the self on the self. I feel very strong. I\u2019m really proud of how I\u2019ve conducted myself.\u201d A crucial part of Aniston\u2019s strategy has been to ignore the putrid stew of rumor, speculation, and outright falsehood in the tabloid media. \u201cIt\u2019s been very important for me not to read anything, not to see anything,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been my saving grace. That stuff is just toxic for me right now. I probably avoided a lot of suffering by not engaging in it, not reading, not watching.\u201d She gestures toward Norman, who has roused himself for a moment to check on his mistress\u2019s whereabouts. \u201cIt\u2019s like those dog cones,\u201d she says, encircling her neck as if putting on one of the plastic cones prescribed by vets to prevent dogs from scratching their ears. \u201cI have my imaginary dog cone on, so I don\u2019t see anything. It just allows for a much more peaceful life.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, as Pitt publicly flaunted the instant family he had created with Jolie, the tableaux of their newfound togetherness were humiliating. \u201cI would be a robot if I said I didn\u2019t feel moments of anger, of hurt, of embarrassment,\u201d Aniston acknowledges. But she tries to keep the lurid details to herself. \u201cShe is grieving, but she\u2019s taken the high road,\u201d says Bendewald. \u201cShe\u2019s mourning the death of a marriage, and she\u2019s done it very privately. She can have her moments of rage, but she doesn\u2019t want to out him, and that keeps her heart clear. She\u2019s not bad-mouthing him. She doesn\u2019t want to make him the villain and her the victim.\u201d Indeed, Aniston vehemently rejects the interpretation that she was left for another woman. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like a victim,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with this therapist for a long time, and her major focus is that you get one day of being a victim\u2014and that\u2019s it. Then we take responsibility for our own input. To live in a victim place is pointing a finger at someone else, as if you have no control. Relationships are two people; everyone is accountable. A lot goes into a relationship coming together, and a lot goes into a relationship falling apart. She\u2019d say, \u2018Even if it\u2019s 98 percent the other person\u2019s fault, it\u2019s 2 percent yours, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to focus on.\u2019 You can only clean up your side of the street.\u201d These days, one index of recovery is the fact that Aniston\u2019s sardonic humor is resurfacing. When I tell her that my 13-year-old son is a big fan of hers, she doesn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cIs he single?\u201d she asks, deadpan. She\u2019ll toss off a crack about Pitt\u2019s startling transformation into a punky bleached blond. \u201cBilly Idol called\u2014he wants his look back,\u201d she murmurs with a sly smile. By now she can even talk about those gut-wrenching photos of Jolie and Pitt in Kenya with mordant resignation rather than tears. \u201cI can\u2019t say it was one of the highlights of my year,\u201d she says. \u201cWho would deal with that and say, \u2018Isn\u2019t that sweet! That looks like fun!\u2019? But shit happens. You joke and say, \u2018What doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger.\u2019\u201d She sighs. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve earned a superpower shield,\u201d she says. Then, afraid of sounding grandiose, she adds, \u201cI\u2019m not comparing my suffering to other people\u2019s suffering. Everybody has their own.\u201d\n\nAniston\u2019s friends were particularly horrified by W magazine\u2019s 60-page photo spread featuring Pitt and Jolie as an early-1960s-style married couple with a brood of miniature blond Brads. \u201cYou want to shake the shit out of him and say, \u2018Your timing sucks!\u2019\u201d says one. \u201cHe\u2019s made some choices that have been tremendously insensitive.\u201d The W feature, which was entitled \u201cDomestic Bliss,\u201d couldn\u2019t be blamed on the paparazzi; not only did Pitt conceptualize it, but he retained the international rights, so he actually profited from it. Aniston\u2019s eyes widen in surprise when I mention that last fact, and she grimaces. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that,\u201d she says. But she refuses to indulge herself in an angry reaction. \u201cIs it odd timing? Yeah. But it\u2019s not my life,\u201d she says. \u201cHe makes his choices. He can do\u2014whatever. We\u2019re divorced, and you can see why.\u201d She shakes her head in exasperation. \u201cI can also imagine Brad having absolutely no clue why people would be appalled by it,\u201d she adds. \u201cBrad is not mean-spirited; he would never intentionally try to rub something in my face. In hindsight, I can see him going, \u2018Oh\u2014I can see that that was inconsiderate.\u2019 But I know Brad. Brad would say, \u2018That\u2019s art!\u2019\u201d She rolls her eyes, pretending to screw something into her forehead. \u201cThere\u2019s a sensitivity chip that\u2019s missing,\u201d she says. Aniston\u2019s friends are amazed at her willingness to give Pitt the benefit of the doubt, but they basically agree with her assessment. \u201cI don\u2019t think he was trying to hurt Jen,\u201d says Courteney Cox, Aniston\u2019s dear friend and former co-star on Friends. \u201cI don\u2019t think that Brad is malicious, or a liar. The W thing was his idea, but I don\u2019t think he thought that one through, about what it would look like to anyone else.\u201d Although Aniston remains determined not to lash out, she sometimes questions her own restraint. \u201cWhy am I protecting him?\u201d she exclaimed to one friend, only to continue with what she sees as the dignified course of action. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in taking public potshots,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt\u2019s not my concern anymore. What happened to him after the separation\u2014it\u2019s his life now. I\u2019ve made a conscious effort not to add to the toxicity of this situation. I haven\u2019t retaliated. I don\u2019t want to be a part of it. I don\u2019t have a halo that I\u2019m polishing here; everyone has their personal thoughts. But I would much rather everyone move on. I am not defined by this relationship. I am not defined by the part they\u2019re making me play in the triangle. It\u2019s maddening to me. But I had a mom who was very angry about her divorce, and made shots, and I don\u2019t want to play that out. If people are frustrated that I don\u2019t want to do that, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m figuring this out as I go along. This is my first time at this particular picnic.\u201d\n\nAs befits a storybook tale, the Pitts\u2019 marriage was the first for both of them, and some of Aniston\u2019s fondest memories are from the time they shared before the world discovered their romance. \u201cWe had so much fun falling in love,\u201d she says wistfully. \u201cIt was so private; we kept it to ourselves for so long. It was something we were really proud of.\u201d But after the relationship became public, it was always difficult to reconcile their mythic image with the quotidian reality of their private life, which was more likely to involve watching television, ordering takeout, and having close friends over than swanning around on red carpets. Photographed by Mario Testino for the September 2005 issue. \u201cWe were put on a pedestal, but we were just a couple like anybody else,\u201d Aniston says. \u201cWhen we were home, we\u2019d watch the shows we loved, and one time there was this program called It\u2019s Good to Be Brad and Jen. It was all about us going to Scotland and Greece and having our matching S.U.V.\u2019s, and it wasn\u2019t my life\u2014I\u2019d never even been to some of these places, but even I got sucked in. We\u2019re sitting there saying, \u2018Yeah, boy, it sure must be good to be Brad and Jen!\u2019 So is it our responsibility to demystify this, to say, \u2018This is not what it\u2019s like\u2014it\u2019s not that fabulous, not that great\u2019? There\u2019s no doubt our life is fortunate, but \u2026 \u201c But even golden couples struggle with the formidable challenges of marriage. \u201cIt\u2019s like the ebb and flow of every relationship,\u201d Aniston says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard; it gets easy; it gets fun again. What\u2019s hard to sustain is some ideal that it\u2019s perfect. That\u2019s ridiculous. What\u2019s fantastic about marriage is getting through those ebbs and flows with the same person, and looking across the room and saying, \u2018I\u2019m still here. And I still love you.\u2019 You re-meet, reconnect. You have marriages within marriages within marriages. That\u2019s what I love about marriage. That\u2019s what I want in marriage. It\u2019s unfortunate, but we live in a very disposable society. Those moments where it looks like \u2018Uh-oh, this isn\u2019t working!\u2019\u2014those are the most important, transformative moments. Most couples draw up divorce papers when they\u2019re missing out on an amazing moment of deepening and enlightenment and connection.\u201d She sighs heavily and turns away to light a Merit cigarette. \u201cThat\u2019s not Brad\u2019s view of it,\u201d she says, glum again. \u201cWe believe in different things, I guess. You can\u2019t force a relationship, even if it\u2019s your view of how you would like it to be conducted. Obviously two people leave a relationship because there\u2019s a different thought pattern happening. My goal is to try and achieve a very deep, committed relationship. That\u2019s what I\u2019m interested in, but it\u2019s someone\u2019s prerogative to be or not to be in or out of a relationship.\u201d \u201cI think Jen wanted to work it out, and I don\u2019t think he wanted to work it out,\u201d Andrea Bendewald observes. \u201cI don\u2019t think he knew what he wanted.\u201d Nevertheless, Aniston has only kind words about her marriage. \u201cI still feel so lucky to have experienced it. I wouldn\u2019t know what I know now if I hadn\u2019t been married to Brad,\u201d she says. \u201cI love Brad; I really love him. I will love him for the rest of my life. He\u2019s a fantastic man. I don\u2019t regret any of it, and I\u2019m not going to beat myself up about it. We spent seven very intense years together; we taught each other a lot\u2014about healing, and about fun. We helped each other through a lot, and I really value that. It was a beautiful, complicated relationship. The sad thing, for me, is the way it\u2019s been reduced to a Hollywood clich\u00e9\u2014or maybe it\u2019s just a human clich\u00e9. I have a lot of compassion for everyone going through this.\u201d\n\nAs for what went wrong, Aniston rejects any simplistic explanation. \u201cIt\u2019s just complicated,\u201d she says. \u201cRelationships are complicated, whether they\u2019re friendships or business relationships or parent relationships. I don\u2019t think anybody in a marriage gets to a point where they feel like \u2018We\u2019ve got it!\u2019 You\u2019re two people continually evolving, and there will be times when those changes clash. There are all these levels of growth\u2014and when you stop growing together, that\u2019s when the problems happen.\u201d Friends say that it was always difficult for Aniston and Pitt to maintain the intimacy they craved while juggling their demanding work schedules, which often required long separations. Those tensions notwithstanding, Aniston believed her marriage was the real thing. \u201cWe both did,\u201d she says. So what happened? \u201cI think\u2014it changed,\u201d she says haltingly. \u201cWe both changed.\u201d She sighs again. \u201cYou do the best you can, and I think we did. We did the best we could.\u201d Both of them? She looks me straight in the eye. \u201cBoth parties,\u201d she says. But nagging questions remain about Pitt\u2019s conduct during the months leading up to their separation. \u201cShe was committed to the marriage,\u201d says Bendewald. \u201cHe wanted to figure out who he was and what he wanted, but he seemed to want to do it without being married. She wanted him to figure out what he wanted and stay married. He didn\u2019t think he could do that, so at that point she was like, \u2018O.K., go figure it out.\u2019\u201d Throughout that period, Pitt insisted that his relationship with Jolie was not the cause of his marital discontent, but his actions since the separation have suggested otherwise. \u201cI just don\u2019t know what happened,\u201d Aniston admits. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot I don\u2019t understand, a lot I don\u2019t know, and probably never will know, really. So I choose to take away with me as much integrity and dignity and respect for what that relationship was as I can. I feel as if I\u2019m trying to scrounge around and pick up the pieces in the midst of this media circus.\u201d Does she buy Brad\u2019s claim that he didn\u2019t cheat on her before they separated? \u201cI choose to believe my husband,\u201d Aniston says. \u201cAt this point, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised by anything, but I would much rather choose to believe him.\u201d\n\nTheir friends are still trying to parse what happened with Jolie. \u201cI don\u2019t think he started an affair physically, but I think he was attracted to her,\u201d says Courteney Cox, who vacationed with her husband, David Arquette, and the Pitts on Anguilla just before they announced their separation. \u201cThere was a connection, and he was honest about that with Jen. Most of the time, when people are attracted to other people, they don\u2019t tell. At least he was honest about it. It was an attraction that he fought for a period of time.\u201d He may have been fighting it, but Pitt virtually checked out of his marriage as soon as he began working with Jolie, according to Aniston\u2019s intimates. \u201cHe was gone,\u201d says one. Aniston has met Jolie only once, when she took a passing opportunity to say hello. \u201cIt was on the lot of Friends\u2014I pulled over and introduced myself,\u201d Aniston recalls. \u201cI said, \u2018Brad is so excited about working with you. I hope you guys have a really good time.\u2019\u201d But he soon became emotionally unavailable to his wife, at a time when she needed him desperately. Pitt\u2019s withdrawal coincided with the end of Friends, which Aniston experienced as a huge loss. \u201cThat was really painful. It was a family, and I don\u2019t do great with families splitting up,\u201d says Aniston, who was deeply wounded by her parents\u2019 bitter divorce, which happened when she was 9. \u201cIt was hard to have such a wonderful constant in your life, a place to go every day, and then all of a sudden it\u2019s not there.\u201d When she reached out for her husband\u2019s support, she didn\u2019t get it. \u201cHe just wasn\u2019t there for me,\u201d she says. To the amazement of Aniston\u2019s friends, Pitt didn\u2019t even show up for the final taping of Friends. \u201cHe was working,\u201d she says, still defending him, even though movie stars have been known to request changes in a shooting schedule to accommodate events that are important to them.\n\nAlthough she isn\u2019t talking to Pitt these days, Aniston remains in regular contact with his mother, whom she loves dearly, and she doesn\u2019t rule out a better relationship with Brad in the future. \u201cI really do hope that someday we can be friends again,\u201d she says. She certainly doesn\u2019t regret her four-and-a-half-year marriage\u2014not even the million-dollar wedding with 50,000 flowers, a 40-member gospel choir, a Greek bouzouki band, and fireworks exploding over the Pacific. (\u201cIt was fantastic!\u201d she says.) But she does have other regrets. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot I would probably do differently,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d take more vacations\u2014getting away from work, enjoying each other in different environments. But there was always something preventing it; either he was working or I was.\u201d She made more profound mistakes as well. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t give over so much of myself, which I did at times,\u201d she admits. \u201cIt was that thing about being a nurturer; I love taking care of people, and I definitely put his needs before mine sometimes. It\u2019s seamless; somewhere along the way, you sort of lose yourself. You just don\u2019t know when it happens. It\u2019s such an insidious thing, you don\u2019t really see where it started\u2014and where you ended. There\u2019s no one to blame but yourself. I\u2019ve always been that way in relationships, even with my mom. It\u2019s not the healthiest. I feel like I\u2019ve broken the pattern now. I\u2019ll never let myself down like that again. I feel like my sense of self is being strengthened because of it.\u201d Aniston\u2019s unhappy family history colored her experience of marriage from the outset. \u201cI come from a fighting family, and I had a tough time arguing,\u201d she says. \u201cFighting scared me. I wouldn\u2019t speak up for myself. That\u2019s something I\u2019ve learned; I will always speak my mind.\u201d In recent months, the process of healing from the breakup with Brad has also created a new openness to healing relations with her mother. Their estrangement began nearly a decade ago, when Nancy Aniston gossiped about Jennifer on a television show, and worsened when she tried to cash in on Jennifer\u2019s fame by writing an appalling book called From Mother and Daughter to Friends. Jennifer severed all contact, but she is now re-assessing their relationship. \u201cWe\u2019ve exchanged messages,\u201d she says. \u201cOur doors are open. We\u2019re taking baby steps. It\u2019s a good thing.\u201d Although Aniston incurred criticism for distancing herself from her mother, who did not attend her wedding, she offers no apologies. \u201cI feel pretty good about the choices I\u2019ve made. The choice of not speaking to Mom for a while\u2014that\u2019s ours. Nobody else has to understand it. The same thing with Brad and myself,\u201d she says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change my childhood, I wouldn\u2019t change my heartaches, I wouldn\u2019t change my successes. I wouldn\u2019t change any of it, because I really love who I am, and am continuing to become. \u201cBesides, it\u2019s all in the past,\u201d she adds. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t kill you. You move on. You can\u2019t let the devastation of a divorce take over and win\u2014let it make you this bitter, closed-off, angry, skeptical person. Then you\u2019re just falling victim to it. You don\u2019t want to shut your heart down. You don\u2019t want to feel that when a marriage ends, your life is over. You can survive anything. Compared to what other people are surviving out there in the world, this is not so bad, in the grand scheme of things. Human endurance is unbelievable. Think of what mothers of soldiers have to rise above! Everything\u2019s relative.\u201d She looks down at her firm, fit body. \u201cNothing\u2019s broke,\u201d she says. Catching the quizzical look on my face, she concedes, \u201cMaybe a little bruised.\u201d\n\nA few weeks later, on a stiflingly hot day in Chicago, Aniston and I are sitting in her hotel suite looking out on Lake Michigan, which is studded with little white boats. I\u2019ve just told her about the gossip magazine that says she\u2019s registered here as \u201cMrs. Smith.\u201d The report claims Aniston is taking perverse pleasure in making hotel staffers address her as Mrs. Smith, even though they know perfectly well who she is. The only problem with this amusing tidbit is that it\u2019s not true. \u201cI wish I\u2019d thought of it,\u201d says Aniston, who is registered under an entirely different, although equally humorous, name. Despite her vow of abstinence, she succumbed to a celebrity magazine the other evening\u2014and immediately regretted it. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve fallen off the wagon,\u201d she moans. Unfortunately, the first publication she picked up featured an insult from Kimberly Stewart, Rod\u2019s party-girl daughter. \u201cShe said I\u2019m homely,\u201d Aniston says. \u201cIt literally ruined my night. I got my feelings very hurt, actually. That was my instant Karma.\u201d She has always fretted about her appearance, although that is often hard for others to believe. Posing for her Vanity Fair cover shoot, Aniston was equally fetching in French-dance-hall-girl black stockings and in a half-open oversize shirt that evoked every man\u2019s favorite just-rolled-out-of-bed look. With her tousled hair, cobalt-blue eyes, and dazzling smile, she seemed the ultimate adorable sexpot. Far from pining away in seclusion, she appeared to be sending a far more spirited message\u2014like \u201cEat your heart out, Brad!\u201d Photographed by Mario Testino for the September 2005 issue. But Aniston has never been able to reconcile the glamorous Jen on page or screen with the self-doubting woman she sees in the mirror, and the current tabloid coverage has exacerbated that gap. \u201cIt\u2019s literally two different people\u2014the real me, and the \u2018Jen\u2019 they write about, \u2018fighting back,\u2019 \u2018getting revenge\u2019\u2014everything I couldn\u2019t be farther from wanting to do,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I\u2019m back on the wagon.\u201d When she arrived in Chicago to film The Break-Up, the gossip media, frantic for a new development, immediately plunged her into a torrid romance with her co-star, Vince Vaughn. This affair apparently does not exist. \u201cI adore Vince Vaughn, but I\u2019m not going out with Vince Vaughn,\u201d she says. \u201cI barely know the guy. We\u2019ve exchanged a wine-and-cheese basket for the start of the movie, and we\u2019ve gone out to dinner with the director and other people. We\u2019ve got to get to know each other.\u201d But is Aniston seeing him\u2014or anyone else? \u201cNobody,\u201d she says firmly. \u201cI like a lot of people, but I am sooo not \u2018in like\u2019 with anybody. I am really enjoying being by myself. I\u2019m excited that I know there\u2019s somebody out there for me, but I am absolutely in no rush. This is all very fresh, very new. This was a seven-year relationship that was very dear, very complicated, very special. I need to honor it.\u201d\n\nAside from her initial flurry of tears, Aniston remains calm and thoughtful through hours of conversation with me over the course of several weeks. But there is one final topic to be addressed, and it\u2019s the most hurtful of all. The rumor that Jolie is pregnant with Pitt\u2019s child has swept around the world; some reports even have her finishing her first trimester. When I ask Aniston about that, she looks as if I\u2019ve stabbed her in the heart. Her eyes well up and spill over. Several long minutes go by as the tears keep rolling down her cheeks; she bites her lip, seemingly unable to speak. Finally she shakes her head; this subject is simply too excruciating to discuss. \u201cMy worst fear is that Jen will have to face them having a baby together soon, because that would be beyond beyond painful,\u201d says Kristin Hahn."}

The Daily Beast even used an image of the producer with Streep for an article titled: \u201cHollywood\u2019s Loud Silence on Harvey Weinstein\u2019s Sexual Harassment Allegations.\u201d\n\nHarvey Weinstein: his accusers 42 show all Harvey Weinstein: his accusers 1/42 Harvey Weinstein Harry Weinstein\u2019s reputation as one of Hollywood\u2019s leading executives was long cemented in stone. The acclaimed movie mogul, who produced Oscar-winning films Shakespeare in Love, The English Patient, and The Artist, clocked up box office successes and accolades aplenty. But this has quickly changed since a chorus of women have come forward to accuse the Hollywood producer of sexual harassment and assault. Since the New York Times\u2019 bombshell report disclosed sexual harassment and rape allegations against the film mogul dating back decades, Weinstein has been fired from his namesake company, expelled from the Oscars and has had his wife leave him. Weinstein has apologised for having \u201ccaused a lot of pain\u201d but has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex. Getty 2/42 Annabella Sciorra The Sopranos actor alleged Weinstein raped her after shooting The Night We Never Met, a 1993 movie that Weinstein produced. Similar to the stories told by other women, Weinstein drove the actor home, only to reportedly burst into Sciorra's apartment and start unbuttoning his shirt. \u201cHe shoved me onto the bed, and he got on top of me,\u201d Sciorra said. \u201cI kicked and I yelled.\u201d Weinstein then allegedly locked her arms and forced sexual intercourse on her. After the incident, Sciorra found it increasingly hard to get work, many filmmakers saying 'We heard you were difficult', something the actor claims was because of the 'Weinstein-machine'. Getty 3/42 Natassia Malthe The model and actress, who has appeared in around 50 films, said she met Weinstein at a BAFTA after party in 2008 while she was working as a spokeswoman for LG. She told a press conference in New York that she felt pressured into telling Weinstein she was staying at the Sanderson Hotel after being put on the spot. Malthe, now 43, said after her shift on February 10 she went back to her room and went to sleep, but was awoken by \"repeated pounding\" on her door, from someone yelling: \"Open the door Natassia Malthe, it's Harvey Weinstein.\" Feeling humiliated, she said she opened the door. She alleged Weinstein began implying sex would get her a role in an upcoming film while semi-undressed and then he began to masturbate. \"I was sitting on the bed talking to Harvey when he pushed me back and forced himself onto me. It was not consensual. He did not use a condom,\" she said. AP 4/42 Sean Young The actor, best known for her role in Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, said that Weinstein exposed himself to her in the early 1990s, when she was starring in the Miramax-produced Love Crimes - a production company that Weinstein headed at the time. \"I personally experienced him pulling his you-know-what out of his pants to shock me,\" she said. \"My basic response was, 'You know, Harvey, I really don\u2019t think you should be pulling that thing out, it\u2019s not very pretty.'\" Young never worked with Weinstein again after the incident. 5/42 Mimi Haleyi Mimi Haleyi said she was assaulted by Weinstein in what appeared to be a child's bedroom in his New York City apartment in 2006 when she was in her 20s. She said she was aspiring to work in television and film production when she was first introduced to him at the London premiere of The Aviator around two years earlier and he helped her get experience on the set of a TV show being produced by The Weinstein Company. But, she added, he repeatedly hassled her and even tried to force himself through her front door in an effort to get her to join him on a trip to Paris. At one point he allegedly forcibly performed oral sex on an aspiring production assistant while she was on her period. Getty 6/42 Lupita Nyong'o In an op-ed for The New York Times, the Oscar-winning actor said she was invited to Weinstein\u2019s family home in Connecticut on the premise of watching a film shortly after they met in 2011. But she said shortly after it started he \"insisted\" in front of his children that she follow him and she was led to his bedroom. The Kenyan-Mexican actress, now 34, said she felt pressured into giving him a massage after he offered her one. \"Before long he said he wanted to take off his pants,\" she wrote.\"I told him not to do that and informed him that it would make me extremely uncomfortable. He got up anyway to do so and I headed for the door, saying that I was not at all comfortable with that.\" Over the years that followed, he continued to get in touch, Nyong'o said, and when she declined another proposition she felt her career was threatened. Getty 7/42 Lena Headey Writing on social media, the Game of Thrones actor claims she first met Weinstein at the Venice Film Festival in 2005 where, after taking her for a walk by the water, he \u201cmade some suggestive comment and gesture.\u201d Headey claims she bumped into Weinstein years later where he kept asking her questions about her love life. She alleges that, when Weinstein invited her to his hotel room to show her a script, the \"energy shifted.\u201d The actor notes how, after saying she was not interesting in anything but the work, Weinstein was furious, apparently marching her back to a lift, \"grabbing and holding tightly to the back of [her] arm.\" She claims that, after paying for her car, he whispered in her ear: \"Don't tell anyone about this, not your manager, not your agent.\u201d Headey finished the post, writing: \u201cI got in the car and I cried.\u201d Getty Images 8/42 Lucia Evans The actor told The New Yorker that after a meeting to discuss casting her in various projects, Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him. \u201cI said, over and over, \u2018I don\u2019t want to do this, stop, don\u2019t\u2019.\u201d She added: \u201cHe\u2019s a big guy.

She declined and reportedly complained of his behaviour to colleagues, who later passed the information on to senior executives. An internal Weinstein Company document cited by the Times describes Nestor\u2019s encounter with Weinstein as follows: \u201cShe said he was very persistent and focused though she kept saying no for over an hour\u201d Getty 14/42 Ambra Battilana In March 2015, Battilana, an aspiring model and actress, was reportedly summoned to Weinstein\u2019s office on a Friday night to discuss her career.

The Manhattan District Attorney, Cyrus Vance, later declined to press charges, and according to the Times, \u201cmade a payment\u201d to Battilana.

When she was initially invited to a meeting with Weinstein, Judd said, she was surprised to learn the producer was in his hotel room - a tactic that recurs in other womens\u2019 accounts.

The acclaimed movie mogul, who produced Oscar-winning films Shakespeare in Love, The English Patient, and The Artist, clocked up box office successes and accolades aplenty. But this has quickly changed since a chorus of women have come forward to accuse the Hollywood producer of sexual harassment and assault. Since the New York Times\u2019 bombshell report disclosed sexual harassment and rape allegations against the film mogul dating back decades, Weinstein has been fired from his namesake company, expelled from the Oscars and has had his wife leave him. Weinstein has apologised for having \u201ccaused a lot of pain\u201d but has denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex. Getty 2/42 Annabella Sciorra The Sopranos actor alleged Weinstein raped her after shooting The Night We Never Met, a 1993 movie that Weinstein produced. Similar to the stories told by other women, Weinstein drove the actor home, only to reportedly burst into Sciorra's apartment and start unbuttoning his shirt. \u201cHe shoved me onto the bed, and he got on top of me,\u201d Sciorra said. \u201cI kicked and I yelled.\u201d Weinstein then allegedly locked her arms and forced sexual intercourse on her. After the incident, Sciorra found it increasingly hard to get work, many filmmakers saying 'We heard you were difficult', something the actor claims was because of the 'Weinstein-machine'. Getty 3/42 Natassia Malthe The model and actress, who has appeared in around 50 films, said she met Weinstein at a BAFTA after party in 2008 while she was working as a spokeswoman for LG. She told a press conference in New York that she felt pressured into telling Weinstein she was staying at the Sanderson Hotel after being put on the spot. Malthe, now 43, said after her shift on February 10 she went back to her room and went to sleep, but was awoken by \"repeated pounding\" on her door, from someone yelling: \"Open the door Natassia Malthe, it's Harvey Weinstein.\" Feeling humiliated, she said she opened the door. She alleged Weinstein began implying sex would get her a role in an upcoming film while semi-undressed and then he began to masturbate. \"I was sitting on the bed talking to Harvey when he pushed me back and forced himself onto me. It was not consensual. He did not use a condom,\" she said. AP 4/42 Sean Young The actor, best known for her role in Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, said that Weinstein exposed himself to her in the early 1990s, when she was starring in the Miramax-produced Love Crimes - a production company that Weinstein headed at the time. \"I personally experienced him pulling his you-know-what out of his pants to shock me,\" she said. \"My basic response was, 'You know, Harvey, I really don\u2019t think you should be pulling that thing out, it\u2019s not very pretty.'\" Young never worked with Weinstein again after the incident. 5/42 Mimi Haleyi Mimi Haleyi said she was assaulted by Weinstein in what appeared to be a child's bedroom in his New York City apartment in 2006 when she was in her 20s. She said she was aspiring to work in television and film production when she was first introduced to him at the London premiere of The Aviator around two years earlier and he helped her get experience on the set of a TV show being produced by The Weinstein Company. But, she added, he repeatedly hassled her and even tried to force himself through her front door in an effort to get her to join him on a trip to Paris. At one point he allegedly forcibly performed oral sex on an aspiring production assistant while she was on her period. Getty 6/42 Lupita Nyong'o In an op-ed for The New York Times, the Oscar-winning actor said she was invited to Weinstein\u2019s family home in Connecticut on the premise of watching a film shortly after they met in 2011. But she said shortly after it started he \"insisted\" in front of his children that she follow him and she was led to his bedroom. The Kenyan-Mexican actress, now 34, said she felt pressured into giving him a massage after he offered her one. \"Before long he said he wanted to take off his pants,\" she wrote.\"I told him not to do that and informed him that it would make me extremely uncomfortable. He got up anyway to do so and I headed for the door, saying that I was not at all comfortable with that.\" Over the years that followed, he continued to get in touch, Nyong'o said, and when she declined another proposition she felt her career was threatened. Getty 7/42 Lena Headey Writing on social media, the Game of Thrones actor claims she first met Weinstein at the Venice Film Festival in 2005 where, after taking her for a walk by the water, he \u201cmade some suggestive comment and gesture.\u201d Headey claims she bumped into Weinstein years later where he kept asking her questions about her love life. She alleges that, when Weinstein invited her to his hotel room to show her a script, the \"energy shifted.\u201d The actor notes how, after saying she was not interesting in anything but the work, Weinstein was furious, apparently marching her back to a lift, \"grabbing and holding tightly to the back of [her] arm.\" She claims that, after paying for her car, he whispered in her ear: \"Don't tell anyone about this, not your manager, not your agent.\u201d Headey finished the post, writing: \u201cI got in the car and I cried.\u201d Getty Images 8/42 Lucia Evans The actor told The New Yorker that after a meeting to discuss casting her in various projects, Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him. \u201cI said, over and over, \u2018I don\u2019t want to do this, stop, don\u2019t\u2019.\u201d She added: \u201cHe\u2019s a big guy. He overpowered me. I just sort of gave up. That\u2019s the most horrible part of it, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s been able to do this for so long to so many women: people give up, and then they feel like it\u2019s their fault.\u201d Getty 9/42 Laura Madden Madden, a production assistant who worked at Miramax for a decade, told the Times that Weinstein allegedly \u201cprodded her for massages at hotels,\u201d a common theme among the sources the Times\u2019s reporters spoke with. On one occasion, she claims she locked herself in his hotel bathroom, sobbing 10/42 Ashley Judd Judd recounted for the Times how Weinstein allegedly harassed her while she was filming Kiss the Girls in 1996, inviting her to his hotel room and asking her for a massage, then inviting her to watch him shower. Judd first went public with the allegations in a 2015 interview with Variety during which she discussed the experience without naming the producer involved. She described Weinstein\u2019s alleged behaviour as \u201ccoercive bargaining\u201d; \u201cI said no, a lot of ways, a lot of times, and he always came back at me with some new ask,\u201d she told the Times AFP/Getty 11/42 Rose McGowan McGowan reportedly reached a \u201cpreviously undisclosed\u201d $100,000 settlement with Weinstein in 1997, over an incident that occurred in a hotel room Getty 12/42 Mimi Haleyi Mimi Haleyi said she was assaulted by Weinstein in what appeared to be a child's bedroom in his New York City apartment in 2006 when she was in her 20s.

Getty 13/42 Emily Nestor Nestor had been temping at the Weinstein Company for only one day in 2014 when Weinstein allegedly offered to boost her career in return for sexual favours, according to the Times. She declined and reportedly complained of his behaviour to colleagues, who later passed the information on to senior executives. An internal Weinstein Company document cited by the Times describes Nestor\u2019s encounter with Weinstein as follows: \u201cShe said he was very persistent and focused though she kept saying no for over an hour\u201d Getty 14/42 Ambra Battilana In March 2015, Battilana, an aspiring model and actress, was reportedly summoned to Weinstein\u2019s office on a Friday night to discuss her career. According to a police report cited by the Times, Battilana claimed she was assaulted by Weinstein, who \u201cgrabbed her breasts after asking if they were real and put his hands up her skirt.\u201d Weinstein later claimed that Battilana had set him up, according to colleagues of his who were interviewed by the Times. The Manhattan District Attorney, Cyrus Vance, later declined to press charges, and according to the Times, \u201cmade a payment\u201d to Battilana. On 5 October, the International Business Times reported that after Vance dropped the charges, he received $10,000 from Weinstein\u2019s lawyer 15/42 Lauren O\u2019Connor Lauren O\u2019Connor, an employee of the Weinstein Company, penned a memo to executives alleging \u201ca toxic environment for women\u201d at the company.

When she approached the door, the producer reportedly greeted her dressed in just a dressing gown. \u201cI was incredibly naive and young and it did not cross my mind that this older, unattractive man would expect me to have any sexual interest in him,\u201d she wrote on Instagram. \u201cAfter declining alcohol and announcing that I had school in the morning I left, uneasy but unscathed.\u201d Theo Wargo/Getty Images 17/42 Gwyneth Paltrow The actor alleges that after he cast her in the title role of the film Emma when she was 22, he took her to his hotel room, placed his hands on her and suggested massages. \u201cI was a kid, I was signed up, I was petrified,\u201d Paltrow told the New York Times.

When she was initially invited to a meeting with Weinstein, Judd said, she was surprised to learn the producer was in his hotel room - a tactic that recurs in other womens\u2019 accounts. Echoing the accounts of other women, Judd said Weinstein suggested she give him a massage and then invited her to watch him shower.

However, she suggested she still had some healing to do.\n\n\"I think I'm still gonna go through all those bunch,\" she replied when asked if she'd done through the various grieving stages. \"I'm sure I have a hundred more heartbreaks ahead of me. We all do. But I'm a songwriter, so I'm okay with it. My favorite records are not because people lived fully happy lives. There are pockets of sadness.\"\n\nShe also said she was \"not going to be one of those artists who wallows in my misery so I can be artistic.\"\n\n\"I just want to live a life full of everything,\" she told the magazine. \"Some of that might mean nights on my porch crying, drinking whiskey, and going, \u2018Man, this sucks right now.' I don't necessarily want to know that I have really bad, long, lonely nights ahead of me, but I have had some, and I still have a bunch ahead of me.

I'm excited about those.\"\n\nIn addition, she spoke highly about her ex, who had now started dating Stefani.\n\n\" I had a great relationship and an amazing man. So I know what good is,\" she told Cosmoplitan at one point. \"I have a great launching pad for the future. I will never take that for granted.\"\n\nAnd even though she told the magazine she gave the marriage \"everything\" she had, she also admitted that marriage is a \"tough business.\"\n\n\"We were together for 10 years, married for four, were very quickly divorced, and are friends. I'm still processing everything and figuring out where to go and what happened,\" she told Cosmopolitan. \"[Marriage is] a tough business, and we gave it our best college try. I met him at 21\u2014I am now almost 32. You change as people. If I'm not a different person than I was at 21, then something's wrong with me.

Not through the prism of Hollywood or through a certain kind of life but really take them into the world where they have a really good sense and become rounded people.\u201d\n\nMore about Angelina Jolie\n\nJolie is an American actress, filmmaker, and humanitarian is \u201cgetting married\u201d to a \u201cwealthy Brit,\u201d reports In Touch.

{"label": false, "txt": "Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes have remained tight-lipped about their relationship, but a rare appearance together has everyone talking about the long-rumored couple.\n\nFoxx and Holmes looked every bit the happy couple at Clive Davis\u2018 annual Pre-Grammy Awards Gala over the weekend. Though the two arrived separately, they sat together at the same table once inside the star-studded event.\n\nBut it appeared the actress tried to avoid drawing attention to herself by leaving the room and moving to a different seat just moments before Davis announced the singer\u2019s presence.\n\nHowever, Davis called out the move, saying, \u201cThis lady left the room right when I was going to introduce her, she was sitting at that table right with Jamie Foxx and everyone else.\u201d\n\nDavis added, \u201cIf you\u2019re going to sit together what better night than tonight?\u201d\n\nKevin Mazur/Getty Images\n\nAnd this isn\u2019t the first time they have been caught looking rather coupley together.\n\nIn September, the stars were spotted walking hand in hand along the sand barefoot in Malibu, relaunching years-long buzz about a romance. And on Wednesday, the two celebrated the actor\u2019s 50th birthday with a night out in Los Angeles. They were seen leaving the Highlight Room together.\n\nAlthough they\u2019ve never officially confirmed a relationship, multiple sources have told PEOPLE the ultra-private pair have been spending time together for years.\n\nIn 2015, a source told PEOPLE they weren\u2019t getting serious. \u201cThis is not some intense romance,\u201d the source said. \u201cJamie and Katie are friends and have been for a long time. They are two adults who are attractive and single, and so apparently conclusions will be drawn. But contrary to those conclusions, they\u2019re not about to run off and make some serious commitment.\u201d\n\nAdded a Foxx source at the time: \u201c[They] see each other and go out together, but Jamie would tell you he is not involved with anyone seriously. [He]\u2019s a workaholic and couldn\u2019t be happier in his life as it is.\u201d\n\nDOBN/RMBI/BACKGRID\n\nThe pair first made headlines when they hit the dance floor together at the Apollo in the Hamptons event in East Hampton, New York, in 2013, a little over a year after Holmes and Tom Cruise split in 2012 after six years of marriage. They jammed out to Robin Thicke\u2019s summer anthem, \u201cBlurred Lines\u201d and Foxx\u2019s 2009 hit \u201cBlame It (On the Alcohol)\u201d at the benefit concert.\n\nThe actor and musician denied that he and Holmes were an item following the encounter.\n\n\u201c[The rumors] are one hundred percent not true. In fact, it\u2019s quite hilarious because we simply danced at a charity event along with a lot of other people,\u201d he told Entertainment Tonight at the time.\n\nRELATED ViDEO: Are Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx Dating?\n\nSince then, the two have occasionally been spotting visiting each in L.A., where they have homes not far from each other. A new round of rumors surfaced in 2016 after the actress stepped out in New York City wearing a diamond ring (which she\u2019d been sporting for months) while Foxx was spotted wearing a gold band.\n\nFoxx\u2019s rep told PEOPLE at the time that the movie stars were neither engaged nor married.\n\nThis spring, Foxx, 49, and Holmes, 38, were spotted spending time together in Paris.\n\nHolmes met up at a hotel with Foxx, who had been in the City of Lights to shoot his new Robin Hood movie, sources confirmed at the time. (Meanwhile, Cruise was working on the sixth installment of his Mission: Impossible franchise a few blocks away.)\n\n\n\nWhile the actress kept a low profile during her Paris stay, though she did stop by Luc Besson\u2019s studio Cit\u00e9 du Cinemas, where Foxx was filming. Later, the duo were photographed boarding a private jet together out of the city.\n\nDOBN/RMBI/BACKGRID\n\nHolmes and Foxx\u2019s stroll on the beach in Malibu this Monday was a rarely-photographed outing for the ultra-discreet duo. They splashed around in the water, with Foxx venturing knee-deep into the waves fully dressed.\n\nAn eyewitness told Entertainment Tonight that they were on a public beach after visiting a friend\u2019s house in the area.

She appeared to be enjoying herself and looked happy.\u201d\n\nIn a November 2014 cover story, Holmes told PEOPLE that she \u201cabsolutely\u201d still believes in love.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a very loving person,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course I\u2019m open to finding love again.\u201d"}

The \"Horrible Bosses\" star could not attend gym classes or jog around the Hyde Park. The only thing she can do is visit Kate Middleton.

{"label": false, "txt": "Jennifer Lawrence is an American actress who is best-known for her role as Katniss in The Hunger Games, but you might also know her from her role as Mystique in X-Men. She was once named one of the most influential people in the world back in the year 2013, but she has since been heard making some pretty questionable remarks that have people all over the world angry with her. Jennifer is known to be a very attractive young actress, but she hasn't exactly had the best of luck with men during her time in the spotlight, and that left us wondering what it is about this beautiful woman that has men running away faster than they could say bye.\n\nRELATED: Jennifer Lawrence's Response To Brad Pitt Dating Rumors\n\nIt turns out that this actress is not nearly as wonderful as we once thought she was, but perhaps if she just lightened up a bit and decided to be comfortable with herself, maybe she wouldn\u2019t be so bad. Even though she may be referred to as \u201cAmerica\u2019s Sweetheart\u201d in the media, people are starting to see past her sweetheart act and realized that a lot of the stuff that she says and does make her look like the exact opposite of a sweetheart. From her sketchy dating history to her not-so-nice comments, it is no wonder why men are steering clear. There have been many failed relationships throughout the years with the actress and after doing some research we have compiled a list of 15 reasons why she might just be every Hollywood man\u2019s worst nightmare.\n\nadvertising\n\n15 She Does Not Use Social Media\n\nvia: etonline.com\n\nSocial media has blown up over the years\u2014it has just about taken over phone calls and texting, and just about everyone you know has it. There are even grandparents on Facebook using it as a way to communicate with their family. There are a ton of social media platforms out there that have taken over the lives of many people. For instance, Facebook has become the biggest social media platform that there is and it has done wonders for connecting people, but it has also been a huge relationship destroyer.\n\nAlthough Jennifer Lawrence does have some social media accounts out there, she only ever uses them if she has absolutely no other choice. The actress has said that she hates the idea of social media and the people who use it, so obviously she does not want the men that she dates to be active social media users. This might not seem like a crazy request at first, but for people in Hollywood, social media plays a big part in how they market things. So, this could very easily be a reason why men aren\u2019t too keen on Jennifer.\n\n14 She Is Super Awkward\n\nvia: youtube.com\n\nadvertising\n\nWe all know how awkward dating and relationships can be, especially in the beginning before you really know the person that you are seeing, but sometimes that awkwardness doesn't go away after knowing each other for a while. Let\u2019s be honest, most men don\u2019t want to spend their lives with a woman who never gets comfortable with them or is unable to let loose.\n\nRELATED: Times Jennifer Lawrence Was Too Much To Handle\n\nFor Jennifer Lawrence, dating is as awkward as it gets, romance is often times something that she laughs about, and intimacy is just downright weird to her. That\u2019s not saying that she doesn't enjoy romance, but she definitely does not know how to take it seriously. How is a man supposed to take her out on a nice date or share an intimate moment with her, if she isn\u2019t taking it seriously? Maybe this has played a role in her failed relationships thus far.\n\n13 She Has A Long History Of Exes\n\nvia: metro.co.uk\n\nIf you are the average person, then you have probably had your fair share of ex-boyfriends or girlfriends. This is totally normal. After all, you don't want to just settle down with the first person that you meet. Instead, you want to see what's out there and make sure you are settling down with the right person for you. When you are under the spotlight, however, everyone tends to know your dating history.\n\nWhen you are as popular as Jennifer Lawrence is, the people who you have dated are certainly not a secret, and things like how long you have been with someone, and just about every date you have ever gone on is no longer confidential. For instance, we know that Jennifer has dated Nicholas Hoult, Chris Martin, Liam Hemsworth, Darren Aronofsky, and Graham Martin, just to name a few. It is possible that news of who she has dated in the past, or how many people she has dated in the past, has had an impact on how other men in Hollywood feel about her.\n\n12 She Wants To Jump Into Marriage\n\nvia: popsugar.com\n\nadvertising\n\nMarriage is a sacred bond that two people enter into together and it usually does not happen until they have spent at least a couple of years getting to know one another. It is a very touchy subject to some people, mostly men because they do not want to feel rushed or pressured into having to commit to just one person for the rest of their lives. So, it is safe to say that marriage is usually a topic that you would hold off on until you have known each other for a long time and are nice and comfortable with one another.\n\nJennifer Lawrence must not have gotten that memo because, in an interview, she talked about how she would love to jump into a marriage. In fact, she said that she knows exactly what she wants in a man and that if she were to find that perfect man, she definitely would not hesitate to talk marriage. It is easy to see why news of this might scare away any potential boyfriends, especially Hollywood men, who are already so committed to their careers.\n\n11 She Has Body Image Issues\n\nvia: giphy.com\n\nBody image issues are something that almost all women struggle with today, especially when we feel as though we have to live up to the expectations set by female figures in Hollywood. So it may come as a surprise to some of you that Jennifer Lawrence struggles with these issues herself, for others though, it is quite obvious. Jennifer has said in interviews that in Hollywood, as an actress, she is considered to be obese. Apparently, you have to be super tiny to live up to that awesome Hollywood standard, but you would probably agree with us when we say that she looks great!\n\nThere have been some rumors circulating that she may or may not have an eating disorder, and she always seems to be shoving food in her mouth and joking about eating, but again, these are just rumors. Regardless of whether the rumors are true, no man likes it when a girl calls herself fat or doesn't see herself the way that they see her. Sometimes it can even take its toll on a relationship, so it is a strong possibility that men are leaving whenever they notice her bad habit.\n\n10 Her Striking Good Looks Could Make Any Man Paranoid\n\nvia: pinterest.com\n\nadvertising\n\nDespite the fact that Jennifer Lawrence does not see herself the way that most of us see her, we have to be honest and admit the fact that she is beautiful. One would think that men would be throwing themselves at her and that they would be super happy to say that they were able to land someone as hot as her, but that does not seem to be the case at all. Maybe this has something to do with the fact that they have self-image issues themselves, but it could also be that they are intimidated by how good-looking she is and do not find her approachable. Some men refuse to date women who are significantly more attractive than they are because they are afraid that it will make them look bad. This could most certainly be a big reason as to why she is ever Hollywood man\u2019s worst nightmare when it comes to dating.\n\nRELATED: Jennifer Lawrence's Hair And Makeup Evolution In Photos\n\n9 She Wants Someone Who Does Not Know Who She Is\n\nvia: cnn.com\n\nWhen you are an actor or actress in Hollywood and have starred in some pretty big name movies and shows like Jennifer has, then it is safe to say that you would be hard-pressed to go somewhere where no one knows who you are. Which is why it came as such a shocker when Jennifer Lawrence said that her ideal man would have no idea who she was. It is easy to see why she would like to meet someone who does not know who she is because when you are in the spotlight like she has been, rumors come out and everyone tends to think that they know everything about you when really they know nothing. However, if she is waiting to settle down with a guy until she does meet someone who does not know here, then she might be waiting for a very long time, possibly even forever.\n\nadvertising\n\n8 She Is Extremely Successful\n\nvia: urnaija.com\n\nadvertising\n\nWhen it comes to dating and relationships, there are a lot of men out there who like to be the successful ones in the relationship, mainly in terms of a career. This could be an issue for Jennifer Lawrence because of just how successful she is as an actress. Some men could find this to be a huge turn-off, or they could be intimidated by the fact that she is better off in her career than they are. There is nothing wrong with a little jealousy, but it is clear to see why some Hollywood men might find her to be a nightmare to date, especially if everyone is talking about her she is landing roles, while they seem to be having trouble landing roles themselves.\n\nOf course, this does not speak for all Hollywood men, as there are men out there who are more successful than her, as well as men who do not become so easily jealous. However, this combined with all of her other little quirks, is definitely something that could drive men away before a first date would even take place.\n\n7 She Is Always Lying\n\nvia: dailymail.co.uk\n\nWe all tell some white lies throughout our lives and usually, we are able to do this without anyone finding out or dealing with any repercussions. Lying is typically frowned upon, but let\u2019s be honest here, who hasn\u2019t said they were sick to get out of going to work or said that they loved the food that their mom cooked when really, it was atrocious? It is safe to say that everyone on earth has lied a good handful of times in their lives and sometimes we do it without even realizing that we are doing it. There are, however, people out there who take lying too far, and that is never a trait that someone wants in a significant other.\n\nWhen you are someone like Jennifer Lawrence however, and just about every moment of your life is closely followed by almost the entire world, even the smallest lie is usually discovered. For instance, when Jennifer Lawrence told the world that she would be taking a year off of acting to focus on activism, it was really just her way of saying that she wanted to take a little time off before decided what movie to get into next but that she didn\u2019t want to sound lazy for doing it. It was quickly discovered that she was not doing a single thing for activism and the articles about her many lies started to spread like wildfire.\n\n6 She Is Very Intimidating\n\nvia: themarysue.com\n\nadvertising\n\nThere are plenty of strong, independent, and tough women out there these days. Some of these women are stronger than most men and could take them in a fight with no problem at all. While Jennifer Lawrence is not necessarily the strongest woman out there, she has been known to be able to stand up for herself and could take on a few guys she knows. The actress attributes this to the fact that she was raised in a house full of boys and was forbidden from playing with and making friends with all the girls in her neighborhood. This ultimately led her to take on more of a tomboy role in life, and she learned how to think, talk, and act like a boy. It also leads her to become quite competitive, and she definitely does not take any BS from anyone. With all of that being said, this is something that a lot of Hollywood men might find to be a huge turn-off because most of them want a more sweet and traditional female in their lives.\n\n5 She Takes On Some Crazy Roles\n\nvia: youtube.com\n\nActing is a difficult talent to have, for some it comes naturally, but for others, it takes a lot of hard work and dedication. It can be tough to fall into certain roles, especially the ones that you have no real life experiences to associate it with. Yet somehow, the acting in all the TV shows and movies that you see today is so believable in the final cut. If it were not for actors and actresses coming out and talking about how difficult it is in interviews, we would not know just how much work goes into portraying yourself as someone totally different.\n\nToo bad the same can not be said for Jennifer Lawrence because, in the movies where she plays a totally crazy girl, she makes it look so believable that we started to question whether she was really acting or not. Maybe acting just comes that naturally to her, perhaps she is just so good that she can play any personality without any issues at all. However, she has mentioned that she loves playing the role of a crazy girl, and maybe that\u2019s because she is a little crazy herself. This could be a pretty big reason why she is every Hollywood man\u2019s worst nightmare.\n\n4 She Runs Away When Things Get Real\n\nvia: isthismoviesuitable.com\n\nadvertising\n\nThere are two different types of people out there in the dating world \u2014 the ones who are ready to commit and be loyal, and then there are the ones who run at the first sight of anything too serious. Jennifer Lawrence just so happens to be the type that runs away from serious relationships. This may be hard to believe, seeing as how she has talked about being ready for marriage, but it is true. She has not taken a single one of her relationships seriously, and word has it that whenever even the slightest disagreement comes up, she runs away from the conversation and cuts her ties with that person instead of talking things out like a normal person would. It is obvious why this would be a turn-off for many men, and even more obvious as to why this would make her a nightmare for any Hollywood man.\n\n3 She Is Against Feminism\n\nvia: rumorsfeed.com\n\nJennifer Lawrence has dubbed herself a full-on feminist, which is the cool thing to be in Hollywood these days, but actions speak louder than words, and her actions have certainly shown us differently over the years. Maybe it was the strict household that she lived in and growing up not being allowed to play with other girls that made her take gender roles more seriously than most. Jennifer Lawrence was told growing up that she was not allowed to play with other girls, and other than her mother, she was the only female in her household. She was taught to play rough with the boys, walk, talk, and act like a boy. So, maybe this is why she is so set in her ways when it comes to what a woman should and should not do, although some people might think that this should have made her grow into a woman who thought differently.\n\n2 She Conforms To Gender Roles\n\nvia: youtube.com\n\nadvertising\n\nGrowing up, Jennifer Lawrence had quite a few brothers but no sisters. In fact, she and her mom were the only women in their household. She grew up watching her mom having dinner cooked and on the table, ready for her father when he would arrive home from work, and how she was expected to handle all of the cleaning, cooking, and children on her own. Of course, seeing her mom handle all of these things on her own probably should have made her realize that was not what she wanted for herself, or that any woman should have to conform to these basic gender roles, but instead she grew up believing that this way the way things should be, and she still thinks that way to this day. Of course, this will be a definite plus for anyone that she ends up marrying, but it is not how things should be.\n\n1 Her Romantic Roles With Male Actors\n\nvia: independant.co.uk\n\nHollywood movies often times tend to be filled with passionate and intimate moments between an actor and actress, and although these are just scenes of two people acting, they often times do involve the two people being very close. This could be a problem in many Hollywood relationships, It can't be easy watching your partner be that up close and personal with another man or woman.\n\nJennifer Lawrence is certainly no stranger to these kinds of scenes and although she has admitted that she hates doing those scenes and finds them to awkward and weird, it could certainly play a role in any relationship that she enters into. After all, she is a very attractive woman, despite what she might think about herself. So, seeing her do these scenes with other just as attractive men could be very hard on someone that she is dating.\n\nNEXT: Pics Of Jennifer Lawrence That Are Hot AF\n\nadvertising\n\nGive TheRichest a Thumbs up!"}

{"label": false, "txt": "\"Springsteen\" redirects here. For other uses, see Springsteen (disambiguation)\n\nBruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen (born September 23, 1949) is an American singer-songwriter and musician, known for his work with the E Street Band. Nicknamed \"The Boss\", he is widely known for his brand of poetic lyrics, his Jersey Shore roots, his distinctive voice, and his lengthy and energetic stage performances.\n\nSpringsteen's recordings have included both commercially accessible rock albums and more somber folk-oriented works. His most successful studio albums, Born to Run (1975) and Born in the U.S.A. (1984) find pleasures in the struggles of daily American life. He has sold more than 135 million records worldwide and more than 64 million records in the United States, making him one of the world's best-selling artists of all time.[1][2] He has earned numerous awards for his work, including 20 Grammy Awards, two Golden Globes, an Academy Award, a Tony Award (for Springsteen on Broadway) as well as being inducted into both the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame in 1999. In 2009, Springsteen was a Kennedy Center Honors recipient, in 2013 was named MusiCares person of the year, and in 2016 was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[3]\n\nSpringsteen married Patti Scialfa in 1991. Their three children are Evan James Springsteen, Jessica Rae Springsteen, and Sam Ryan Springsteen.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nBruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen was born on September 23, 1949, at Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch, New Jersey.[4] He was brought home from the hospital to Freehold Borough where he spent his childhood. He lived on South Street and attended Freehold Borough High School. His father, Douglas Frederick Springsteen, was of Dutch and Irish ancestry, and worked as a bus driver, among other vocations, but was unemployed most of the time. Springsteen said his mother, Adele Ann (n\u00e9e Zerilli), a legal secretary and of Italian ancestry, was the main breadwinner.[5][6] His maternal grandfather was born in Vico Equense, a town near Naples.[7] He has two younger sisters, Virginia and Pamela. Pamela had a brief film career, but left acting to pursue still photography full-time; she took photos for his Human Touch, Lucky Town and The Ghost of Tom Joad albums.\n\nSpringsteen's last name is topographic and of Dutch origin, literally translating to \"jumping stone\" but more generally meaning a kind of stone used as a stepping stone in unpaved streets or between two houses.[8] The Springsteens are among the early Dutch families who settled in the colony of New Netherland in the 1600s.\n\nRaised a Catholic, Springsteen attended the St. Rose of Lima Catholic school in Freehold Borough, where he was at odds with the nuns and rejected the strictures imposed upon him, even though some of his later music reflects a Catholic ethos and includes a few rock-influenced, traditional Irish-Catholic hymns.[9] In a 2012 interview, he explained that it was his Catholic upbringing rather than political ideology that most influenced his music. He noted in the interview that his faith had given him a \"very active spiritual life\", although he joked that this \"made it very difficult sexually.\" He added: \"Once a Catholic, always a Catholic.\"[10]\n\nIn ninth grade, Springsteen began attending the public Freehold High School, but did not fit in there either. Former teachers have said he was a \"loner, who wanted nothing more than to play his guitar.\" He graduated in 1967, but felt so uncomfortable that he skipped the ceremony.[11] He briefly attended Ocean County College, but dropped out.[9]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\n1964\u20131972: Early years [ edit ]\n\nThis was different, shifted the lay of the land. Four guys, playing and singing, writing their own material ... Rock 'n' roll came to my house where there seemed to be no way out ... and opened up a whole world of possibilities. \u2014Bruce Springsteen, on the impact of The Beatles[12]\n\nSpringsteen grew up hearing fellow New Jersey singer Frank Sinatra on the radio. He became interested in being involved in music himself when, in 1956 and 1957, at the age of seven, he saw Elvis Presley on The Ed Sullivan Show. Soon after this his mother rented him a guitar from Mike Diehl's Music in Freehold for $6 a week but it failed to provide him with the 'instant gratification' he desired.[13] In 1964, Springsteen saw the three Beatles appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show and, inspired, he bought his first guitar for $18.95 at the Western Auto Appliance Store.[14][12] Thereafter he started playing for audiences with a band called the Rogues at local venues such as the Elks Lodge in Freehold. In late 1964, Springsteen's mother took out a loan to buy her 16-year-old son a $60 Kent guitar, an act he subsequently memorialized in his song \"The Wish\". The following year, he went to the house of Tex and Marion Vinyard, who sponsored young bands in town. They helped him become the lead guitarist and subsequently one of the lead singers of the Castiles. His first gig with the Castiles was possibly at a trailer park on New Jersey Route 34. The Castiles recorded two original songs at a public recording studio in Brick Township and played a variety of venues, including Cafe Wha? in Greenwich Village. Marion Vinyard said that she believed the young Springsteen when he promised he would make it big.[15][16]\n\nCalled for conscription in the United States Armed Forces when he was 18, Springsteen failed the physical examination and did not serve in the Vietnam War. He had suffered a concussion in a motorcycle accident when he was 17, and this together with his \"crazy\" behavior at induction gave him a classification of 4F, which made him unacceptable for service.[17]\n\nIn the late-1960s, Springsteen performed briefly in a power trio known as Earth, playing in clubs in New Jersey, with one major show at the Hotel Diplomat in New York City. Earth consisted of John Graham on bass, and Mike Burke on drums. Bob Alfano was later added on organ, but was replaced for two gigs by Frank 'Flash' Craig.[15]\n\nOrdinary life in New Jersey beach towns such as Asbury Park are the background to Springsteen's early lyrics\n\nFrom 1969 through early 1971, Springsteen performed with Steel Mill (originally called Child), which included Danny Federici, Vini Lopez, Vinnie Roslin and later Steve Van Zandt and Robbin Thompson. During this time he performed regularly at venues on the Jersey Shore, in Richmond, Virginia,[18] Nashville, Tennessee, and a set of gigs in California,[15] quickly gathering a cult following. San Francisco Examiner music critic Philip Elwood gave Springsteen credibility in his glowing assessment of Steel Mill: \"I have never been so overwhelmed by totally unknown talent.\" Elwood went on to praise their \"cohesive musicality\" and, in particular, singled out Springsteen as \"a most impressive composer\".\n\nOther acts followed over the next two years, as Springsteen sought to shape a unique and genuine musical and lyrical style: Dr. Zoom & the Sonic Boom (early- to mid-1971), the Sundance Blues Band (mid-1971), and the Bruce Springsteen Band (mid-1971 to mid-1972). With the addition of pianist David Sancious, the core of what would later become the E Street Band was formed, with occasional temporary additions such as horn sections, the Zoomettes (a group of female backing vocalists for Dr. Zoom) and Southside Johnny Lyon on harmonica. Musical genres explored included blues, R&B, jazz, church music, early rock 'n' roll, and soul, with major influences being Joe Cocker's Mad Dogs and Englishmen, Leon Russell and Van Morrison.[15]\n\nSpringsteen acquired the nickname \"The Boss\" during this period; when he played club gigs with a band he took on the task of collecting the band's nightly pay and distributing it amongst his bandmates.[19] The nickname also reportedly sprang from games of Monopoly that Springsteen would play with other Jersey Shore musicians.[20] Springsteen is not fond of this nickname, due to his dislike of bosses,[19] but seems to have since tacitly accepted it. Previously he had the nickname \"Doctor\".[21][22]\n\nHis prolific songwriting ability (with \"more words in some individual songs than other artists had in whole albums\", as his future record label would describe it in early publicity campaigns) brought his skills to the attention of several people who were about to change his life: New managers Mike Appel and Jim Cretecos, who in turn brought him to the attention of Columbia Records talent scout John Hammond. Hammond auditioned Springsteen in May 1972.\n\nEven after Springsteen gained international acclaim, his New Jersey roots showed through in his music, and he often praised \"the great state of New Jersey\" in his live shows. Drawing on his extensive local appeal, he has routinely sold out consecutive nights in major New Jersey, Philadelphia and New York venues. He has also made many surprise appearances at The Stone Pony and other shore nightclubs over the years.\n\n1972\u20131974: Initial struggle for success [ edit ]\n\nSpringsteen was signed to Columbia Records in 1972 by Clive Davis, after having initially piqued the interest of John Hammond, who had signed Bob Dylan to the same label a decade earlier. Despite the expectations of Columbia Records' executives that Springsteen would record an acoustic album, he brought many of his New Jersey-based colleagues into the studio with him, thus forming the E Street Band (although it would not be formally named for several months). His debut album Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J., released in January 1973, established him as a critical favorite[23] though sales were slow.\n\nBecause of Springsteen's lyrical poeticism and folk rock-rooted music exemplified on tracks like \"Blinded by the Light\"[note 1] and \"For You\", as well as the Columbia and Hammond connections, critics initially compared Springsteen to Bob Dylan. \"He sings with a freshness and urgency I haven't heard since I was rocked by 'Like a Rolling Stone'\" wrote Crawdaddy magazine editor Peter Knobler in Springsteen's first interview/profile in March 1973. Photographs for that original profile were taken by Ed Gallucci.[24][25] Crawdaddy discovered Springsteen in the rock press and was his earliest champion. Knobler profiled him in Crawdaddy three times, in 1973, 1975 and 1978.[26] (Springsteen and the E Street Band acknowledged the magazine's support by giving a private performance at the Crawdaddy 10th Anniversary Party in New York City in June 1976.)[27] Music critic Lester Bangs wrote in Creem in 1975 that when Springsteen's first album was released \"... many of us dismissed it: he wrote like Bob Dylan and Van Morrison, sang like Van Morrison and Robbie Robertson, and led a band that sounded like Van Morrison's\".[28] The track \"Spirit in the Night\" especially showed Morrison's influence, while \"Lost in the Flood\" was the first of many portraits of Vietnam veterans, and \"Growin' Up\", his first take on the recurring theme of adolescence.\n\nIn September 1973, Springsteen's second album The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle was released, again to critical acclaim but no commercial success. Springsteen's songs became grander in form and scope, with the E Street Band providing a less folksy, more R&B vibe, and the lyrics often romanticized teenage street life. \"4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)\" and \"Incident on 57th Street\" would become fan favorites, and the long, rousing \"Rosalita (Come Out Tonight)\" continues to rank among Springsteen's most beloved concert numbers.\n\nIn the May 22, 1974 issue of Boston's The Real Paper music critic Jon Landau wrote, after seeing a performance at the Harvard Square Theater, \"I saw rock and roll future, and its name is Bruce Springsteen. And on a night when I needed to feel young, he made me feel like I was hearing music for the very first time.\"[29] Landau helped to finish the epic new album Born to Run and subsequently became Springsteen's manager and producer. Given an enormous budget in a last-ditch effort at a commercially viable record, Springsteen became bogged down in the recording process while striving for a \"Wall of Sound\" production. But fed by the release of an early mix of \"Born to Run\" to nearly a dozen radio stations, anticipation built toward the album's release.[30]\n\nThe album took more than 14 months to record, with six months spent on the song \"Born to Run\". During this time, Springsteen battled with anger and frustration over the album, saying he heard \"sounds in [his] head\" that he could not explain to the others in the studio. It was during these recording sessions that \"Miami\" Steve Van Zandt would stumble into the studio just in time to help Springsteen organize the horn section on \"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\". Van Zandt, who would eventually join the E Street Band, had been a longtime friend of Springsteen, as well as a collaborator on earlier musical projects, and understood where he was coming from, which helped him to translate some of the sounds Springsteen was hearing. Still, by the end of the grueling recording sessions Springsteen was not satisfied, and upon first hearing the finished album, threw it into the alley and told Jon Landau he would rather just cut it live at The Bottom Line (a place he often played).[31]\n\n1975\u20131983: Breakthrough [ edit ]\n\nOn August 13, 1975, Springsteen and the E Street Band began a five-night, 10-show stand at New York's The Bottom Line club. This attracted major media attention and was broadcast live on WNEW-FM. (Decades later, Rolling Stone magazine would name the stand as one of the 50 Moments That Changed Rock and Roll.)[32] Oklahoma City rock radio station WKY, in association with Carson Attractions, staged an experimental promotional event that resulted in a sold out house at the (6,000 seat) Civic Center Music Hall. With the release of Born to Run on August 25, 1975, Springsteen finally found success. The album peaked at No. 3 on the Billboard 200, and while reception at US top 40 radio outlets for the album's two singles was not overwhelming (\"Born to Run\" reached a modest No. 23 on the Billboard charts, and \"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\" peaked at No. 83), almost every track on the album received album-oriented rock airplay, especially \"Born to Run\", \"Thunder Road\", \"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out,\" and \"Jungleland\", all of which remain perennial favorites on many classic rock stations.\n\nSpringsteen appeared on the covers of both Time and Newsweek in the same week, on October 27 of that year. So great did the wave of publicity become that he eventually rebelled against it during his first venture overseas, tearing down promotional posters before a concert appearance in London.\n\nSpringsteen and the E Street Band, 1977\n\nA legal battle with former manager Mike Appel kept Springsteen out of the studio for nearly a year, during which time he kept the E Street Band together through extensive touring across the U.S. Despite the optimistic fervor with which he often performed, Springsteen's new songs sounded more somber than much of his previous work. Reaching settlement with Appel in 1977, Springsteen returned to the studio, and the subsequent sessions produced Darkness on the Edge of Town (1978). Musically, this album was a turning point in Springsteen's career. Gone were the raw, rapid-fire lyrics, outsized characters, and long, multi-part musical compositions of the first three albums; the songs were leaner and more carefully drawn and began to reflect Springsteen's growing intellectual and political awareness. The cross-country 1978 tour to promote the album would become legendary for the intensity and length of its shows.[33]\n\nBy the late 1970s, Springsteen had earned a reputation in the pop world as a songwriter whose material could provide hits for other bands. Manfred Mann's Earth Band had achieved a US No. 1 pop hit with a heavily rearranged version of Greetings' \"Blinded by the Light\" in early 1977. Patti Smith reached No. 13 with her take on Springsteen's unreleased \"Because the Night\" (with revised lyrics by Smith) in 1978, while The Pointer Sisters hit No. 2 in 1979 with Springsteen's also unreleased \"Fire\". Although not a critical success, long time friend Southside Johnny recorded Springsteen's \"The Fever\" in early 1976 and \"Talk to Me\" in 1978. The two of them along with Steve Van Zandt collaborated to produce \"Trapped Again\" in 1978.\n\nIn September 1979, Springsteen and the E Street Band joined the Musicians United for Safe Energy anti-nuclear power collective at Madison Square Garden for two nights, playing an abbreviated set while premiering two songs from his upcoming album. The subsequent No Nukes live album, as well as the following summer's No Nukes documentary film, represented the first official recordings and footage of Springsteen's fabled live act, as well as Springsteen's first tentative dip into political involvement.\n\nSpringsteen continued to focus on working-class life with the 20-song double album The River in 1980, which included an intentionally paradoxical range of material from good-time party rockers to emotionally intense ballads, and finally yielded his first hit Top Ten single as a performer, \"Hungry Heart\". Like the previous two albums, musical styles on The River were derived largely from rock 'n' roll music of the 50s and 60s, but with a more explicit pop-rock sound than earlier albums. This is apparent in the adoption of Eighties pop-rock hallmarks like the reverberating-tenor drums, very basic percussion/guitar and repetitive lyrics apparent in many of the tracks. The title song pointed to Springsteen's intellectual direction, while a couple of the lesser-known tracks presaged his musical direction. The album sold well, becoming his first No. 1 on the Billboard Pop Albums chart, and a long tour in 1980 and 1981 followed, which included Springsteen's first extended tour of Europe and ending with a series of multi-night arena stands in major cities in the U.S.\n\nThe River was followed in 1982 by the stark solo acoustic Nebraska. Recording sessions had been held to expand on a demo tape Springsteen had made at his home on a simple, low-tech four-track tape deck. However, during the recording process Springsteen and producer Jon Landau realized the songs worked better as solo acoustic numbers than full band renditions and the original demo tape was released as the album. Although the recordings of the E Street Band were shelved, other songs from these sessions would later be released, including \"Born in the U.S.A\" and \"Glory Days\". According to the Marsh biographies, Springsteen was depressed when he wrote this material, and the result is a brutal depiction of American life. While Nebraska did not sell as well as Springsteen's three previous albums, it garnered widespread critical praise (including being named \"Album of the Year\" by Rolling Stone magazine's critics) and influenced later works by other major artists, including U2's album The Joshua Tree. Springsteen did not tour in conjunction with Nebraska's release.\n\n1984\u20131991: Commercial and popular phenomenon [ edit ]\n\nSpringsteen is probably best known for his album Born in the U.S.A. (1984), which sold 15 million copies in the U.S., 30 million worldwide, and became one of the best-selling albums of all time with seven singles hitting the Top 10. The title track was a bitter commentary on the treatment of Vietnam veterans, some of whom were Springsteen's friends. The lyrics in the verses were entirely unambiguous when listened to, but the anthemic music and the title of the song made it hard for many, from politicians to the common person, to get the lyrics\u2014except those in the chorus, which could be read many ways.[34] The song made a huge political impact, as he was advocating for the rights of the common working-class man.[35]\n\nThe song was widely misinterpreted as jingoistic, and in connection with the 1984 presidential campaign became the subject of considerable folklore. In 1984, conservative columnist George Will attended a Springsteen concert and then wrote a column praising Springsteen's work ethic. Six days after the column was printed, in a campaign rally in Hammonton, New Jersey, Reagan said, \"America's future rests in a thousand dreams inside your hearts. It rests in the message of hope in the songs of a man so many young Americans admire\u2014New Jersey's own, Bruce Springsteen.\" Two nights later, at a concert in Pittsburgh, Springsteen told the crowd, \"Well, the president was mentioning my name in his speech the other day and I kind of got to wondering what his favorite album of mine must've been, you know? I don't think it was the Nebraska album. I don't think he's been listening to this one.\" He then began playing \"Johnny 99\", with its allusions to closing factories and criminals.[36]\n\nSpringsteen also turned down several million dollars offered by the Chrysler Corporation to use \"Born in the U.S.A.\" in a car commercial. In later years, to eliminate the bombast and make the song's original meaning more explicitly clear, Springsteen performed the song accompanied only by acoustic guitar, thus returning to how the song was originally conceived. The original acoustic version of the song, recorded in 1982 during the Nebraska sessions, appeared on the 1998 archival release Tracks.\n\n\"Dancing in the Dark\" was the biggest of seven hit singles from Born in the U.S.A., peaking at No. 2 on the Billboard music charts. The video for the song showed a young Courteney Cox dancing on stage with Springsteen, which helped start the actress's career. The song \"Cover Me\" was written by Springsteen for Donna Summer, but his record company persuaded him to keep it for the new album. A big fan of Summer's work, Springsteen wrote another song for her, \"Protection\". Videos for the album were directed by Brian De Palma and John Sayles. Springsteen played on the \"We Are the World\" song and album in 1985. His live single \"Trapped\" from that album received moderate airplay on US Top 40 stations as well as reaching No. 1 on the Billboard Top Rock Tracks chart.[37]\n\nDuring the Born in the U.S.A. Tour, Springsteen met actress Julianne Phillips, whom he would marry in 1985. He also that year took part in the recording of the USA For Africa charity song \"We Are The World\"; however he declined to play at Live Aid. He later stated that he \"simply did not realise how big the whole thing was going to be\". He has since expressed regret at turning down Bob Geldof's invitation, stating that he could have played a couple of acoustic songs had there been no slot available for a full band performance.\n\nThe Born in the U.S.A. period represented the height of Springsteen's visibility in popular culture and the broadest audience he would ever reach (aided by the release of Arthur Baker's dance mixes of three of the singles). From June 15 to August 10, 1985, all seven of his albums appeared on the UK Albums Chart: the first time an artist had charted their entire back catalogue simultaneously.[38]\n\nLive/1975\u201385, a five-record box set (also on three cassettes or three CDs), was released near the end of 1986 and became the first box set to debut at No. 1 on the U.S. album charts. It is one of the most commercially successful live albums of all time, ultimately selling 13 million units in the U.S. Live/1975\u201385 summed up Springsteen's career to that point and displayed some of the elements that made his shows so powerful to his fans: the switching from mournful dirges to party rockers and back; the communal sense of purpose between artist and audience; the long, intense spoken passages before songs, including those describing Springsteen's difficult relationship with his father; and the instrumental prowess of the E Street Band, such as in the long coda to \"Racing in the Street\". Despite its popularity, some fans and critics felt the album's song selection could have been better. Springsteen concerts are the subjects of frequent bootleg recording and trading among fans.\n\nDuring the 1980s, several Springsteen fanzines were launched, including Backstreets magazine, which started in Seattle and continues today as a glossy publication, now in communication with Springsteen's management and official website.\n\nAfter this commercial peak, Springsteen released the much more sedate and contemplative Tunnel of Love album (1987), a mature reflection on the many faces of love found, lost and squandered, which only selectively used the E Street Band. It presaged the breakup of his marriage to Julianne Phillips and described some of his unhappiness in the relationship. Reflecting the challenges of love in \"Brilliant Disguise\", Springsteen sang:\n\nSo tell me who I see when I look in your eyes/Is that you, baby, or just a brilliant disguise?\n\nThe subsequent Tunnel of Love Express Tour shook up fans with changes to the stage layout, favorites dropped from the set list, and horn-based arrangements. During the European leg in 1988, Springsteen's relationship with backup singer Patti Scialfa became public. Phillips and Springsteen filed for divorce in 1988.[39]\n\nSpringsteen performing on the Tunnel of Love Express Tour at the Radrennbahn Wei\u00dfensee in East Berlin on July 19, 1988\n\nOn July 19, 1988, Springsteen held a concert in East Germany that attracted 300,000 spectators. Journalist Erik Kirschbaum has called the concert \"the most important rock concert ever, anywhere\", in his 2013 book Rocking the Wall. Bruce Springsteen: The Berlin Concert That Changed the World. It had been conceived by the Socialist Unity Party's youth wing in an attempt to placate the youth of East Germany, who were hungry for more freedom and the popular music of the West. However, it is Kirschbaum's opinion that the success of the concert catalyzed opposition to the regime in the DDR, and helped contribute to the fall of the Berlin Wall the following year.[40]\n\nLater in 1988, Springsteen headlined the worldwide Human Rights Now! tour for Amnesty International. In late 1989 he dissolved the E Street Band, and he and Scialfa relocated to California, marrying in 1991.\n\n1992\u20131998: Artistic and commercial ups and downs and soundtrack work [ edit ]\n\nIn 1992, after risking fan accusations of \"going Hollywood\" by moving to Los Angeles and working with session musicians, Springsteen released two albums at once. Human Touch and Lucky Town were even more introspective than any of his previous work and displayed a newly revealed confidence. As opposed to his first two albums, which dreamed of happiness, and his next four, which showed him growing to fear it, at points during the Lucky Town album, Springsteen actually claims happiness for himself.\n\nAn electric band appearance on the acoustic MTV Unplugged television program (later released as In Concert/MTV Plugged) was poorly received and further cemented fan dissatisfaction. Springsteen seemed to realize this a few years hence when he spoke humorously of his late father during his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame acceptance speech:\n\nI've gotta thank him because\u2014what would I conceivably have written about without him? I mean, you can imagine that if everything had gone great between us, we would have had disaster. I would have written just happy songs\u2014and I tried it in the early '90s and it didn't work; the public didn't like it.[41]\n\nA multiple Grammy Award winner, Springsteen also won an Academy Award in 1994 for his song \"Streets of Philadelphia\", which appeared on the soundtrack to the film Philadelphia. The video for the song shows Springsteen's actual vocal performance, recorded using a hidden microphone, to a prerecorded instrumental track. This technique was developed on the \"Brilliant Disguise\" video.\n\nIn 1995, after temporarily re-organizing the E Street Band for a few new songs recorded for his first Greatest Hits album (a recording session that was chronicled in the documentary Blood Brothers), and also one show at Tramps in New York City,[42] he released his second (mostly) solo guitar album, The Ghost of Tom Joad, inspired by John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath and by Journey to Nowhere: The Saga of the New Underclass, a book by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Dale Maharidge and photographer Michael Williamson. This was generally less well-received than the similar Nebraska, due to the minimal melody, twangy vocals, and political nature of most of the songs, although some praised it for giving voice to immigrants and others who rarely have one in American culture. The lengthy, worldwide, small-venue solo acoustic Ghost of Tom Joad Tour that followed successfully presented many of his older songs in drastically reshaped acoustic form, although Springsteen had to explicitly remind his audiences to be quiet and not to clap during the performances.\n\nIn April 1996, Springsteen gave an interview to LGBT magazine The Advocate writer Judy Wieder, in which he spoke of the importance of fighting for gay marriage. \"You get your license, you do all the social rituals. It's part of your place in society, and in some way part of society's acceptance of you.\"[43]\n\nFollowing the tour, Springsteen moved back to New Jersey with his family.[44] In 1998, he released the sprawling, four-disc box set of outtakes, Tracks. Later, he would acknowledge that the 1990s were a \"lost period\" for him: \"I didn't do a lot of work. Some people would say I didn't do my best work.\"[45]\n\n1999\u20132007: Return to success [ edit ]\n\nSpringsteen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999 by Bono (the lead singer of U2), a favor he returned in 2005.[46]\n\nIn 1999, Springsteen and the E Street Band reunited and began their extensive Reunion Tour, lasting over a year. Highlights included a record sold-out, 15-show run at Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey and a ten-night, sold-out engagement at New York City's Madison Square Garden, which ended the tour. The final two shows were recorded for HBO, with corresponding DVD and album releases as Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band: Live in New York City. A new song, \"American Skin (41 Shots)\", about the police shooting of Amadou Diallo, which was played at these shows proved controversial.\n\nIn 2002, Springsteen released his first studio effort with the full band in 18 years, The Rising, produced by Brendan O'Brien. The album, mostly a reflection on the September 11 attacks, was a critical and popular success. (Many of the songs were influenced by phone conversations Springsteen had with family members of victims of the attacks who in their obituaries had mentioned how his music touched their lives.) The title track gained airplay in several radio formats, and the record became Springsteen's best-selling album of new material in 15 years. Kicked off by an early-morning Asbury Park appearance on The Today Show, The Rising Tour commenced, barnstorming through a series of single-night arena stands in the U.S. and Europe to promote the album in 2002, then returning for large-scale, multiple-night stadium shows in 2003. While Springsteen had maintained a loyal hardcore fan base everywhere (and particularly in Europe), his general popularity had dipped over the years in some southern and midwestern regions of the U.S. because of his vocal endorsement of leftist, liberal politics. But it was still strong in Europe and along the U.S. coasts, and he played an unprecedented 10 nights in Giants Stadium in New Jersey, a ticket-selling feat to which no other musical act has come close.[47] During these shows Springsteen thanked those fans who were attending multiple shows and those who were coming from long distances or another country; the advent of robust Springsteen-oriented online communities had made such practices more common. The Rising Tour concluded with three nights in Shea Stadium, highlighted by renewed controversy over \"American Skin\" and a guest appearance by Bob Dylan.\n\nDuring the early 2000s, Springsteen became a visible advocate for the revitalization of Asbury Park, and played an annual series of winter holiday concerts there to benefit various local businesses, organizations, and causes. These shows were explicitly intended for the devoted fans, including numbers such as the E Street Shuffle outtake \"Thundercrack\", a rollicking group-participation song that would mystify casual Springsteen fans. He also frequently rehearses for tours in Asbury Park; some of his most devoted followers even stand outside the building to hear what fragments they can of the upcoming shows. The song \"My City of Ruins\" was originally written about Asbury Park, in honor of the attempts to revitalize the city. Looking for an appropriate song for the America: A Tribute to Heroes telethon broadcast, he selected \"My City of Ruins\", which was immediately recognized as an emotional highlight of the broadcast, with its gospel themes and its heartfelt exhortations to \"Rise up!\" The song became associated with post-9/11 New York, and he chose it to close The Rising album and as an encore on the subsequent tour.\n\nAt the Grammy Awards of 2003, Springsteen performed The Clash's \"London Calling\" along with Elvis Costello, Dave Grohl, and E Street Band member Steven Van Zandt and No Doubt's bassist, Tony Kanal, in tribute to Joe Strummer; Springsteen and the Clash had once been considered multiple-album-dueling rivals at the time of the double The River and the triple Sandinista!.\n\nIn 2004, Springsteen and the E Street Band participated in the Vote for Change tour, along with John Mellencamp, John Fogerty, the Dixie Chicks, Pearl Jam, R.E.M., Bright Eyes, the Dave Matthews Band, Jackson Browne, and other musicians. All concerts were to be held in swing states, to benefit the progressive political organization group America Coming Together and to encourage people to register and vote. A finale was held in Washington, D.C., bringing many of the artists together. Several days later, Springsteen held one more such concert in New Jersey, when polls showed that state surprisingly close. While in past years Springsteen had played benefits for causes in which he believed \u2014against nuclear energy, for Vietnam veterans, Amnesty International, and the Christic Institute\u2014he had always refrained from explicitly endorsing candidates for political office (indeed he had rejected the efforts of Walter Mondale to attract an endorsement during the 1984 Reagan \"Born in the U.S.A.\" flap). This new stance led to criticism and praise from the expected partisan sources. Springsteen's \"No Surrender\" became the main campaign theme song for John Kerry's unsuccessful presidential campaign; in the last days of the campaign, he performed acoustic versions of the song and some of his other old songs at Kerry rallies.\n\nDevils & Dust was released on April 26, 2005, and was recorded without the E Street Band. It is a low-key, mostly acoustic album, in the same vein as Nebraska and The Ghost of Tom Joad although with a little more instrumentation. Some of the material was written almost 10 years earlier during, or shortly after, the Ghost of Tom Joad Tour, with a few having been performed then but not released.[48] The title track concerns an ordinary soldier's feelings and fears during the Iraq War. Starbucks rejected a co-branding deal for the album, due in part to some sexually explicit content but also because of Springsteen's anti-corporate politics. The album entered the album charts at No. 1 in 10 countries (United States, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Ireland). Springsteen began the solo Devils & Dust Tour at the same time as the album's release, playing both small and large venues. Attendance was disappointing in a few regions, and everywhere (other than in Europe) tickets were easier to get than in the past. Unlike his mid-1990s solo tour, he performed on piano, electric piano, pump organ, autoharp, ukulele, banjo, electric guitar, and stomping board, as well as acoustic guitar and harmonica, adding variety to the solo sound. (Offstage synthesizer, guitar, and percussion were also used for some songs.)\n\nIn November 2005, Sirius Satellite Radio started a 24-hour, seven-day-a-week radio station called E Street Radio. This channel played commercial-free Bruce Springsteen music, including rare tracks, interviews, and daily concerts of Bruce Springsteen & the E Street Band recorded throughout their career.\n\nIn April 2006, Springsteen released We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions, an American roots music project focused around a big folk sound treatment of 15 songs popularized by the radical musical activism of Pete Seeger. It was recorded with a large ensemble of musicians including only Patti Scialfa, Soozie Tyrell, and The Miami Horns from past efforts. In contrast to previous albums, this was recorded in only three one-day sessions, and frequently one can hear Springsteen calling out key changes live as the band explores its way through the tracks. A tour began the same month, with the 18-strong ensemble of musicians dubbed The Seeger Sessions Band (and later shortened to The Sessions Band). Seeger Sessions material was emphasized, as well as a handful of (usually drastically rearranged) Springsteen numbers. The tour proved very popular in Europe, selling out everywhere and receiving some excellent reviews,[49] but newspapers reported that a number of U.S. shows suffered from sparse attendance.[50][51][52] By the end of 2006, the Seeger Sessions tour toured Europe twice and toured America for only a short span. Bruce Springsteen with The Sessions Band: Live in Dublin, containing selections from three nights of November 2006 shows at the Point Theatre in Dublin, Ireland, was released the following June.\n\nSpringsteen's next album, titled Magic, was released on October 2, 2007. Recorded with the E Street Band, it had 10 new Springsteen songs plus \"Long Walk Home\", performed once with the Sessions band, and a hidden track (the first included on a Springsteen studio release), \"Terry's Song\", a tribute to Springsteen's long-time assistant Terry Magovern, who died on July 30, 2007.[53] Magic debuted at No. 1 in Ireland and the UK. Greatest Hits reentered the Irish charts at No. 57, and Live in Dublin almost cracked the top 20 in Norway again. Sirius Satellite Radio also restarted E Street Radio on September 27, 2007, in anticipation of Magic.[54] Radio conglomerate Clear Channel Communications was alleged to have sent an edict to its classic rock stations to not play any songs from the new album, while continuing to play older Springsteen material. However, Clear Channel Adult Alternative (or \"AAA\") station KBCO did play tracks from the album, undermining the allegations of a corporate blackout.[55]\n\nThe Springsteen and E Street Band Magic Tour began at the Hartford Civic Center with the album's release and continued through North America and Europe.\n\nIt was announced on November 21, 2007, that Springsteen's longtime friend and founding E Street Band member, Danny Federici, would be taking a leave of absence from the Magic Tour to pursue treatment for melanoma. Charles Giordano filled in as Federici's replacement.\n\n2008\u20132011: Deaths of Danny Federici and Clarence Clemons [ edit ]\n\nFederici returned to the stage on March 20, 2008, when he appeared for portions of a Springsteen and E Street Band performance at Conseco Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. Less than one month later, on April 17, 2008, Federici died at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, having suffered for three years from melanoma.[56][57]\n\nOn January 11, 2009, Springsteen won the Golden Globe Award for Best Song for \"The Wrestler\", from the Darren Aronofsky film by the same name.[58] After receiving a heartfelt letter from lead actor Mickey Rourke, Springsteen supplied the song for the film for free.[59]\n\nSpringsteen performed at the halftime show at Super Bowl XLIII on February 1, 2009,[60] agreeing to do it after many previous offers.[61] A few days before the game, Springsteen gave a rare press conference at which he promised a \"twelve-minute party.\"[62][63] His 12-minute 45-second set, with the E Street Band and the Miami Horns, included abbreviated renditions of \"Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out\"\", \"Born to Run\", \"Working on a Dream\", and \"Glory Days\", the latter complete with football references in place of the original baseball-themed lyrics. The set of appearances and promotional activities led Springsteen to say, \"This has probably been the busiest month of my life.\"[64]\n\nSpringsteen supported Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign, announcing his endorsement in April 2008[65] and going on to appear at several Obama rallies as well as performing several solo acoustic performances in support of Obama's campaign throughout 2008,[66] culminating with a November 2 rally at which he debuted the song \"Working on a Dream\" in a duet with Scialfa.[67] At an Ohio rally, Springsteen discussed the importance of \"truth, transparency and integrity in government, the right of every American to have a job, a living wage, to be educated in a decent school, and a life filled with the dignity of work, the promise and the sanctity of home...\"[68]\n\nFollowing Obama's electoral victory on November 4, Springsteen's song \"The Rising\" was the first song played over the loudspeakers after Obama's victory speech in Chicago's Grant Park. Springsteen was the musical opener for the Obama Inaugural Celebration on January 18, 2009, which was attended by over 400,000 people.[69] He performed \"The Rising\" with an all-female choir. Later he performed Woody Guthrie's \"This Land Is Your Land\" with Pete Seeger.\n\nSpringsteen's Working on a Dream album, dedicated to the memory of Danny Federici, was released in late January 2009[62] and the supporting Working on a Dream Tour ran from April 2009 until November 2009. The tour presented few songs from the new album, with set lists dominated instead by classics and selections reflecting the ongoing late-2000s recession.[70] Springsteen also played songs requested by audience members holding up signs, a practice begun during the final stages of the Magic Tour.[70] Drummer Max Weinberg was replaced for some shows by his 18-year-old son Jay Weinberg, so that the former could serve his role as bandleader on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien.[70] During this tour, Springsteen and the band made their first real foray in the world of music festivals, headlining nights at the Pinkpop Festival in the Netherlands, Festival des Vieilles Charrues in France, the Bonnaroo Music Festival in the United States and the Glastonbury Festival[71] and Hard Rock Calling in the UK.[72] Several shows on the tour presented Born to Run, Darkness on the Edge of Town, or Born in the U.S.A. in its entirety.[73] The band performed five final shows at Giants Stadium, opening with a new song highlighting the historic stadium, and Springsteen's Jersey roots, named \"Wrecking Ball\".[74] A DVD from the Working on a Dream Tour entitled London Calling: Live in Hyde Park was released in 2010.\n\nFireworks go off at the conclusion of the \"E! Street! Band!\" exhortation during the final shows at Giants Stadium\n\nSpringsteen was among the recipients of the Kennedy Center Honors, an annual award to figures from the world of arts for their contribution to American culture, on December 6, 2009.[75] President Obama gave a speech in which he talked about how Springsteen had incorporated the life of regular Americans in his expansive palette of songs and how his concerts were beyond typical rock-and-roll concerts, how, apart from being high-energy concerts, they were \"communions\". He ended the remark \"while I am the president, he is the Boss\". Tributes were paid by several well-known celebrities including Jon Stewart (who described Springsteen's \"unprecedented combination of lyrical eloquence, musical mastery and sheer unbridled, unadulterated joy\"). A musical tribute included John Mellencamp, Ben Harper, Jennifer Nettles, Melissa Etheridge, Eddie Vedder, and Sting.\n\nSpringsteen was among a host of musicians who voiced extensive criticism regarding the merging of Ticketmaster with Live Nation, saying \"the one thing that would make the current ticket situation even worse for the fan than it is now would be Ticketmaster and Live Nation coming up with a single system, thereby returning us to a near monopoly situation in music ticketing.\"[76]\n\nThe 2000s ended with Springsteen named one of eight Artists of the Decade by Rolling Stone magazine[77] and with Springsteen's tours ranking him fourth among artists in total concert grosses for the decade.[78] His 2010 tour included venues in the UK and Ireland.\n\nIn September 2010, a documentary about the making of Springsteen's 1978 album Darkness on the Edge of Town premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. The film, The Promise: The Making of Darkness on the Edge of Town, was included in a box set reissue of the album, entitled The Promise: The Darkness on the Edge of Town Story, released in November 2010. Also airing on HBO, the documentary explored Springsteen's making of the album and his role in the production and development of the tracks.\n\nClarence Clemons, the E Street Band's saxophonist and founding member, died on June 18, 2011, of complications from a stroke. \"Clarence lived a wonderful life\", Springsteen said. \"He carried within him a love of people that made them love him. He created a wondrous and extended family. He loved the saxophone, loved our fans and gave everything he had every night he stepped on stage.\"[79]\n\n2012\u20132015: Wrecking Ball, High Hopes, American Beauty and The Ties That Bind box set [ edit ]\n\nSpringsteen's 17th studio album, Wrecking Ball, was released on March 6, 2012. The album consists of eleven tracks plus two bonus tracks. Three songs previously only available as live versions\u2014\"Wrecking Ball\", \"Land of Hope and Dreams\", and \"American Land\"\u2014appear on the album.[80] Wrecking Ball became Springsteen's tenth No. 1 album in the United States, tying him with Elvis Presley for third most No. 1 albums of all-time. Only The Beatles (19) and Jay Z (12) have more No. 1 albums.[81]\n\nFollowing the release of the album, Springsteen and the E Street Band announced plans for the Wrecking Ball Tour, which began on March 18, 2012. As tickets for the first U.S. dates went on sale, many fans were unable to obtain tickets, much like for the 2009 Working on a Dream Tour, allegedly due to ticket scalpers. Shows sold out within minutes and many tickets appeared, at much higher prices, on resale websites such as StubHub less than an hour after the onsale time. Ticketmaster said web traffic was 2.5 times the highest level of the past year during the online sales and suggested that scalpers played a big role. On July 31, 2012, in Helsinki, Finland, Springsteen performed his longest concert ever at 4 hours and 6 minutes and 33 songs. Not included in this total time is a thirty-minute, five-song, solo acoustical set he did about two hours before the show.[82]\n\nSpringsteen was honored with the 2013 MusiCares Person of the Year award in recognition of his creative accomplishments as well as his charitable work and philanthropic activities. A ceremony was held on February 8, 2013, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, two days before the Grammy Awards.[83]\n\nDespite saying he would sit out the 2012 presidential election, Springsteen campaigned for President Barack Obama's re-election in Ohio, Iowa, Virginia, Pittsburgh, and Wisconsin. At the rallies, he briefly spoke to the audience and performed a short acoustic set that included a newly written song titled \"Forward\".[84][85][86] Obama also used \"We Take Care of Our Own\" as one of his top campaign songs. Use of the song helped boost sales of the song by 409%.[87]\n\nOn October 29, 2012, the New Jersey area was hit hard by Hurricane Sandy. Two days later, Springsteen dedicated his performance at the Blue Cross Arena in Rochester, New York, to those affected by the storm and those helping to recover. Springsteen and the E Street Band performed \"Land of Hope and Dreams\" at a one-hour televised telethon called Hurricane Sandy: Coming Together on November 2, 2012, which aired on NBC and at the same time many other channels. Springsteen also joined Billy Joel, Steven Tyler and Jimmy Fallon for a performance of \"Under the Boardwalk\". All money was donated to the American Red Cross.[88] Springsteen and the E Street Band, along with many top names in the music industry, performed at Madison Square Garden on December 12, 2012, for 12-12-12: The Concert for Sandy Relief.\n\nAt year's end, the Wrecking Ball Tour was named Top Draw for having the top attendance out of any tour by the Billboard Touring Awards. The tour finished second to Roger Waters, who had the top grossing tour of 2012.[89] Springsteen finished second only to Madonna as the top money maker of 2012 with $33.44 million.[90] The Wrecking Ball album, along with the single \"We Take Care of Our Own\", was nominated for three Grammy Awards, including Best Rock Performance and Best Rock Song for \"We Take Care of Our Own\" and Best Rock Album.[91][92] Rolling Stone named Wrecking Ball the number one album of 2012 on their Top 50 albums of 2012 list.[93]\n\nIn March 2013, and for the first time since re-uniting with Springsteen in 1999, Steven Van Zandt was forced to miss the Australian leg of the band's tour due to acting commitments on his television show Lilyhammer. He was replaced by guitarist Tom Morello for the leg.[94]\n\nIn late July 2013, the documentary Springsteen & I, directed by Baillie Walsh and produced by Ridley Scott, was released simultaneously via a worldwide cinema broadcast in over 50 countries and in over 2000 movie theaters.[95]\n\nThe Wrecking Ball Tour, which came to an end in September 2013, was one of Springsteen's most successful. A week after it ended, Springsteen announced a 2014 tour that would include dates in Australia and New Zealand.[96]\n\nSpringsteen, along with friend and mentor Pete Seeger, as well as Herbie Hancock, Sally Field and Robert De Niro, was among a total of 198 class of 2013 inductees into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. The induction ceremony was held at the Academy's headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts in October 2013.\n\nIn October 2013, Springsteen posted a letter on his website thanking fans of all ages for their support throughout the Wrecking Ball World Tour. A highlight video of the tour was also released showing a new studio recording of the Suicide song, \"Dream Baby Dream\".[97]\n\nSpringsteen released his eighteenth studio album, High Hopes, on January 14, 2014. The first single and video were of a newly recorded version of the song \"High Hopes\", which Springsteen had previously recorded in 1995. The album was the first by Springsteen in which all songs are either cover songs, newly recorded outtakes from previous records, or newly recorded versions of songs previously released. The 2014 E Street Band touring lineup, along with deceased E Street Band members Clarence Clemons and Danny Federici, appears on the album along with guitarist Tom Morello.[98]\n\nIt was announced on January 15, 2014 that Springsteen would start making professional recordings of all of his live shows available following each performance on his upcoming tour via download to a special USB wristband.[99] In addition to the wristbands, shows will also be offered through Springsteen's website until June 30, 2014.[100] Springsteen along with the E Street Band and guitarist Tom Morello, kicked off the High Hopes Tour on January 26, 2014. The tour was considered to be a continuation of the Wrecking Ball Tour.\n\nHigh Hopes became Springsteen's eleventh No. 1 album in the US.[101] It was his tenth No. 1 in the UK, tying him for fifth all-time The Rolling Stones and U2.[102] On April 4, 2014, HBO aired Bruce Springsteen's High Hopes a 30-minute documentary on the recording of High Hopes.[103] Rolling Stone named High Hopes the second best album of the year (behind only U2's Songs of Innocence) on their Top 50 Albums of 2014 list.[104]\n\nAnnounced as inductees in December 2013, Springsteen inducted past and present members of the E Street Band into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on April 10, 2014, with each member giving a speech and Springsteen and the band performing a three-song set of \"The E Street Shuffle\", \"The River\" and \"Kitty's Back\".[105]\n\nAmerican Beauty, a limited edition four-song EP on 12-inch vinyl released exclusively for Record Store Day on April 18, 2014 contains four unreleased songs from the High Hopes sessions.[106] A music video for the title track was also released. After 34 shows and 182 songs performed, the High Hopes Tour came to an end on May 18, 2014. Springsteen released a short film for the song \"Hunter of Invisible Game\" on July 9, 2014 through his website. It marked Springsteen's directorial debut.[107]\n\nOn November 17, 2014, Springsteen released The Album Collection Vol. 1 1973-1984, an 8-disc remastered version of his first seven studio albums, some of which had been remastered for the first time.[108]\n\nSpringsteen made his acting debut in the final episode of Season 3 of Van Zandt's show Lilyhammer, which was named \"Loose Ends\", after a Springsteen song on his album Tracks. He played Giuseppe Tagliano, the brother of Van Zandt's character, Frank Tagliano aka \"Giovanni \"Johnny\" Henrikssen\". Giuseppe is an undertaker and owner of a funeral parlor who occasionally works as a hitman for a mafia family which Frank is associated.\n\nIn November 2014, Springsteen announced that he would be opening the Bruce Springsteen Archives and will release live concerts from throughout his career including many shows which fans consider to be among his most essential performances and that were only previously available through bootlegs. Each show has been completely restored, remixed and remastered for the highest possible sound quality and are available for purchase through digital download or CD at live.brucespringsteen.net, where fans can also buy all of Springsteen's live recordings from the High Hopes Tour.[109]\n\nOn August 6, 2015, Springsteen performed \"Land of Hope and Dreams\" and \"Born to Run\" on the final episode of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, as Stewart's final 'Moment of Zen'. On October 16, to celebrate the 35th anniversary of The River, Springsteen announced The Ties That Bind: The River Collection box set. Released on December 4, it contains four CDs (including many previously unreleased songs) and three DVDs (or Blu-ray) along with a 148-page coffee table book. In November 2015, \"American Skin (41 Shots)\" was performed with John Legend at Shining a Light: A Concert for Progress on Race in America.\n\nSpringsteen made his first appearance on Saturday Night Live since 2002 on December 19, 2015, performing \"Meet Me in the City\", \"The Ties That Bind\", and \"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\".[110] On December 4, 2015, he announced details for the upcoming The River Tour 2016 which would begin the following year. Springsteen also discussed plans for a new solo album however plans were put on hold to tour with the E Street Band in support of The Ties That Bind: The River Collection. Springsteen said \"the project I've been working on is more of a solo project. It wasn't a project I was going to probably take the band out on. So I said, 'Gee, that's going to push the band playing again until a ways in the future. It'll be nice to get some playing in so you don't wind up being two or three years between E Street tours.\"[111]\n\n2016\u2013present: The River Tour 2016/Summer '17, Chapter and Verse, autobiography and Broadway performances [ edit ]\n\nThe River Tour 2016 began in January 2016 in support of The Ties That Bind: The River Collection box set. All first-leg shows in North America included an in-sequence performance of the entire The River album along with other songs from Springsteen's catalog, and all dates were recorded and made available for purchase.[112] More dates were eventually announced expanding the original three-month tour into a seven-month tour with shows in Europe in May 2016 and another North American leg starting in August 2016 and ending the following month. As of July 2016, The River 2016 Tour has been the highest grossing worldwide tour with 1.1 million tickets sold and over $135 million in box office revenue, according to Billboard Boxscore's mid-year report.\n\nIn July 2016, Springsteen's manager, Jon Landau, discussed Springsteen's upcoming solo album, which is expected for release in 2017, saying \"All I can say is that there is a solo record \u2013 and when I say solo record, I'm not talking about an acoustic record. It is, in fact, a very expansive record, a very rich record. It's one of Bruce's very creative efforts. Stay tuned, and we'll see exactly how that shapes up next year.\" Landau also said it was too early to know a release day or plans for a supporting tour.[113]\n\nOn September 23, 2016, Chapter and Verse, a compilation from throughout Springsteen's career dating back to 1966, was released. Five of the album's eighteen tracks had not been previously released; they include Springsteen's earliest recording from 1966, songs from his tenure in early 1970s bands such as the Castiles, Steel Mill and The Bruce Springsteen Band, along with a track from each studio album of his career.[114] On September 27, 2016, Simon & Schuster published his 500-page autobiography, Born to Run. The book rose quickly to the top of the NY Times Best Sellers List.[115] Springsteen announced he would promote his autobiography with a seventeen date book tour from September to December 2016.[116]\n\nSpringsteen receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom at the White House from President Barack Obama\n\nSpringsteen began the final leg of The River 2016 Tour on August 23, 2016, at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey where he performed for 3 hours and 52 minutes making it at the time the longest show he had ever performed in the United States.[117] The record was broken two nights later at MetLife Stadium when Springsteen performed a 3-hour 59-minute show, later topped by his performance of August 30, 2016, at 4 hours and 1 minute which then stood as his longest show in the United States. That record again was topped on September 7, 2016, at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where Springsteen performed for 4 hours and 4 minutes, which now stands as his longest show in the United States and second-longest ever next to a 2012 show in Helsinki which lasted two minutes longer.[118][119] The tour ended in September 2016; however, dates from January 22, 2017 to February 25, 2017 were added using the same promotional image from The River Tour 2016 although the tour was now renamed the Summer '17 tour.[120] The River 2016 Tour was the top-grossing worldwide tour of 2016; it pulled in $268.3 million globally and was the highest grossing tour since 2014 for any artist topping Taylor Swift's 2015 tour which grossed $250.1 million.[121]\n\nSpringsteen supported Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign by performing an acoustic set of \"Thunder Road\", \"Long Walk Home\" and \"Dancing in the Dark\" at a rally in Philadelphia on November 7, 2016. On November 22, 2016, Springsteen was presented\u2014along with twenty other recipients\u2014the Presidential Medal of Freedom award by Barack Obama.[122] The award is the highest honor for a civilian to receive and is \"presented to individuals who have made especially meritorious contributions to the security or national interests of the United States, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.\"[123] On January 12, 2017, Springsteen along with Patti Scialfa performed a special 15-song acoustic set for President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama at the White House's East Room two days before the president gave his farewell address to the nation.[124][125]\n\nSpringsteen on Broadway, an eight-week run at the Walter Kerr Theatre on Broadway in New York City in fall 2017, was announced in June 2017[126] and in addition to his music, includes Springsteen reading excerpts from his 2016 autobiography Born to Run and performing other spoken reminiscences written for the show.[127] Originally scheduled to run from October 12 through November 26, the show was extended three times, the last performance now scheduled for December 15, 2018.[128][129][130]\n\nWith rumors swirling that Springsteen's solo shows on Broadway could continue well past their current June 2018 end date, on January 18, 2018, Nils Lofgren was asked on Twitter if the E Street Band will ever tour with Bruce again. Lofgren responded saying \"I sure hope so\" however Gary Tallent responded saying that it was \"looking unlikely though\" fueling rumors of the end of the E Street Band.[131][132] The following day, Tallent responded to his original comment saying \"just to be clear, I know as much as you. I like Nils' answer better\".[133] On February 2, 2018, Max Weinberg commented on the future of the E Street Band performing with Springsteen saying \"Don\u2019t worry, we ain\u2019t done yet. The E Street Band will be back out on the road.\" [134]\n\nFor Springsteen\u2019s production of Springsteen on Broadway, he will be honored with a special award at the upcoming Tony Awards as announced on May 1, 2018.[135]\n\nMusical style [ edit ]\n\nSpringsteen (second from right) was among the five recipients of the 2009 Kennedy Center Honors\n\nSpringsteen draws on many musical influences from the reservoir of traditional American popular music, folk, blues and country. From the beginning, rock and roll has been a dominant influence and Springsteen's musical and lyrical evocations, as well as public tributes, of artists such as Dylan, Presley, The Animals, Roy Orbison, Gary \"U.S.\" Bonds, and many others helped to rekindle interest in their music. Springsteen's other preferred musical style is American folk, evident on his debut album, Greetings from Asbury Park, New Jersey, and more strongly on Nebraska and The Ghost of Tom Joad. Springsteen songs such as \"This Hard Land\" demonstrate the lyrical and musical influence of Woody Guthrie.\n\nElements of Latin American music, jazz, soul, and funk influences can be heard on Springsteen's second album, The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle; the song \"New York City Serenade\" is even reminiscent of the music of George Gershwin. Prominent in these two records is the pianist David Sancious, who left the band shortly into the recording of Springsteen's third album, Born To Run (which also emphasized the piano, played by Roy Bittan).\n\nSubsequently, Springsteen focused more on the rock elements of his music. He initially compressed the sound and developed Darkness on the Edge of Town just as straightforward as concise musical idiom, for the simple riffs, rock guitar solos and clearly recognizable song structures are dominant. His music has been categorized as heartland rock, a style typified by Springsteen, John Fogerty, Tom Petty, Bob Seger, and John Mellencamp. This music has a lyrical reference to the U.S. everyday and the music is kept rather simple and straightforward. This development culminated with Springsteen's hit album Born in the U.S.A., the title song of which has a constantly repeating, fanfare-like keyboard riff and a pounding drum beat. These sounds fit with Springsteen's voice: it cries to the listener the unsentimental story of a disenchanted angry figure. Even songs that can be argued to be album tracks proved to be singles that enjoyed some chart success, such as \"My Hometown\" and \"I'm on Fire\", in which the drum line is formed from subtle hi-hat and rim-clicks-shock (shock at the edge of the snare drum) accompanied by synthesizer and Springsteen's soft guitar line. The album, along with some previous records such as \"Cadillac Ranch\" showed clear rockabilly influences as is evident from his guitar solos, in-fills and vocal styles on these. Another clear influence of early rock n roll on Springsteen's music is evident on the song \"Light of Day\".[citation needed]\n\nIn recent years, Springsteen has changed his music further. There are more folk elements up to the gospel to be heard. His last solo album, Devils and Dust, drew rave reviews not only for Springsteen's complex songwriting, but also for his expressive and sensitive singing.\n\nOn the album We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions Springsteen performed folk classics with a folk band, rather than his usual E Street Band. On his ensuing tour he also interpreted some of his own rock songs in a folk style.\n\nOn his 2012 album, Wrecking Ball, Springsteen incorporated a variety of styles, including folk, gospel, and even hip-hop, with a rap in the song \"Rocky Ground\". His studio work with producer Ron Aniello, Wrecking Ball and High Hopes, has also become more experimental, featuring loops and computerized sounds.\n\nLyrical themes [ edit ]\n\n\"I spent most of my life as a musician measuring the distance between the American Dream and American reality.\" \u2014Bruce Springsteen[136][note 2]\n\nOften described as cinematic in their scope, Springsteen's lyrics frequently explore highly personal themes such as individual commitment, dissatisfaction and dismay with life in a context of everyday situations.[137]\n\nIt has been recognized that there was a shift in his lyrical approach starting with the album Darkness on the Edge of Town, in which he focused on the emotional struggles of working class life.[138][139]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nThe Springsteen family greets the Obama family on-stage at a rally in Cleveland , Ohio on November 2, 2008.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Springsteen met Patti Scialfa at The Stone Pony, a bar in New Jersey where local musicians regularly perform. On that particular evening she was performing alongside one of Springsteen's pals, Bobby Bandiera, with whom she had written \"At Least We Got Shoes\" for Southside Johnny. Springsteen liked her voice and after the performance, introduced himself to her. Soon after that, they started spending time together and became friends.[140]\n\nEarly in 1984, Springsteen asked Scialfa to join the E Street Band for the upcoming Born in the U.S.A. Tour. According to the book Bruce Springsteen on Tour 1969\u20132005 by Dave Marsh, it looked like Springsteen and Scialfa were on the brink of becoming a couple through the first leg of the tour. But before that could happen, Barry Bell introduced actress/model Julianne Phillips (b.1960) to Springsteen; they were married on May 13, 1985, held shortly after midnight at Our Lady of the Lake Catholic Church in Lake Oswego, a suburb south of Portland, Oregon.[141][142][143] Opposites in background, the two had an 11-year age difference, and his traveling took its toll on their relationship. His next album, Tunnel of Love, was released in the autumn of 1987 and many of its songs described his unhappiness in the relationship with Phillips.\n\nThe Tunnel of Love Express Tour began in late February 1988, and Springsteen convinced Scialfa to join the tour again. She expressed reluctance at first, since she wanted to start recording her first solo album, but after Springsteen told her that the tour would be short, she agreed to postpone her own solo record.[144] Phillips and Springsteen separated in the spring of 1988, but it wasn't made known to the press. Springsteen and Scialfa fell in love with each other during the Tunnel of Love Express Tour and started living together soon after his separation from Phillips. Citing irreconcilable differences, Julianne filed for divorce in Los Angeles on August 30, 1988;[145] a settlement was reached in December and it was finalized on March 1, 1989.[146][147]\n\nSpringsteen received press criticism for the hastiness in which he and Scialfa took up their relationship. In a 1995 interview with The Advocate, Springsteen told Judy Wieder about the negative publicity the couple subsequently received. \"It's a strange society that assumes it has the right to tell people whom they should love and whom they shouldn't. But the truth is, I basically ignored the entire thing as much as I could. I said, 'Well, all I know is, this feels real, and maybe I have got a mess going here in some fashion, but that's life.'\" He also told Wieder that, \"I went through a divorce, and it was really difficult and painful and I was very frightened about getting married again. So part of me said, 'Hey, what does it matter?' But it does matter. It's very different than just living together. First of all, stepping up publicly\u2014which is what you do: You get your license, you do all the social rituals\u2014is a part of your place in society and in some way part of society's acceptance of you ... Patti and I both found that it did mean something.\"[43]\n\nSpringsteen and Scialfa lived in New Jersey, before moving to Los Angeles, where they decided to start a family.[148] On July 25, 1990, Scialfa gave birth to the couple's first child, Evan James Springsteen.[148][149] On June 8, 1991, Springsteen and Scialfa married at their Los Angeles home in a very private ceremony, only attended by family and close friends.[148][149] Their second child, Jessica Rae Springsteen, was born on December 30, 1991;[148][149] and their third child, Samuel Ryan Springsteen, was born on January 5, 1994.[149][150]\n\nWhen the children reached school-age in the 1990s, Springsteen and Scialfa moved back to New Jersey specifically to raise a family in a non-paparazzi environment. The grounds of his New Jersey home include a large swimming pool. The family owns and lives on a horse farm in Colts Neck and a home in Rumson; they also own homes in Los Angeles and Wellington, Florida.\n\nElder son Evan graduated from Boston College; he writes and performs his own songs and won the 2012 Singer/Songwriter Competition held during the Boston College's Arts Festival.[151] Their daughter Jessica is a nationally ranked champion equestrian,[152] and graduated from Duke University. She made her show-jumping debut with the Team USA in August 2014.[153] Their younger son, Sam, is a firefighter.[154]\n\nIt has been reported that the press conference regarding the 2009 Super Bowl XLIII half-time show was Springsteen's first press conference in more than 25 years.[155] However, he has appeared in a few radio interviews, most notably on NPR and BBC.[156] 60 Minutes aired one of his last extensive interviews on TV[157] before his tour to support his album, Magic. Springsteen has talked about his mental health struggles.[158]\n\nSpringsteen is an activist for LGBT rights and has spoken out many times as a strong supporter of gay marriage. In 2009, he posted the following statement on his website: \"I've long believed in and have always spoken out for the rights of same sex couples and fully agree with Governor Corzine when he writes that 'The marriage-equality issue should be recognized for what it truly is\u2014a civil rights issue that must be approved to assure that every citizen is treated equally under the law.'\"[159] In 2012, he lent his support to an ad campaign for gay marriage called \"The Four 2012\". Springsteen noted in the ad, \"I couldn't agree more with that statement and urge those who support equal treatment for our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters to let their voices be heard now.\"[160] In April 2016, Springsteen cancelled a show in Greensboro, North Carolina days before it was to take place to protest the state's newly passed Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, also referred to as the \"bathroom law\", which dictates which restrooms transgender people are permitted to use and prevents LGBT citizens from suing over human rights violations in the workplace. Springsteen released an official statement on his website. The Human Rights Campaign (HRC) celebrated Springsteen's statement and he has received much praise and gratitude from the LGBT community. [161]\n\nSpringsteen was out riding his motorcycle on November 11, 2016 when it broke down and he was stranded alongside the road. A group of men from the Freehold American Legion in New Jersey were returning from a Veterans Day event on their motorcycles when they spotted Springsteen and stopped to help. Springsteen hitched a ride on the back of one of the men's motorcycles to a nearby restaurant where the group grabbed a round of drinks, for which Springsteen picked up the tab, while waiting for his ride.[162]\n\nWhile rejecting religion in his earlier years, Bruce stated in his autobiography Born To Run, he has \"a personal relationship with Jesus. I believe in his power to save, love... but not to damn\". In terms of Catholic faith, he has stated that he \"came to ruefully and bemusedly understand that once you're a Catholic you're always a Catholic\" and \"I don't participate in my religion but I know somewhere... deep inside... I'm still on the team.\"[163]\n\nIn an interview in 2017 with Tom Hanks, Springsteen admitted to having been a tax evader early in his career.[164]\n\nBands [ edit ]\n\nSpringsteen has been a member of, or has been backed by, several bands during his career, most notably the E Street Band. Earlier bands include the Rogues, the Castiles, Earth, Child, Steel Mill, the Sundance Blues Band, Dr Zoom and the Sonic Boom, and the Bruce Springsteen Band.[165] In October 1972 he formed a new band for the recording of his debut album Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J., which became known as The E Street Band, although the name was not used until September 1974.[166][167] Suki Lahav who was born on a kibbutz in Israel played violin with the E Street band as an unofficial member during live shows in the 1970s.[168]\n\nThe E Street Band performed on all of Springsteen's recorded works from his debut until 1982's Nebraska, a solo album on which Springsteen himself played all the instruments. The full band returned for the next album Born in the USA, but from 1988 to 1999, albums were recorded with session musicians. The E Street Band briefly reunited in 1995 for new contributions to the Greatest Hits compilation, and on a more permanent basis from 1999, since which time they have recorded more albums and performed a number of high-profile tours. The 2005 album Devils & Dust was largely a solo recording, with some contribution from session musicians and the 2006 folk rock We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions album was recorded and toured with another band, known as The Sessions Band.\n\nDiscography [ edit ]\n\nStudio albums [ edit ]\n\nLive albums [ edit ]\n\nConcert tours [ edit ]\n\nHeadlining tours\n\nCo-headlining tours\n\nAwards and nominations [ edit ]\n\nAcademy Awards [ edit ]\n\nAmerican Music Awards [ edit ]\n\nAudie Awards [ edit ]\n\nYear Nominee/work Award Result 2018 Born to Run Best Autobiography/Memoir Won\n\nBRIT Awards [ edit ]\n\nYear Nominee/work Award Result 1985 Himself Best International Solo Artist Nominated 1986 Himself Best International Solo Artist Won 1987 Himself Best International Solo Artist Nominated 2003 Himself International Male Solo Artist Nominated 2006 Himself International Male Solo Artist Nominated 2008 Himself International Male Solo Artist Nominated 2010 Himself International Male Solo Artist Nominated 2011 Himself International Male Solo Artist Nominated 2013 Himself International Male Solo Artist Nominated\n\nGolden Globe Awards [ edit ]\n\nGrammy Awards [ edit ]\n\nSpringsteen has won 20 Grammy Awards out of 50 nominations.\n\nJuno Awards [ edit ]\n\nYear Nominee/work Award Result 1985 Born in the USA International Album of the Year Won 1993 Himself International Entertainer of the Year Nominated\n\nGrammy Hall of Fame [ edit ]\n\nMTV Video Music Awards [ edit ]\n\nTony Awards [ edit ]\n\nYear Nominee/work Award Result 2018 Himself Special Tony Award Won\n\nOther recognition [ edit ]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\n^ \"Blinded by the Light\" would later be a hit for Manfred Mann and reach No. 1, the only time Springsteen had a No. 1 single as a songwriter. ^ This quote is an excerpt from Springsteen's speech from the stage at a rally for presidential candidate Barack Obama on November 2, 2008\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nSources"}

But until recently she was only known among elite academic and architectural circles before blazing a trail through social echelons normally reserved for only A-list stars.

Her accolades are many as she was chosen as one of ICON\u2019s 'top most influential designers and architects to shape our future' and Esquire\u2019s 'best and brightest' in 2009. In 2014, Oxman was even named to Carnegie\u2019s Pride of America. Background: She was born and raised in Haifa, Israel, to architect parents She was born and raised in Haifa, Israel, to her parents Robert and Rivka Oxman, who are both architects themselves. She has previously said she spent her youth straddling the worlds presented to her by her grandmother and her cosmopolitan and artistic parents. Neri has said her grandmother's garden represented nature for her while her parent's architectural studio was a special space where she immersed herself in culture. She moved to Jerusalem to Hebrew University's Hadassah Medical School in 1997 but within two years she had shifted her focus from medicine to architecture which took her to Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. She later attended the London Architectural Association School of Architecture and graduated in 2004. One year later she was in Boston to earn her PhD at MIT and by 2010 she was already an associate professor at the world renowned institution.
